The graph depics the level of unemployment over two years (2014 and 2015). There are few regions in the diagram: North Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America and South Asia. Trend which is called “Worldwide”, shows the average unemployment rate over the world.
The rate of unemployment stays steady in such world regions as North Africa and South Asia. Worldwide rate is also stable. Middle East shows downward trend – unemployment rate declined for a year. we can suppose that increased level in European Union can correlate with amount of migrants from African countries: the more migrants Europe takes, the higher level of unemployment becomes. Statistics over the world didn’t change – the rate stayed the same.
Generally, the highest rate of unemployment relates to North Africa. It is the poorest region with low economics and GDP, so there are not workplaces for population and they need to run from country. The best stable result is shown by South Asia with growing factories, developing infrastructure, so it give across to a big amount of workplaces.
