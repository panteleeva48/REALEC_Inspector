It is obvious that sport helps us to become healthier. We have a lot of opportunities in our everyday life. The sphere of fitness is very popular nowadays but it is very expensive. Not all people can efford it. If government provides more cheap facilities, more people will use it and it will lead to improve in public health. I agree with this opinion, I tend to believe that it is the best way to solve this problem. Another people argue that this would have little effect on public health. They choose other  ways to improve of them. One of these ways is reduce prodaction of unhealthy or junk food. All of us know this food influence on our health and destroy it. If people avoid to it unhealthy food and eat more fruits and vegetables, it will increase the level of public health.

Increasing prison sentence can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about risk of spending most of their lifes in prison. But there is another side of  this solution. First of all, prosins will take more money. From country budget as prison has to spent more on every prisoner. Second and may be even more important. Criminals will go for a higher crimes to avoid prison. For example, theift can kill a man to avoid being caughted. Last problem is connects with the first one. Government will ned to built more prisons to keep all criminals. It also have money from budget. But do we have after native ways? Yes, there are some other possible silutions to prevent crime. First one is reducing number of unemployment people. A lot of people go for crime just because they do not have something do it. Giving them job can prevent them from going for crime. Second approach is to start with children. Most of the crimals start doing illegal brings from the childhood.

However it contributes great harm to the nature, especially to air, that it is why some people believe that goverments should control the traffic of air travelling by special laws. I strongly agree with this point of view and in this essay I will explain why.

First of all, almost all modern scientists are very worried about ecological situation in the world. In order to save our planet many organizations try to control air pollution by different methods. In this case, it is important to use the power of government for helping our Earth. If governments introduce special laws, it will support ecological organizations in fighting with pollution and global warming very much.

Moreover, the main goal of the government is to care about people. In this case, it is try to make everything to provide more pure atmosphere and clean air. This changes will positively influence on the level of health and amount of births.

Finally, controlling the traffic of planes by government will show people the real situation in worldwide ecology system. Everyone will understand that this problem went to a new level – level of the President. It will motivate people to be more careful: keep the air clean and do not make streets dirty.

To conclude, air pollution and global warming is one of the main issues of a modern society. In order to save the ecological situation governments should try any methods include introducing special laws for air-companies.

How can this problem be solved? A lot of people seem to think, that increasing the amount of sport facilities will benefit for the society. However, there are some people who doupt that these measures will have a great effect. Is it reasonable to build more sport facilities?
In my opinion, it will not solve the problem of public health. To begin with, whether or not the person will do sports entirely depends on him. If he is willing to do so, he will find a way to be more healthy, even if there do not exist any sport facilities. The opposite is true, too: if someone does not want to change his lifestyle, he will not do it, even if ne is living in the sports facility. Another thing we should not forget is that the public health is not only about sports, but about medicine as well. Even the greatest sportsmen in the world are not preserved from: ilnesses and injures. Without an effective medicine, it would be highly improbable to cure them. Therefore, I think that this is the area we should invest into. 
However, some people may argue that increasing the number of swimming pools, stadiums and other sport facilities will surely help people to overcome their laziness and start thinking about their health. They claim that this will also increase the interest in sport amoung the young people, like it was in China, and, in the end, the average person will be healthier. This people often forget, that in order to be healthier you must do sports regularly, and in our modern time people are very busy with their jobs and families. The addition of new sport facilities will not solve the problem of the shortage of time, and people will not spend more time in gyms because of their increased amount.
To sum up, increasing the amount of sport facilities will give more possibilities to do sports, but I am sure that being healthy is not always about sports. It is also about healthy food, good medicine and determination to change your life for the letter.

Both parents spend time together with kids not as much as they used to. There are several reasons which can cause this and some troubles that can appear in this situation. To begin with, career is the main obstack to spend enough time with family. In present-day world, people desire to achieve a great success, find a well-paid job and get the highest position in companies. And if they did not manage to do this earlier, before family life, they try to achieve this when they already have children. So grandmothers and grandfathers, babysitters became main people who brings up babies. In addition, lifestyle affects patterns of care and attention. In the past, children started working in very early age. They quite often go to work on fields or gardens with their family. Nowadays this can be observed in poor countries, but in developed ones parents are the only family members who have to go to job. Considering the problems that can be caused, getting into trouble can me named as the main issue. When a child, especially an adolescent, sees that parent do not care about his life he decided that it is allowed to do whatever he wants. Teenagers join bad companies and their new friends quite often have some bad habits such as drugs or alcohol. Moreover, lack of parent’s attention influences on school marks of a child. Helping in learning process and participating in school life are the essential part of parenting. The way how adults bring up their children affects on their attitude to education. To sum up, help to find a proper way in further life it is significant duty of parents and it is quite important to spend enough time with children to protect them from any troubles.

There is two sides of this problem. Let is start with point where I agree with statement that people who copying films in the cinema and then download it in different sites like torrent where you can save it on your computer for free should be punished. Of course, it is bad for producers, singers and for group that cover the music, do some effects and etc. They started this business to get money but when you download it for free they lose them. The same situation if you work hard on your job and someone come to you and steal your money. Overall, if you be punished you have to pay some big amount or go to prison.
On the other side people who “theft” music and films help everyone. Not everyone has money, they do not allow themselves to go to the cinema or buy discs with music. As for me, it really helps. I have special app on my phone where I can downlod the music. Pay nothing or pay 1000 rubles per month. If you skiped the movie that you really wanted to see, you will not go to the shop and buy disc you will ask your friend or you can do it by yourself and download it on computer

Firstly, some people claim that it is effective to bann sportsmen from competing for their entire life. Secondly, others think it is unnessecary and it would be more convinient to limit this time to several years only. This essay discuss both opinions and give the most balanced solution for the situation.
On the one hand, it is easier to refuse athletes to participate in any sort of professional competitions for the rest of their lives, because there is no need to focus on the details of the each case and the amount of illegal drugs, which were used. Due to this fact, jures do not have to collect the whole information about the athlete and can make a decision far more faster, because they would have precident in their practice. In addition, it tends to be way more honest to give the same arest for each sportsman. As far as I am concerned, this opinion is rather stricktly and the soft power is more productive in this field.
On the other hand, the athletes need to recognize their mistake and to inculcate virtues and the professional ethics they have to be banned for some period of time. Furthermore, the carreer in this sphere is complex and people, who choose it practically always do only training activities for their whole life, so they have no time to get another qualification and higher education. To my mind, it is the most proper way to regulate such illegal doings.
In conclusion, there is no the only right way to solve the problem of using illegal drugs in sports field, but I stress the opinion that people from this sphere should have an opportunity to continue their career in any case after the period of time.

It is no doubt, that students should have equal opportunities to study every subject. Every person is individual and everyone has special skills. But usually some subjects, spheres and direction have no similar popularity between boys and girls. For instance, some subjects is needed in enormous force such as building or some technique specialization, engeneering. Obviously, girls are able to take knowledge about this subjects but they cannot to work and use their knowledge in practice. So their studing and education are useless , aren't they? University should not tell ""You must study here because you are a male or female"", they should give us chance to make a choice , choose a right direction and make a decision. If universities give equal access to different direction for women and men they can choose so we get modern society with develop professions where every person do work which can be done by their individual skills.

The most evident point is that there are three leaders: Paris, London and Tokyo as their indicators are much more considerable compared to three others.
Thus it can be noticed that by the very beginning of the XX century London, Paris and Tokyo had had underground railway systems, whereas the rest of the cities opened it only by the end of the century. A stark feature is that London system was prolonged to 394 kilometres, which is two times more than the length of system in Paris, which route has the biggest amount of kilometres among others. the same about passangers per year as the figure of 1927 related to Tokyo is much more impressive than others.

The issue of growing number of crimes is widely discussed. Some people see the solution of this problem in making the sentences in prisons longer, whereas others argue that there should be more effective means to solve this question. To begin with, some people think that the restriction of the punishment by rising the length of sentence could be frightening for those who are up to make a crime. For instance, there is a serious difference between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment. Moreover, a longer stay under arrest provides government workers with more time for improving the imprisoned ones. Finally, if a person is placed in prison for many years it could prevent him from repeating the crime soon. However, some claim that this means is not enough and that more wide variety of solutions should be considered. Firstly, the social environment must be made more friendly for all people. Secondly, the work of policemen must be put under a careful observation as there are a lot of cases when police helped drug dealers, robbers and etc. Thirdly, the help of specialists such as scientists should not be neglected while solving an issue like this. To sum up, nowadays there is still no alliance between both sides in the question of fighting with crimes and both ways of solving the issue of high crime rates have their benefits and drawbacks. Hopefully, in the future there will be found an effective way to use the argumends of two groups for improving the crime situation. ",65,2,2

People consider that governments should introduce laws that can be reduced the myriad of air travel for business or leisure. Let consider is it right statement or not.
Undoubtedly, we are face to face with a big problem because if a lot of air travel, that conributes global warming and air pollution, is unnecessary and we are just wasting it, goverments will have find solution of it. Almost a half of population supposes that it has to be not a good decision reducing the amount of air travel for business. I have the same opinion as people will want to make a lot of money on it and it will be a struggle for success.
Moreover, it can take a lot of time and money for introducing laws because it is a long process even for goverments. Every days they make some laws for solution of some problems and only a part of it has been introduced. It is also a great risk for society as business leads to some dangerous situations between people. For instance, every year we are trying to have a good relationship with other countries. If air travel reduces for leisure or business, all countries will fight with each other and we will get a lot of enemies because people always desires to make the best situations for their country.

The forecast shows, however, a significant decrease in print books profit, which is from 10,5 to 7,5 billion, and a dramatic rise in eBook saling to tremendous 8,5 billion. Turning to Germany, its benefit from print in 2014 was 6 billion dollars, whilst eBook revenue consisted a tiny 1 billion. Despite this amount not being great, forecast tells that it will change to 1,5 billion in 2018. As for print, it is believed to remain stable.

In many country the legislatures propose a laws about punishment for this, but in the world didn’t exist some consencas about that. and this question is very discussing.
The first part of peoples says that punishment is necessory for pirates. First of all, they argument that every work must have the salary, and the biggest part of tists salary is the sum of money that they gained when someone buying his product. Logically, that if nobody wouldn’t to buy the original because he prefer to download the film or music for free, then artists will haven’t motivation to create more, because his work can’t give them a money. As a result, the industry of art to losing not only a money, but what more important, a talents who want to do genius creation and gain money for that.
Also, other part exist too. Some peoples sures, that the punishment for sharing music or films for free is terrible idea! Firstly, they argue, that art should be free because everyone must have an access for all creations of art, for have more possibilities to developp. but not all peoples can buy every song, for example, that pretty for him, it’s too expensive, and this man or woman may haven’t a money for that. Secondly, when someone would to buy something, it necessary to know the quality of this creation and often peoples haven’t some possibility to check it. For example, a music. One can’t understand is it satisfy one’s needs while hearing, but it impossible to hear it when buying. When pirates exists it possible to find concret song in Internet and heare before buying and then one know is it necessary to buy it. The same situation with films. Trailer of film can’t give the information about real quality of product, and when someone can watch the part of film in Internet, then he or she will go to the cinema to watch it in the high denition, or buy blue-ray disk.
Finally, personally I think, that pirate copies have many advantages and it really bad to punish for that, because sometimes it can’t provide to money loses for creator.

On the one hand, from the widespread statistic data the, majority of women have better marks in school than men, they are more occurate and hard-working. In this case women will study in the universities better than men and become more professional. In addition the situation when there are the equal numbers of men and women in the class is more appropriate as in this case students will socialize better, become friends with each other and know each other in difficult situations.
On the other hand, some faculties as engeneering or physics have low woman's demand as it is very hard to study there. As a result, the universities can not accept equal numbers of male and female students on these faculties, because women don't want to go there. Moreover , there is an opinion that it is better for girl not to choose hard profession as she should stay home , cook food and etc.

There is no doubt that freedom helps thoughts to fly. But I do not think  that this freedom should not be restricted, because everything has nits own limits. Iv the artist feels free, it doese not mean that there qare no things and actions that are prohibited. Moreover, such thoughts may be dangerous as for a person, who shares this idea, as for people around him or her. For example, there is one russian actor, who has already showed distructive behaviour. He also has injured some people. Giving people an action freedom is too dangerous for society. It is also kniwn that some artists begin to take drugs hen they have a crisis. Who can predict whatnwill happen around them while they being affected? Nobody knows. 
From my point of view, being restricted by somebody or something is the way of becoming better as an artist. If you can create something while being in an empty room, you are a genius. It does not matter who restricts you, but if you can bring your masterpiece to the diamond despite all the difficulties it means you wil improve your skills during the whole life. 
Creating something is a difficult way to understand who you are and what you can do. Feeling free helps to identify your personality but we should not forget that sometimes it can be very dangerous foir thise who surround us. Do not avoid restrictins that is the key to success.

From my point of view, there is another important function of these media and in my essay I will support this idea with examples. First, Facebook and Vkontakte contain several web groups where schoolers and students can find useful files and videos for education. Practically every university has an official group in media which is usually employed not only for announcement of events, but also for uploading tutorials and lectures made by professors of this university. The Higher School of Economics, as an example, has an Internet project  “Open leactures” based on Vkontakte. Another important function could be an opportunity for groups of intuests and tastes. In such platforms people can share relevant information on particular subject and do projects involving other members of group. For instance, there are numerous of political groups where members of a political parties and covrlans con communicate and discuss current issues. On other hands, social networks are a global chance to find people with the same view point and collaboratw with them. On the other hand, the influence of Facebook and Vkontakte is designed exactrly for entertainment. They are great media platforms there you can listen to music, watch films, play games and even read books. As an example, when Russian government imposed new form against playraning and the most fact of films and music disappeared from these social networks, the huge of them rapidly dived. All things concluded, social media can be used both for enjoying in the free time and learning new things. Personally, I believe that there websites are an attractive educational fact.

When people congratulate someone, it is quite common to wish happiness. But what do we mean by "" happiness""? What things can make a person happy?
It rather difficult to give happiness a strict definition. In fact it is hardly possible. The reason is that this concept is very subjective and it can be said that everyone has different things which can cause happiness. Also the problem is that happiness is a state of mind, it has psychological features, which make the definition even more complicated for the person who is not a specialist. 
Although it us hard to define happiness, some factors which can make people happy can be pointed out. In my opinion, first thing is love. As the Beatles sang ""Love is all you need"".  When a person fals in love, his or her mood becomes much better, everything seems great and easy. Family and friends are also very important. Is is widely known that it is easier to become depressed if you do not have strong personal relationships. 
One more thing is professional succes. If people go to work which they don't like, they are likely to be unhappy. And of course it is important to get satisfaction from the job. 
Also hobbies and art can make people enjoy their lives and become happy. Art often becomes a sense of life for people, they feel happy only if they create something. 
To summarise it can be said that different people have different things which make them happy. Some people look for somebody to love, others are in love with their jobs.

Every human want to be happy I suppose. But every person gives his or her own meaning of and there can be a huge number of factors our happiness depends on.
As for me, I would like to refer to a well-known phrase from a soviet movie: “happiness it is a situation when you are understood”. As human is not only biological creature but a social one, we can not underestimate the significance of communication and being understood and loved.
Nevertheless it is not a single possible reason. A lot of people in modern society warrying about their everyday  needs and just want to have enough money and to be healthy. In Russia there is an opinion that health is the main thing in the life and all other points will be achieved if you are healthy.

There are different opinion about the measures for this. This essay will discuss these opinions and make a certain conclusion.
To begin with, some people argue that if athlete use any illegal drug he must be banned from competition only for a period of several years. Indeed, it might be a viable solution, because every one has the right to make a mistake, so if the athlete has a time, he will understand that he was wrong at his desicion and then he will train more and more to avoid the using of such drugs in the following competition. The obvious advantage of this solution is that the sportsman should not stop his career, which might be the central part of his life.
From the other side, there is an opinion that the athletes used illegal drugs must be banned from the professional sport forever. It has no deny that such decision may be rather strict and cruel, but I can definitely agree with it. Sport is not just about always being first; it teaches to strive some strict moral codex and being honour with yourself. It is easiest way to use drugs to improve your skills for a period, but it also shows the soul weakness. In this case how can such person call himself a truly sportsmen?
Despite there being a lot of debates about the opportunity of using any drugs in order to increase sport skills, sportsmen should stay carefull, because such measures might destroy their health. It is true for any kind of drugs: legal or illegal. As for the latter, I strongly believe that its using by professional sportsmen is the worse way to gain success. That is why it might be necessary to banned such sportsmen from competing not only for 2 or 3 years, but for the rest of life.

Overall, the two most striking trends are that men spent more time for doing exercises than women and the total amount of minutes decline through the elder stages of life. It is can be clearly stated from the chart that men spend generally more time doing sports than women are. The biggest gap in the time spent in such a way as gender is seen in the age group of 16-24 years old people with men prevailing women more than two times. This trend is smoothing with the further age groups with group of 55-64 years old as an exception with women spending 3 minutes more than men. Another feature observed is that throughout a person’s life cycle with no response to gender there is a declining trend in minutes spent for sports. Started with 282,1 minutes for men and 114,1 for women the chart ends with approximately ten-times drop in numbers among both groups. To conclude, as it can be observed from the chart under question in 2012 in England men generally spent more time doing sports than women and with age both groups tend to reduce this kind of time spending.

There are a lot of supporters of the idea that improving sport facilities can lead to an increasing level of general health of the population. Whereas others incline that such an improvement will not change anything and we need to think over other measures to solve the problem of low level of health.


From my point of view, developing sport facilities in the country undoubtedly can make things better. Firstly, sport activities stimulates blood circulation. So that people, who will use the opportunity to go in for sports will reduce the risk of heart deseases significantly.  What is more, physical activity can present body from fast ageing. That means that people can live longer and can be healthy, when they are already rather old. It can lead to the decline in the level of mortality in the country and as a result that will increase its well-being.


On the other hand, a great part of people think that there is no sense to invest money in sport and incline that there are more considerable problems, that need money to be developed. The point in favour of this position is that finding cure against serious deseases is much more important. Investing money in this sphere is a fight against the real problem, but not the attempt to prevent potential problems.


Furthermore, more effective measure to improve the health level of population can be vacination. Deseases canbe prevented in such way but people are sometimes not enough aware of benefits of vacination and ignore it. Sport can help in such causes, but medical measures can.


All things considered, it is only for government to decide what measures to introduce in order to rise the level of health, but in my opinion it will be better probably to co-operate both medicinal and sport improving measures.

There are many new ways of committing the crimes, for example, using credit cards ot the Internet. There are two solutions of this problem which are discussed now: long prison sentences and other ways of punishment. Both suggestions have their advantages and disadvantages.
People who support the idea of long prison sentenses believe that it might prevent the crimes. If a person knows that they would be imprisoned for a long time for something illegal, they might not commit the crime at all frightened of the circumstances. Moreover, the work and regime there can, actually, make a person better because the idea of the prison is to teach the prisoner how to survive in real life without committing the crimes.
However, people who stay against long prison sentenses explain that there are lot of much more effective ways to have an influence on the criminal. First of all, big fines can be very useful in this situation because nobody would like to lose their money. In addition, work in the community services can also help a person to understand the value of usual way of earning money.
I think that the second position is more effective because, unfortunately, prisons do not usually work the way they should. The prisoners are usually destroyed there by the hard work and the attitude to them from the administration of the prison.

All people is sure that it must be punished, however, they have different opinion about the punishment itself. While some people is sure that professional sportsmen who use illegal drugs have to be banned from the competitions for a several years (about 2), others believe that it is necessary to banned them forever. In my essay the arguments of both sides will be discussed carefully and I will give my own point of view.
To begin with, it should be noted that athletes spend all their time for sport and it usually means that they cannot work in another sphere. Hence, if we cancel them to take part in competitions for the rest of their lives, we may make their lives useless. In addition, all people tend to make some mistakes during their lives, consequently, it is not right not to give them a chance to improve the situation. Therefore, Although it might be true to say that being a professional spontsman is too responsiable (especially if we talk about international competitions), it does not necessary mean that athletes have to be punished for so long time.
Nevertheless, any balanced essay ought to take into account another point of view. Many people can argue that all athletes knew about possiable result before they use illegal drugs, hence, they must be fully responsiable for their choise. Provided that the illegal usage of drugs is proved carefully, sportsmen have to be banned from competitions as well as lose their professional status. In addition, less strict rules is able to cause problems again after the two-year period.
To conclude, the issue connected with illegal usage of drugs by athletes provokes heated debates and both sides have strong arguments. Much as I agree with people, who wanted athletes to be banned forever, I also understand that it cannot overcome the problem at all, and it might be too serious penalty because all people have a right to make mistakes.

This is highly productive way for making business, and to my mind, this is very beneficial for both sides of the world process. In my opinion, there are more good points in using labor of local workers than disadvantages. First of all, the level of living in poorer countries is significantly lower than that of rich  countries. That is why such countries suffer from the lack of the job. But these corporations provide these workers with it. Secondly, corporations, such as, Apple decrease their expenditure on the salary and may spend more money on developing some innovative products, rather than satisfy the needs for workers. And finally, huge, unpleasant and hazardous factories don’t spoil the appearance pf the cities where the main offices of the corporations are located because the factories are in poorer countries.

Also, some people say that the rewards are distributed unfairly and the salaries are too low in those developing countries.

Personal charactiristics transform as a consequence of every-day experience.
Second, out personal characteristics remain in our private life. In the social life we should hide our true thoughts and, may be, preferences, because a lot of surroundings factors influence on us. Different social norms control our behavior and we become regardless to our personality. We recognise these rules and norms behavior in result of our experience in the life.

At the same time the usage of deskop verson decreased in March 2013 (approximately 140 millions of users). In March 2012 deskop version was used by approximately 150 millions of users. Second chart gives an information about reasons of using Facebook among men and women. As we can see, mostly all people think that the use Facebook because of sharing photos|videos (54% of women and 39% of men). The second and third reasons differ between men and women. As the second most popular reason 43% of women suppose that it is seeing funny posts, 38% of men think that it is receiving updates. As the third popular reason 39% of women choose receiving updates and 35% of men choose seeing funny posts.

However, the African region remains to have the highest number of children without access to primary school education. The most significant reduction is shown by South Asia, the amount of boys and girls without opportunity to learn at primary school decreased more than threefold, from around 33 millions in 2000 to approximately 10 millions in 2012. In 2000 the rest of world had the lowest amount of children without primary school education, but although there was a fall, by 2012 it had lost its position and South Asia had the smallest number of those boys and girls.

And this is a huge problem as current young generation is the generation which will set the motion of the nation in a few years. How can a man who stole a snack from a shop become a fair politician? This question makes us think about the crimes committed by young generation. To tackle this problem, we need to find the reasons why do children commit crimes and then to find the ways parents and teachers can affect these reasons.
From my point of view, there are 2 main reasons for crimes committed by young people. The first reason is the distance between a child and his parents. Adults pay a lot of attention to their career and they do not allocate much time for their kids and do not teach them about good things and bad things. The second reason is that kids spend a lot of time surfing the web and sometimes they may visit websites with bad content which put positive spin on crimes, and incentivize them commit crimes.
To solve the problem of crime, we need to focus on these 2 reasons and take 2 simple steps. As a first step should spend more time with their kids and to them about good things and tell bad things. Besides parents, teachers should do the same at schools. As a second step, parents should protect kids from bad information in the internet by installing special programs on the laptops. These actions will protect kids from bad incentives to comit crimes and will help them understand what a crime is.
We found out 2 reasons for kids crime: bad information on the web + lack of understanding good and bad things. To tackle the problem of kids crime, we need to control their internet surfing and allocate more time to them.
By taking 2 steps described above, we could prevent kids from comiting crimes.

It is a theft or not? I think, that it is not always right.

From one point of viwe it will be too expensiv to buy always the original discs. Not all of us have enogh money for it. For example my friends can not pay 300 or more rubles for each film, that they want to watch. Sometimes we need it not only for fun, but for instance for our stady. As a result people, who can non pay, use the Internet and download all which they need for free, but I don’t think, that they should be punished for it.

From the other point of viwe, it is imposible to produse something, when you do not become money for it. A lot of producers use money, that they become from one film or music disc for producing of something new. I think, that when you realy like something, you should support people, who did it. For example, I buy discs of my favorit music groups, because I want to help them become some money for their work. I’m sure, that they realy need it and, when I have responsibility to do something for them I will do it.

In conclusion I will say, that everybody must choose himself to pay or not to pay for music and films. I decided to support film and music makers.

Few would despute the fact that travelling by plane is the most conviniet way to get to another place, although it produces an outstanding amount of gases. Whether the government should make any steps in order to decrease the number of air travel is a controversial topic worth discussing.

On one side, many people are of the opinoin that the government itself should step in and provide us with some law, which would reduce the amount of air travel. To begin with, it would be better for everyone to have a legal, strict directions about, how and when one person can fly, as it would make an impact on greenhouse gases and global warming. In addition, it would not confuse anyone or create arguments about, who's turn it is to take a flight, because people could just see the legitimate document, providing them with needed information. Moreover, this law could be useful for government could as well, since it would have a better control over the income of the all airline companies.

On the other side, there is the view that the laws that the government would introduce might not help the contemporary situation. Firstly, these laws would interfeare with people's personal life, thus causing arguments and controvercies. Secondly, government might overtake the whole air traveling sector and organise a monopoly on air travel. And thirdly, so far there is no possible way that kind of law could be introduced properly and accepted by the public.

In conclusion, it is obvious that air travelling laws is a very provocative topic. But personally, I believe that some laws that would have and effect on the decrease of polition are needed. Therefore, I would advice for the government to make airline companies turn to natural resources and use environmentalfriendly fuel.",65,2,1

In my opinion it is really good decision to provide equal numbers of students of difrent sexes in different disciplines. 

There are some reasons, why I think it is useful and even important to support this point of view. First of all this idea is actual because it supports the human rights which give us freedom to choose our path in different parts of life, for example, we are free to choose what discipline we want to learn independable on our sex. It means that boys are able to choose technical subjects nor only because they are boys and it means that girls will not look silly in the technical or math’s classes only because they are girls. 
The second reason I think this point of view should supported is a possibility of appearing amount of famous researchers and scientists in different disciplines where male personse were in majority. For example  Mari – Pierre Quirry became a great physician, but it was considered , that women should not learn such sciense as physics or maths; so Mari remain the only famous women who made a breakthrough in physics. According to the topic of this work we are able to discover a lot of talented woman in such disciplines as physics and maths so it can become an impact to new scientific revolution. 
To sum it up I can say that idea of equal number of male and female students in different subject can be significant in further development of different branches of science and it would become useful for a whole humanity.

Personally I have grown up on American animation. That is why in the little age I already knew who scouts are, what marshemellow is, some parts of American history and culture. People like me from different countries all over the world are one of the evidences that British and American film industry has a huge popularity. What are reasons for this?
Firstly, English is an international language and, talking about foreign films, people in many countries can watch films in English, but not in Chinese or in Russian.
Secondly, I do not really know what is wrong with filmaking in my country, but it is more likely to find great and deep American or British film than Russian one. If some Russian film is really good, that is always because of the plot and some message, not because of visual effects. An impressive visual part is one of the reasons of American and British films' popularity.
Although, I do not think that the matter is in financial support. Many Russian films had great support from government, and that didn't help at all. Sometimes people who make films in Russia just take these money from government for their own needs, and their films appear to be awful. In contrary, there are a lot of awesome films made with no government support at all.
All in all, locally produced films also can be great masterpieces. What about financial support, there should be fair competition for getting it, and in this case it can be useful.",65,2,2

In modern world quite a lot of big companies open their producing centers in developing countries and enhance local people as workers. And at the time when enterprises take good advantages from it, I must say that their profits are not as important as problems cause by this policy, and in my essay below I’ll try to prove it. First of all I should say that when some companies opens its factories in areas where people never used to meet modern ways of manufacturing, this interrupt their lifestyle and pace of life, so local people become more stressed at the same time as their believes also get endangered, because different producing types have their basis in different values, so managers try to change local employees view of life. It is the same as people who work in fields can not understand urban people and rice versa. On the other hand, enterprises do not only have a great profit from cheap local workers and create new jobs, but though the fiscal system supply government with money so they can improve social services. But as for me, it’s only western type of thinking that government should help and control us, we do not have to force other nations. All in all, in this essay I described some advantages and disadvantages of enterprises open their business in other countries at the time when there are different pluses of this. I believe that other positions being disturbed is much more important problem comparing to the profits.

The first and most obvious trend shown at yhe graph is that the consumption of the electricity in summer is much less than in the winter. There can be seen similar trends in both seasons - a smooth fall from approximately 3 hours to 9 hours i the morning, then rocketing for more than 10000 units. The summer graph reaches a peak at 14 hours and then smoothly fluctuates and goes at the bottom of 15000 units at 24 hours. the winter graph hits a peek at 48000 units at 22 hours and then plummets down to 3200 units at 24 hours, almost lowest point.
talking about differences more closely, we can see that because of the abscence of the main energy-demanding need, central heating, the summer trend does not rise above the figure of 20000 units of electricity. comparing it with the energy demand off the winter, we can simply calculate thet heating takes approximately 20000 units of electricity. Some other risings and little differences are the expences of the cold, people need more heat to feel themselves comfortable.
To draw up a conclusion, I wouldsay that because of the low temperatures and less vitamins in winter. People hace to heat their flats, eat more and have more hot drinks than in summer.

Another intresting fact: in younger age groups Facebook is more popular than in older ones.

It can be done in many ways: taking part in different sport competitions, eating healthy and so on. But can doing sports regularly really improve public health or not? Let us discuss the problem.
Nowadays many people in many cities, towns and country-sides start thinking about their health and numbrous ways to improve it. Some say that if we increase the amount of sport facilities, such a problem will vanish. Well, it is right in some way. For instance, many people are too busy to spend long hours to get to any kind of fitness clubs. It means that if the general number of those clubs rise, people will probably visit them more often. Secondly, some people can't afford visiting a fitness clubs due to their high costs. Nevertheless, some sport facilities could be built right in the street, where such people will use them for no charge.
On the other hand, building expensive sport facilities doesn't mean that people will use it. Today people are becoming more and more lazy due to the significant technology improvements, that make our life easier. it means that even if any kind of sport facilities is installed, it is only for people to decide, wheather to use them or not. Such installments are also often vandalised by teenagers, that makes their building pointless from the very beginning.
To sum it up, I would like to say that I do not find the strategy of increasing the amount of sport facilities useful for the modern world. If people really care about their health, they will find all ways to improve it.

Starting learning foreign languages being a child has quite a large number of advantages. Firstly, at primary school children are more open to new information than when they grow up. Really, the older we get, the more difficult it appears to us to learn something new. Secondly, having got basic skills in learning languages at primary school allows people to learn other language faster in future. Moreover, knowing a foreign language at primary school allows to make friends all over the world in some international summer camps, or simply not to get lost in a foreign country while being on holiday with parents.
However, there are aslo some relevant drawbacks. Many people say that it is too difficult to begin to study foreign language when you don’t even know how to use properly your mother tongue. They say that children should be firstly taught to read and to write in their own language without making mistakes. Actually, it is sometimes too hard for small children to digest the enormous amounts of new information they get at school. 
To sum it up, I would like to say that in my opinion the advantages of starting to learn a foreign language at primary school overweigh the disadvantages. This could be really useful for the future studies.

One of the ideas, which is suggested is a system called ""Guaranteed Basic Income"". The idea of this system is that there is a monthly payment for people even if they get salary. Now I would like to elaborate on this topic and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this system.
On one hand, there is a real help for people, who have a lack of money, whatever problem causes this situation. I suppose, it is important to help people, who can not afford buying even some basic and essential things. For example, there are families with many children, who need to be feed and have clothes to wear but their income is not high enough. What is more, disabled person can not work well because of his or her disability but he or she still needs to buy food, medicines and some other stuff.
On the other hand, many people can be so lazy, that they will be happy to have small amount of money, but to be able to stay at home and do nothing. In my view, this can be not only bad for the person, who prefers this lifestyle, but also for the whole society.
To sum up, the system ""Guaranteed Basic Income"" is controversial because of the question, if everyone really deserves this monthly payment. In my oppinion, there should be more details about this system, which allow to pay money not for everyone, because sometimes it can become a waste of money for government.",65,2,3

TASK 1.
The charts from the writing task 1 show data about the population of Yemen and Italy deviding on tree aged groups in 2000 and 50 years more in the future.
Compare charts of Yemen in 2050 and 50 years previous, it seems to be an increase in group aged 15-59 years from 46,3% to 57,3% and in group 60 and more up to 5,7% from 3.6%. The former people aged 0-14 years was a half of population, but the latter it will be only 37%.
Italy's charts describe a decrease among people older than 15 up to 59 in 15-20% to be precise, but an increase from 24.1% to 42,3% amond the oldest group.
To sum up, by 2050 both countries will have older population compared with 2000. There will be a decrease among children for both Italy and Yemen, The top group will be at the age of 15-59 years old. Italy will have more than 40% of people above 60 years. We see that less people will be born in Italy and Yemen.

What is more, some serious crimes become more common every year.
The major issue, which is drastically changing our world, is that those crimes are often committed by youngsters. Nothing emerges from nothing, therefore there are certain causes of such a demeanor.

To my mind, one of the main things that cause teenagers to make dire mistakes of committing a crime is a lack or just bad parenting. Sometimes parents remain the main reason of child's wrong behavior. Thus, in my opinion, to solve a problem like this our government should make compulsory parenting courses for people who are thinking of starting a family. This decision should be well thought through and consciously made.
The second cause of young people committing crimes may be the absence of information of what follows after it. It would be great if teachers at schools could give students lectures concerning the punishment that the crime is followed by. Not only will it discourage students from doing something stupid, but also it will make them more educated in terms of law, which is a brilliant bonus.

Last but not least is the one that mainly affects the psychological aspect. Sometimes young people could act like this because of how little attention they are given. I suppose, that the solution would be for teachers and parents to support them and show that they are surrounded by people who love, need and care about them.

If the government, parents and teachers all together take action as soon as possible the situation may be slowed down or even stopped. Such issues that young people are involved in should always be raised and solved fast as long as it is not that dramatic.",70,2,1

I don’t think so, to speak frankly. 
First of all, some subject some subjects are not popular for males or females. I mean spheres are so different now to be studied by all of people. As a rule, driver is likely to be a male profession, but a teacher is usualy a female ; that is why it would be hard to attend such classes without interest, it wouldn’t be popular just because of sex. What is more, it is not nesessary to my mind, I believe males would be more succesful doing “male work”, but not attending classes to study the way to do “female work”; that society make you obey.
One more option is the way people think: men and women have different logic and method to overcome problems and to do work well. Females are always too emotional, that is why subjects concerning stress is not for them.
What is more, to enter the university person have to pass special exams, and those who has a greater point is to be given a chance to study in university. Obviously, it is impossible to have the same results between males and females to have equal entering chance, that is why groups form without paying attention on sex (just exams results).

An artist without freedom is said not to be able to create anything. Artist should have a right to express his own identity in his works. Art should not be framed, otherwise there is a possibility that a talented person couldn’t produce a masterpiece, which would mean a great loose for the society, for the culture.

It is very clear that those people, who are making the products are losing money from this, but in my opinion I will likely disagree whith this statement and punishment.
First of all, to fight with thefts we need to punish not only the ones who are downloading this from the internet, rather than punish those who are copying and after this spreading and sharing those materials illegally, because those people are most likely cominiting the crime, not the other ones who are just taking the maximum from a free-place like an internet.
Secondly, most of a times the main process of selling those products not the right one. Main argument against modern system is about not having a chanse to overwiev the material which we are bying. If you go to watch a film or to listen some music discs you must to pay for it before you will get access to overwiev it, when, in my opinion it is not very pleasant, because you are paying for a product, when it can appear as a low-quality one or which will not satisfy yourself.
Therefore, in my opinion this process may be more pleasant in a way, when firstly you can download it for-free and if you satisfied with a product you can fund any amount of money to a content-maker. However with the discs it is obvious that we must to pay for it, because that is touchable product with spended money on them. But mostly it depend on the people’s awareness of product price, if they are aware, the money will come to producers.

The problem of ways to increase it is extremely essential for every governments. There are people who believe that it may be done by increasing the number of sports facilities, but there are some who argue that it will be not very effective solution. I suppose that it is a good idea. It will make the sport more available, but on the other hand, we also need a some kind of promotion of sport.
There are many people who would like to going for sports, but have no facilities neare their houses for doing it. This problem can be solved by building new sport areas such as fitness clubs, swimming pulls, dance classes and others. It will give an opportunity to many people to become healthier. 
This way to solve the problem can be not very effective because there are also people who do not like sport. That is why we need to make an additional actions to describe them why it is useful to be interested in some kind of sports. One of ways to do this is a social advertasing. Also, we can use some celebrities to show that sport is extremly popular in our days. Such essential part of social life as halth should be always controlled by the government. It must act in two directions: to provide us with the needed facilities and to promote health life style and sports.

Air travel is more fast transport that prefer a lot of people. You can reach your country in several hours instad of several days. By the way, planes are the most safely transport in the world. As for me, I will choose air travel, because I like to travel fast and without problems. Besides it, cars are the most dirty type of transport and it is not correct to say that planes gives more pollution. Firstly, because the amount of cars are higher than the amount of air planes.In addition the number of different other transport also increase than number of planes. Bu the way, air travelling is not very cheap variant to travel for people. I will say that, for example, for me it is reach type of transport.Not every person can allow himself air travel. Because of it, man use cars, busses and other possible variants in order not to pay so much money.

Secondly, I do not understand why governments want to decrease number of air travel, if this type of travelling is popular not in every social group. Planes are used by reach people and they can not imagine theit lifes without this transport. They have many bisiness meetings in witch they have to resolve differt problems, may be world problems.In my belief that governments will not introduve laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I think it is not rational way, because of it can decrease the economical situation in the world, because business men will not be able in rapid time to resolve their business works and development will stops.

In conclution, I want to say that air travelling is the most quckly and comfortable way to travel and will not be correct to decrease the number of planes. Many people will not understand this decision. There are many others more dirty and giving pollition transpots than planes.",60,2,4

One people believe that the increasing the number of sport facilities is the best way to improve public health. Other people sure that it will be not effective for improve ealth of population. Whos point of view is right?


On the one hand, it known, tht sport activities make human strong and happy. Moreover, when person happy, he feels himself mach more better than other people. Then, when people has an everyday middle activity. They save and improve their health. Moreover, visiting the gym or other facilities is the contrast to spend time in the Internet. It has much more benefits for human. And last, but not least, sportsmen's eat only health food. And due to this reason their health level much more better then level of other people.


On the other hand, when human give the biggest part of his life to sport, in the old ages he has a lot of problems with health. Second part of people sure that the best way to improve public health is by developing health care service. Government should open more heath care organisation to solve problem of less level of public health.


In my opinion, the level of people's health can be increased by opening new sports facilities. I'm sure that only people who spend their time to sport activities can be health persons in our modern, indastry world.


To sum up, after analising both points of view, I agree with. The first part of population, but other people have good ideas how to improve public health by government helps.

Moreover, metals are the goods which were transported in the bigger amount that other things by rail (35%). What is more, food products traveled from one destination to another by road more often than other goods.

A closer look at the graph reveals that the percentage of non-metallic minerals and chemicals which were transported by road is practically the same (13% and 16% respectively). Futhermore, there is a great difference between the amount of machinery carried two different ways. 12% were transported by rail and drastically less by road hitting only 2%.

Although many people prefere to copy or to share music and films on the internet instead of buying its, the cost of this has to be considered first.
Many people support the opinion that it is very bad situation, that all people have a free access for different sources in the internet. Firstly, musicians and film producers, who make efforts for to do music or film, should get the goods for its works. It could be illustrated by the following example: a producer make a film and he wish he is respected and he want to have money for his hurt job, but people don’t want to buy the disc with his film, they copying it on the internet. As the result a producer lose money. Secondly, producing and making music are the work and its work is same as other jobs. For instance, if an economist or people, who seat the governmental office have the goods for jobs, musicians, producers artist should also get money.
However, some people think that it is normally situation in the modern life and musicians and film producers should understand, that they can’t evide loosing goods. Moreover, it isn’t right to punish such people because they act rationally, when they don’t want to buy for free music and films.
Having considered both sides of this debate, it can be concluded that it is spead situation in the modern world, when people share or copy films or music, but we should think about musicians and film producers, who lose huge money and we should solve this issue. Personally I would agree with the idea that we should destroy the process of making illegal pirate copies, because it make a harm for people, who make the art and want to get money and respect for efforts.

So, we have two opinions here. The first thought is a little strange. Nowadays we have a lot of very comfortable and cool prisons. There people have a good meals, rooms, libraries. They can do sports in gyms and so on. It is very popular type of prisons in European countries. So, I do not think that the longer prison sentences is the best way for crime reducing.
Maybe in some other prisons, for example, in Russia this way is better, but not is the modern prisons. In the Internet there are some photos from Sweden prison. It is something like hotel. So strange.
But there are the other opinion about this problem.Some people give other alternative ways of reducing crime. For example, some works which are useful for other people or maybe some creative and interesting works. For example, they can collect useful rubbish and create some interesting things. The other way of reducing crime is using free psychologists. The can speak whith people who have some proplems. For example, a person have not enough money and he do not know, what to do. He can do a mistake. But on the other hand, he can speak wich professional helper. I think that it is the best way of redusing some little crimes. But it can not stop a serious murder.

Another important note is that in Yakutsk summers is warmer that winters, while in Rio de Janeiro summers are colder than winters.

Also, a lot of parents think that these gadgets can cause problems with eyes and back of their children, because of the way of using gadgets of children.

Secondly, young people which use their smartphones a lot ofte have a headache, which decreases their ability to study. It is also known that modern technologies like the Internet and social networks can be the reason of emotional and psychological problems like depression.
There are some ways to reduce these health problems among people. For example people need to restrict time of being with some gadgets and give a rest for their brain. Also, they do not need to use smartphone before going to bed.

I totally disagree with this opinion. To my mind such politics are almost an instant crash course to the whole country. Despite I do not have a degree in economics or in relatable field, I will try my best to explain my disagreement.

To begin with, growing all consumable food inside the country brings up a threat of global starvation for all country residents due to bad harvests and/or cataclysms, and importing as little as possible will be a tough strike to state’s economy that will most likely result in decline of quality of life throughout the country. 

Secondly, not all countries have enogh fertile farm lands to produce enough food to all their population, and alternative methods of producing food are not as effective. Also, a lot of countries have imperfect climate for all sorts of food to grow, and some consist mostly of deserts, which makes said strategy at least questionable.

At last, even if all countries will manage to keep this policy, a lot of consumer food products become unavailable to most of people, and it may have some serious impact in the life of most people.

To conclude, the policy, stated in the beginning will have a devastating impact on any country, that decides to implement it, and only the healthy proportions of internal production and import can lead to stability and prosperity.

During the period of March 2012 to March 2013, number of desktop users decreased slightly – from around 150 millions to about 135 millions. On the other hand, amount of mobile users grew almost twice fold over that period – from just over 50 millions to almost 100 millions. Combining all of these numbers, we can also see that the popularity of Facebook still increases. Comparing gender Facebook usage patterns, we can see that men are not that different to women. Both sexes’ favorite pastime is sharing photos, and altruism, in form of finding out the ways to help others, is the least popular goal.

Because people, using Internet, can get goods and products with delivery, sitting at home. Also there are some types of robots which can do some basic tasks for you: cooking meal, cleaning the house and so on. To solve this problem, people should be more active, doing certain physical exercises and going for regular waks. People should understand that modern gadjets make you lazy and you should not use only your gadjets, you can do some tasks yourself.
Another health problem is problem with eyes. Children from the early childhood use different gadjets, such as: Iphones, Ipads, laptops and others. They are watching cartoons, videos on Youtube channel, playing online games during all the day and this can cause problems with eyes. To solve this problem, parents should limit time spending using the gadjets and parents should spend more time with their children: tell them fairy tales, go for a walk, do educational activities. For children it is better to go to sport and educational sections.
Nowadays there are a lot of different technologies that can help you in life and difficult situations, but people should make a limit for using gadjets, because they have both positive and negative effects. Negative effects should be reduced as they are dangerous for people’s health.

And it the government will introduce the law to reduce the amount of air travel, the price of air tickets will increase ad it increases cost for business it will effect to business climate in the country that is country will become more isolated.

One of the worldwidest measures that was found is increasing the amount of sport facilities and exercises. It includes services of different fitness clubs, producing more sport equipments, building more public gyms, swimming pools, involving people in some team games, such as football and so on.
On the one hand, this efforts will bring enough of success in changing people`s health in better way. For example, scientists proved that running for about two-three time a weak could lead to increacing theirs ability to work on hard things more longer and inprove selffeelings in whole body.

On the other hand, offering more sport facilities could lead to bad consenquencies.

For improving health of such people required some other methods such as keeping a special diet, long working on a fresh air or just more relax.

Obviously, young people are eager to get some experience which might come in handy in the future. Moreover, it may protect them from choosing the occupation which is not suitable for them. But on the other hand, it has some side effects. Let us compare its advantages and disadvantages.
Some people say that travelling is a golden opportunity to broaden the outlook. It is needless to say that a great amount of people are mad about it. Predictably, the graduates who are tired of studying consider going to unknown places to be a good rest. In fact students are often exhausted after taking their final exams. So they deserve to have some fun. Moreover, they are to meet new people whose ideas and opinions might change the graduates’ attitude to life and education. As a result, they become more mature and they will make less mistakes or even avoid decisions which are likely to be wrong.
At the same time, I must admit there are some disadvantages. Firstly, people lose their time and money instead of studying. Furthermore, they can get used to idle life so it will be no easy task to continue education. It will be incredibly difficult for them to concentrate on hard work.
To cut a long story short, I believe that its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. What I am driving at is that students had better not miss the opportunity to study. If I finished school this year, I would not interrupt my education.

Some of us believe that only the long prison sentences could fight the crime. They also think that killing prisoners for the hard issues those have made isn't a crime itself. MOre than this there are a certain amount of people wishing some of the prisoners to be killed. In the counties like muslim ones and in the some of the Amirican states it isn't a big deal and such thing happens quite often. But it does not goes along with the principle's of correct law.
And in Europe such kind of things are prohibited as for residents and citizencs of the country and so for law institutes.

NEvertheless, we can imagine the same in Russia. Prison is a very expensive institute to run. So we can put all of the prisoners in special settlent or even the simple, awful builings our country alreade have, so the new approches to reducing the crime should appeared.

Why do we punish the first group of people and ignore The second one? These number of people believe that it could lead to a “death” of cinema as a way of spending your freetime and meeting with your friends, because you can stay at home and watch a moovie.
The critics of punishment speak about the disability of comparison the crime like steeling something and pirate copying: the rate is the same. Moreover, it is very hard to bring some evidence and find a criminal, so it will only lead to overdealing among policemen. Well, to point out my own position I can say that nowadays the industry of cinema and music is transitioned into the internet area it is really convenient to stay at home and listen to music, for instance. All in all, despite this fact pirats break the rules and need to pay some money for it, but not be taken into prison.
In conclusion, we need to claim that government should think about the ways of making it easier for people to post music and films in the internet, as this industry is developing everydays. Legal ways sometimes are too costly , that is why all done illegaly. No matter if these changes will be done or not, there are differnt points of view on this issue.

There are a considerable number of ways to reduce crime level and make our lives safer, and they are often discussed. Some people suggest to make prisons sentences longer, while others see other opportunities to solve the problem. It seems to be clear why someone believes that longer inprisonments can be helpful in reducing crime. Firstly, it may influence criminals' mind: if they see the perspective to loose their freedom foe a significant number of years in prison, some of them will probably choose not to commit a crime. However, it seems to me that this way a mortal punishment will be a more effective way. Secondly, there is a popular point of view that years in prison can change a person considerably. During this long period of time he or she can sincerely regret about the deed and change the behaviour, but it is clear that, unfortunately, it does not happen with every criminal. Speaking about alternative methods of reducing crime, improving security system or, for instance, work with teenagers from poor families can be stated. Installing more video cameras in the streets and public places, developing new ways of cyber safety and constant training of policemen and other security staff might help to solve the problem. But it seems to me that it is more important to work with potential criminals and victims, not with the circumstances or consequences of a crime. It is a common knowledge that the possibility of commiting a crime is higher among people with criminal routes, uneducated and with the low living standards. A person, who has seen illegal way of living in the childhood, has more risks to commit a crime by himself. Therefore, it may be a good idea to pay more attention to needs of such people and, for example, provide more psychological work with their children. Speaking about crimes with ""normal"" children is not less important. Everyone should know the basic ways of self-defence in different situation and probably even be familiar with some fighting techniques. Overall, there are a significant number of various ways to make crimes not so common. Personally I believe that all these methods can be efficient only when they are used together and by qualified and honest government.

Schools should employ specialists to help students in solving these problems. Similiarly, special organizations which preserve children from such families should make better conditions for their living.

Secondly, people who copy and share the files not always do it in a good way. In result, download files are in a very bad quality. While bad quality can spoil the opinion about a good film or music.
In conclusion, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies make worse for original creators. But not all can allow themselves to buy original discs. So, these discs should be more acceptable.

In my view, it is partly true.

First of all, it should be clear that we live in 21st century. My point is that nowadays corporations are biggest part of our economy. And the fact of corporation's existense usually deneds on their successful deals. In order to make one of those, CEO has to meet different people as often as he can. And there is no better mean of transport for CEO than airplane. 

Furthermore, in many countries, such as Greece, Malta, Egypt, Turkey etc. economy strongly depends on tourism. If the tourists flow decline in this countries, they will have economical problem, such as recession, big inflation or even default. And all this actions will take place, if the governments forbid air travel.

However, there’re some arguments which prove the author's statement. The main of them is that airplane spend dozens tons of fuel which can pollute the atmosphere and in the nearest future there are no substitutres for the air fuel.

All in all, I can't say whether I'm strongly agree or disagree with the following statement, because both sides have their point. But if it were my choice, I'd rather not reduce the amount of air travel.

And now, when young people crime rates are higher than ever before, government and society are interested in the causes of the sudden increase in the level of crimes commited by young people and in the ways of solving this problem. This essay states that the causes of this development can be found in exsessive control of the young people and that the logical solution of this problem is to give them more freedom in their actions.
Before thinking about how to solve the problem we should understand the reasons why it did appear. As it was stateted above, the reason of the increase in crime rates by young people is the exsessive control of them from parents and teachers. The latter in order to provide education, right behavior, and safety restrict a lot of things: from watching cruel TV-shows to visiting some places and communication with their friends. The reaction of young people is the protest against such norms. To show that they do not agree with the way parents and teachers bring them up, they do something prohibited. And this has resulted in breaking the law. 
In order to solve this problem parents and teachers should accept a paradoxical thing: to lower the young people crime rates we should give them more freedom and stop to control them exsessively. Indeed, if teenagers were given more freedom in their actions, they would be happier and more satisfied with their current life and environment and would not try to do something prohibited to express their protest.
Parents and teachers, in their attempt to give a proper education, manners and behavior to teenagers, have reached the opposite thing - the increase in the level of crimes committed by them, because breaking the law is the protest agains exsessive control. Of course there are other reasons why young people have begun to break the law more often, but his one is the most important and requires an immediate solution.

That is the reason why the question about food production becomes very important. Now we are close to meet face to face the problem of overpopulation. And our generation must solve a lot of issues to make future for our children real. 

Coming back to food production, there is popular idea, that every country should produce food only for their own citiezens. It is interesting point of view, because all we know that priority geverment’s job is to take care of their people. If country produce enough food for it’s own people, the government doesn’t need to spend money for growing and upgradeing food production, tnstead of this that money can be saved for solving other problems. But if some other country can’t produce enough food? Should we keep canl and just look how many peoples die? This question is still open. 

On the other hand we have the opinion that countries should help each other. So, if some country can produce more food, it should be done. But where is the edge of this help? How much money should be spent for producing the food for other countries and how much for educateing (medicine help, etc) contry’s own citiesens? 

Today nobody has answers on this questions. But the time  is up, and the solution mush be found. Accordingly to me, they only right way is to help each other. We are all people. We should remember about it in difficult times, and do our best to save each life.

Of course, grated number of them think that people, who doesn’d buy the original discs should be punished because they are thefs.

First of all, I should notice that intellectual property, such as movie or musical composition, is still a property, that belongs to the person who made it. That’s why creators have they rights to earn money from selling copies of their arts. And internet piracy is a theft, because hundred millions dollars, that creators can borrow, are lost and people gets this arts for free

But there is another opinion: if producers and musicans want their arts to be famous, especially music composition, then they have to share it everywere, including internet. Also I should add that in XXI century no one is buying discs, because gagets can’t support them. So, I suppose, musicans should earn their money on live-shows, concerts and merch, and film producers on cinema and advertisment. If you doesn’t alloud your art to be shown on the internet, you can’t get such fame and oportunity to earn money.

In conclusion, I want to say, that both opinions has they right to exist. But, I disagree with punishment for Internet piracy, because anyway it helps producers and musicans to make their arts famous and after that to earn money on concerts and live-shows.

And is it good for their own country's economy? I think that advantages of this development are more significant than its disadvantages. Firslty, it provides a possibility to get the job for local people, which could be not so easy to find without the businesses of these international companies. Otherwise, it can make troubles to local business, but this fact can be fixed by taxes that the international companies would have to pay. Moreover, those taxes can be a good aid for the local economy. Secondly, the profits, that international companies get from the movement of their businesses, can let them make the prices lower not only in the country where they move but also in their home country. Then, international companies can bring some goods, that are not produced in the country where they move. The appearance of such goods can not only improve the level local people wealth, but even create some new markets, which would be able to stimulate the local businesses. For example, the appearance of ""Coca-Cola"" in Russia gave local businesses an opportunity to make their own coke or other beverages like this as it has become much more popular than it had been before.Of course there are some disadvantages of movement the international companies' business to poorer countries, as it can be difficult for local companies to share the market with such giants, but, as I have already said, it can be fixed by taxes.",65,2,3

Nevertheless, many people agrel that there are better approaches to punishment. It can be argued that longer sentences isolate criminals and, consequently, do not let them commit new crimes. Apparently, many murders and robbers tend to neglect law and repeat their murders and robberies. For instance, there was serial killer in the USA, who attempted to kill a family just after lies sentence had finished. Hence, longer limitations restrict such infamous people. Having said that, the criminal will have carried his burden to one day anyway, so this solution does not guarantee constant safety. On the other hand, many people are in favour of the idea that capital punishment or obligatory jobs re more appropliate. The former is the most effective way to get rid of the most violent killers. Obviously, after the death penalty new crimes are impossible. Although seemingly beneficial for society, it is worth nothing that the approach is in human and entalls new murders. The other debatable option is to let some people be punishes by monitory activities.  The reason for it is simple: the government will not allocate money for prisons. Moreover, there will be additional saved funds from criminals free labor force. Talking everything into account, I deem the second option is feasible. In case the repeated crime is inevilable, it is better to either, completely reduce its probability to get financial profits. Of two evils choose the besser.

This is happening in many countries so it is essential to understand the causes of misbehaviour and find possible solutions to that issue.

To begin with, this  problem is very common, it doesn’t have any national, local or cultural differences. So it should be considered as a psychological issue that deals with children behaviour. Let us look into causes that stimulate misbehaviour.

First of all, it’s boredom that students feel very often at school. Boring lessons trigger lack of attention and desire to enteract youself. That is why, some students start talking to each other, others make funny jokes and loud and even begin fighting. 

The second reason is that a school is a social institute with its structure and division. So some students are good at studying, whereas others are brilliant at sport. Strong students can bully weak ones.

Certainly, there are some problems to mention too but we will focus particular on these two. In order to resolve the first problem, lessons should be more exciting and interesting. Teachers ought to motivate and encourage students. Regarding the second problem, it can be recommended to put emphasis on physical education at school so that weak students also get involved in sport and became stronger and stronger.

To draw the conclusion, I can say that exist now can be easily resolved inside schools with the effort of teachers and school administration. So it’s up to the school whether to try these methods or not.

We should understand that musicians and movie producers have spent a tremendous time and budget in order to bring this masterpiece into real life.

Nothing can be free! If you considered others produce for free than you have to do the same thing work free? However, human’s self-egoism wants only him being paid and others labor for free. Therefore, relasing piracy copies and downloading creators works for free form left online pages brings a great harm and even may prevent a future best products from occurring since creators are lost in the previous one and have no intentions to generate another one. 

Unfortunately, in our country the fight against piracy is not well established or well developed in the comparison with west countries such as EU or North America, In our dauly life we can be witness of many our friend who are occuped with piracy downloading of movies or music. From my perspective, we have to use soft power point of punishment and get people fined police for that actions that can be beneficial for both for the government and the producers of thus masterpieces.

These industries are driven by large sums of money. They create an original content that the audience wants to pay for. And the problem is that any work with built in creativity is pot under pressure when the money comes in to the game. That happens when the producers and creators forget about ethical side and start to earn money for empty senseless product. 

In my opinion, as far as big industry players concerned, it is not unforgivable to download some of their materials. You may want to go to the cinema when a new sequel of famous franchise comes out but only because you want to be in the trend and avoid spoilers on the Internet.

On the other hand we have small directors and unknown talented music artists that want to seen and earn for living with their work. In this case I strongly support buying the original product. The profit from selling goes straight to the creator and it contributes to his future work. It is win win story. You have an exclusive product, a viayl or a DVD, that will stay for you way longer than a downloaded file on the computer. The feeling of a physical copy is more authentic to me. 

All in all, I think no one should be strictly punished for listening to a song or watching a film privately even from a downloaded copy. But I encourage people to appreciate a good original content and paying for it.

The most important advantage of rising a sport activity among people is that it helps to keep fit and make better a your muscles. All sportsmen look great and feel themselves more pleasant. Secondly, sport can be a popular activity for a group of people. They will have an opportunity to meet their friends and spend time more useful.

While people nowadays argue wether drug using athlets should be banned from professinal sport for the rest of their lives or not, I am going to introduce my own opinion on this topic and support my arguments with relevant examples.
Firstly, if we take a look on the statistics of violanting sport laws by using illigal drugs for today, we may see that it is rather common problem for all the countries and sport organisations. Thus, banning athlets for using drugs from competing professionaly for a limited period does not solves the problem of the topic anyhow. So this kind of punishment just does not help the modern sport.
On the contrary, total ban for a drug using professional sportsman, I believe, is required in most cases. Why? For the two reasons. One of them is that usage of illigal drugs during the professional sport activity is an extremely rude abuse of sport ethics. And the final reason is that using different kinds of illigal drugs in proffesional sport just ruins the idea of objective competition by raising the results of drug-using sportsmen.
In conclusion, we should admit that using of illigal drugs is rude violation of sport law, so it must be strictly prohibited and sportsmen who violate this law absolutely must be banned from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives in order not to allow such problem of the modern sport occure anymore.

Ones said that every country should take care about getting food inside country as much as they can. In my opinion is that the goverment should firstly think about economical reasons of producing food. 

To begin with, there are more than 200 countries in the world, so we can’t have an universal receipt of how and where get and produce the food. For example, russian territory is not good enough for planting some fruits, but population, who lives there, needs to eat them to get a needable resourses, so it is sensible to buy them from another countries. Secondly, food market is one of the largest so there is no economical profit of closing market to produce only for own population.

However, there is some disadvantages of having every borders opened to other countries. Firstly, importing food from abroad led to negative economical effects. The main importers of food do not have an aim of improving an agricultural complex at all. That’s why for such a long time Russia, country with a biggest size of fields didn’t planting as much as she can. So, more and more farmer’s families became very poor. In addition, when most of food, which population eats, is producing incide of country, less money is gong away from it. Protecting of national agriculture can be very profitable for a government because of getting more taxes from a population. 

However, country should be sensible in understand thein planting possibilities. Severe climate countries should buy food from other countries with warmer climate or investing in developing new ways of getting a food for their population, All depends about what is more profitable and good for people.

However, there are those who claim that this not the best option and there are better ways of reducing the crime. I personally support those who think that giving longer prison sentences would only make the situation worse. Firstly, the prisoners form a very specific kind of society which has a great impact on everyone who is a part of it. The more time one spends in this society, the more used to it they are going to get, and their mind would turn into a mind of a real criminal even though their first crime was not that terrible. Secondly, the chances to adopt to normal life after the prison sentence are already low as prisoners lose their skills and knowledge, and thereputation of even former criminals makes employers to avoid giving them a job, and a great number of years spent in prison makes it even more hard. However, those who support the idea of longer prison sentences claim that this the best choice as the criminals are isolated for a longer period of time, which means that common citizen are more protected from them. I see the point, but to my mind the disadvantages are too big to ignore them. Firstly, prisons are built and run with these common citizens' taxes, so if the prisons are full, then people have to pay more money for them, and this amount can become extremely big. Secondly, many of isolated criminals will get free eventually and, according to the second paragraph of this work, they will get back to their criminal business again as there is no way for them to start a new life after so many years in jail. In conclusion I would like to state that giving longer prison sentences are a too simple approach to the crime problem. The real solutions should be far more complicated and mild as the best way to reduce the crime is not to let people do anything for which they can be sentenced, and this means that it is more about improving people's education, moral principles and values instead of laws.",70,2,1

There are many facilities that causes them. And one kind of this ficilities is transport of air travel. And one of the solution of this problem is to reduce the amount of unnecessary travel, for example, for business and leisure. On the one hand, it seems to be suitable solution of problem without air pollution and global warming. There are a lot of unnecessary flights, for example, travels for business and leisure for not long distance. For example worker can reach the necessary city by train instead of by plane. And in this case introducing laws of reduce the amount of air travel is an excellent solution to save our environment. On the other hand, there are many places which are in long distances. And achieving them by train or by car require many days. In the same time we can achieve them by plane in some hours. Many people do not have so much time to spend it on travelling. Also there are many people that can not stand travelling by car or by train. They prefer to travel by plane. Also if we reduce the amount of air travel, it changes traffic on roads, more cars will be on road, and as we know cars also have bad influence on environment. And in this case this solution not seems to be appropriate solution. To sum up, introducing laws that will reduce the  amount of air travel is not the excellent way to solve problem with air pollution and global warming. It will be better to find some another ways, for example, such as finding some technologies that will reduce the influence on environment by transports of air travelling.

That leads to the overuse of air means of transport which causes air pollution and global warming effect. Some people believe that there is nothing serious in thousands of planes in the sky. Others think that it is a great threat to the environment and we have to cut down the amount of air travel. As far as I am concerned the plane is the fastest way of travelling in the world. For example, it takes just a few hours to fly from Moscow to Saint-Petersburg compared with 10 hours wasted in a car or a train. Moreover, it is much more convinied and less dangerouse than going by bus. Sometimes it is the only possible method to move from one place to another. Finally, today there are government programmes which make the airlines companies install “green” engines in planes in order to reduce the amount of exhausted gases going out in the atmosphere and, as the result, cut down air pollution. On the other hand, not so many airlines use environment friendly equipment these days because it costs enough and companies have no profit from it. Furthermore, there are a lot of extremely old planes which are 20 or more years old. All in all, these factors make us think twice abut the introduction of special laws not to reduce only the amount of air travel but to cut down the amount of waste produced by one plane. To sum up, it is strongly believed that the number of air travelling as an essential part of the word infrastructure. Trying to block it will lead to terrible consequences for the world economy, culture and other spheres of human activity. However, we should do our bets to make the plane not become the factor which destroys our planet.

It is widely considered that such copying is illegal and should be punished. Still, the are some opposing points of view, that should be taken into account.
On the one hand, enormous amounts of money are not only spent by musicians and film producers on making media product, but also lost from pirate copying. In other words, media-makers don’t get as much money as they deserve for selling their product, but also suffer high costs of production. These costs should be at least partly covered by the price paid by consumers. Otherwise, such uncontrolled copying can lead to crisis in media industry. That means, that quantity and quality of media products would reduce if only rich media-producers could afford to create unit of media. For this reason, it is better to punish people, who share and download pirate copies.
On the other hand, media-makers make a lot of money for presentation of their media-products at a public places (like concerts, cinemas etc). Still, many people don’t earn enough money to spend them on pieces of culture. Unfortunately, the majoritys households income is only enough to buy good of first need, like food and cloths. If free downloading is strictly forbiden, the cultural degradation of the society may began. People, especially young one, need an access to free media products in order to discover the world, life and their personality.
To conclude, I consider that pirate copying should not be punished, as cultural development f the society must be in priority before some amount of money lost by another media producer.

But what are the reasons of this tendency and what, more importantly, can be done, to prevent it from future exacerbation? These are the questions to discuss.

Firstly, the increasing level of juvenile deliquency can be explained by the amount of freedom, granted to people in general. Less severe gun control policies and the abolition of capital punishment in many states question the authority of the government for the common people. And young people are more perceptive to this rebellious spirit.
Secondly, the proportion of the youngsters does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the crime. So the increase in question may show not the rise in murders, but in rather less serious mischiefs, like, for instance, smoking in public places. And the growing proportion of the young people here can be explained by the absence of true crime in the eyes of young criminals, which, so to say, legalize such actions.

What about the measures to be taken, these are mostly the duty of parents and teachers. They ought to show their own respect to law by their own example and teach the importance of other people's life and property, as no one can guarantee one's own safety.

All in all, we should not jump the gun and blame violent films and videogames for the growing juvenile deliquency, as it is mainly the guilt of the system and people's nature, that nudges the youngsters towards mischief. But solutions do exist and measures can be taken to slow down this downward movement.",70,2,2

This process has both negative and positive sides. First of all, all we know that the economic sphere is one of the most important. It organizes our lives and services which we use. That is why big organizations always try to make the production cheaper, in order to let people buy services for small costs. Developing countries can give that chance. Moreover, such countries often don’t have their own production, so that developed ones give working places and provide poor ones with the ability to earn money this kind of business developes the world’s economic issues. On the other hand, organization of the businesses in poor regions has dramatic consequences. If companies try to make the producing of goods cheaper, they often forget about conditions in which poor workers have to do their job and sometimes live. What is more, such trend of moving the businesses to developing countries has a great influence on the Europe economics. Other developed countries just don’t have the opportunities to get money and to be in the circulation of money. It appears in world crisises and stagnations which lead to financial collapses. To sup up all the facts, I can say, that disadvantages of transporting the business to the countries of the 3rd world are worse than advantages. Furthermore, the negative consequences of that are too difficult to terminate. That is why we should prevent them, not to correct.

But there are another ones, that don’t control Internet sphere and it is become mostly pirate (Eeat Europe). In my personal opinion, illegal pirate copies in our reality is absolutely normal thing. Why? First of all, there are really a lot of content (music, films, books) in Internet. So, it is difficult to regulate this sphere. Second, some people have no chance to pay for useful content. For example, people in African counties or in some Asian counties really have no money to pay for books as more reach countries. And third, there are a lot of ways to make money for musicians, filmmakers and authors. They can give some concerts, lectures for money. Also, they can use advertising as a way to have money by recommending or advertising some products.
To summarise the information above, copying and sharing music, films or books is normal process in modern world. As i have remainded before, Internet is very difficult to regulate sphere. Also, If we talk about regulation, there are some problems with it – countries, where human rights may be ignoring by its government, it is too risky to close platforms. In example of autoritarian counties we see the situation, when the most country’s population have no information about political prisoners, about corruption and so on.
To be honest it is need to say that authors of books, music or films really lose huge amount of money, but as i say before – regulation is not the best solution. And for musicians, filmmakes, authors there are a lot of other ways to have money for their products.

Nevertheless, others say that it is bad solution of problem and it is necessary to use other measurers. I am sure that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best solution of problem. First of all, sport is very important for our health. People which practise sports have a strong immunity system, they do not suffer from diseases and they have a perfect body with big muscules. So, doing sport is the very big advantage for public health. However, some say that increasing the number of sports facilities is bad idea because there are lot of other measures to improve public health. It can be limited amount of junk food restaurant in the city. People will not go to the McDonald’s and other restaurants and so their health will be better. Another way to improve public health is making the price of medicaments and antibiotics more low. So medicaments will become more available for poor ill people. Nevertheless, I suppose that if the government will build a lot of sports gym with swimming pools, table tennis, baskets, fields for golf and so on, people will visit gyms with pleasure a lot of times. As a result public health will become more strong and better. In conclusion, it is need to say that the health is very important thing for all. The health for man is his richness. So it is necessary to improve public health with help of all available ways, especially, with help of sport.

From my point of view, there is a right position in many relations.

To begin with, we should agree that one student does not have guarantees of getting a job after finishing the university. It is evident that people of both male can have such issue. If males or females do not have enough access to study a particular subject, they will not get concrete jobs as they will not have necessary skills. This will make the state of affairs worse than it is now. That is males and females should be allowed to study disciplines in equal proportion.

Another argument is that in modern world more and more women prefer to do some business instead of having a family. There can be plenty of obstacles in the country that do not allow females to stay at home and look after their children (geographic position, demographic politics of the government and so on). In this case one woman has to work but there is no need to say that at first she should learn some skills. But if the university does not give possibilities to women to be the student of one or another faculty, then they will not be able to start their career and, as a consequence, will have the lack of means to study without any restrictions.

Thus, in present days there is a number of problems connected with finding a job for both males and females. Unequal possibilities to study for different males certainly will create one more problem potential workers.

There are some reasons why plains are the most comfortable transport.But instead this, people should to think about that the air travel is problem of air pollution and global warming. And sometimes people should found allternative decisions.
First and the main reason is economy of time. You can spend more time if you use bus or train to go somewhere. Second reason that modern plains are very comfortable and you enjoy when you use it. Third reason, sometimes in buses and trains are dirty, but in plains are always clear.
Summarize all these reasons, people prefer to use plains more than another transport. Very often they do not think about air pollution and global warming, when they buy tickets to the plane.But it does not change the situation, and this is also the big problem.

In my opinion goverments should introduse laws, when air travels between near cities and countries are not needfull. People can use plains when they have long air travel. For example, to go from Moscow to Saint Petersburg people can use bus, train or sapsan exept plain. I think such travelling helps to reduse air pollution and global warming.

In conclusion, goverments can not reduce all plains travelling, because the most people already can not imagine their lifes without plaining. But goverment can reduce the plainig between near cities, wheen the time of travelling makes up no more than 10 hours.",55,2,2

The society has softened a bit lately so the sanctions for bad behaviour are sometimes believed to be not as effective as they were. Schools are one of the places where such behaviour can actually be improved.

First of all, we need to find out why some students behave themselves worse than others. There are several reasons for that. For example, the person has developed a bad character and so takes pleasure of making lives around close people hell. This is a severe case but a really possible one. The other reason comes straight from the previous one. It is the delusion of superiority. The students behaves bad because he thinks that he is better than anyone around, can do whatever he wants and no punishment will come. He could even not care about the punishment. The next reason may be the personal problems, usually connected with the family. When there are conflicts at home all the time, the child usually has two ways to go: to become this “bad guy” or lock all his emotions and feelings into himself becoming “heartless”. So private problems have a really great impact on a person as well.

But this problem can be solved. First of all, a good teacher will always try to calm down this student or even talk to him personally so that wouldn’t affect his “position” in class. It sometimes works but not always. If this does not work a teacher should go to parents and explain the problem to them and try to persuade them to pay more attention to their child. There are also severe cases of the rebellion of the class against a “bad guy” but this happen really seldom, because they are usually afraid of him.

To sum up, students’ behaviour is a really important issue because it  influences not only the person but also everybody around him, which is bad for education. So this should be taken more seriously by those who care most – parents and teachers.

Some say it is just for fun, others argue that social media is a major source of information today. In this essay I will discuss both points of view and give my opinion. First, let me start with the view that social media is not only bad entertainment. Facebook and Vkontakte are the source where every news item appears immediately. Surfing these sites one doesn’t have to listen to the radio or watching TV to stay on track. Moreover, access to these network systems let people share documents, projects, videos, pictures that might be useful for studying or work. For example, all students nowadays use the internet to share opinions about homework or simply help each other to understand sometimes. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the view that the major aim of surfing network systems is entertaining. It is not secret that most people hang on VK or Facebook to relax after a busy day watching funny videos and images. Sometimes it means just wasting time, but on the other hand, it might be the only chance to award life hundles for some people. Besides, in our global world social media is the only opportunity to keep in touch with friends and relatives abroad. Many regard this possibility as relaxing and entertaining, not sharing the information. To sum up, taking into consideration both views I would say that social media is abroad sharing information as well as entertaining. To my mind, these sources give us a lot of advantages. They way to use it depends on the person and the one wants to satisfy.

Modern technologies are really developed. With the help of them people can do everything on the internet and such progress cause a huge problems for a films or songs creators. First of all, musicians and producers do not get their money and have a lot of costs. If creators lose money, they would not have an opportunity to pay for actors and other people, who were involved in the process of film, clip or song making. Secondary, investors are not interested in activities, where they pay a huge amounts of money and other people just “steal” their production and money. Investors prefer to avoied such spheras where pirates can use special programmes and steal everything so easy.
Another significand reason why pirates are dangerous for industry of entertainment and producers or musitions is that actors or singers do not be inspired to take part in activities after that they will not get respect, glorial.

Whilst some people struggled for it, others advocated against it. Let is discuss the main advantages and disadvantages phenomenon.


On the one hand, many people are confident that freedom of art is a necessary part of any modern government. First of all, it gives everyone an opportunity to express themselves as well as show the reality. Therefore, it can be inconvinient for some authorities. For example, in USSR there was a strong censorship at every stage including art, thereby those who didn't follow the rules were punished dramatically. This seems to be absolutely savage nowadays, although it still takes place in some countries. It is proven that censorship presence leads to a massive depression which is a bad sign for any government. In order to keep their position, they should provide freedom to the citizens, including artists. The other reason to support it is that any art debelops only with new ideas. It is dreadful to forbid artists to create, as the art can simply dissapear.


On the other hand, there is always a flip side. Many groups of people notice that modern art became meaningless and poor once it was given all freedom. They prefer to look back at past masters to satisfy their taste.


All things considered, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. I am inclined to think that it is very important to have art freedom as it lets people express themselves and improves art.

Besides, the country's population would not really have a benefit from the developing of Astronomy, at leas in a clear way.
However, as well as any scientific research, scientific exploration do provide a long-term benefit for a country, such as inclusion in the world shared academic and scientific community.
However, all those opinions are relevant, I tend to think that country should solve peoples' problems in the first place, and take interest in space exploration only when there is a healthy inner atmosphere in it.",65,2,0

Modern technologies include huge amount of different items and definitions, but there is one thing, which has totally changed our live, it is gadgets. Among widespread problems live vision problems, troubles with sleep, headaches and even obesity the most important seems that technologies enter deeply in our brain and psychological sphere. Modern people can not do almost simple things without robots: cleaning, washing up or just talking, people stopped communicate in life they are always in their phones, creating illusion of communication.

The best way to reduce those effects is reduce amount of time and activities, where we use gadgets, for example, we can just change electric book for real, feel it’s smell and enjoy touching of pages or turn off our phone for 30 minutes before going to bed to sleep better. We have to understand that real life consist from people emotions and other things we can feel, but not from wi-fi and videogames. 

To conclude, modern technology are the important part of our life and like all things in the worlds have bad effects. So, we should reduce part of it in our day. In other case we will be suffer from lack of activity and someday become heroes of cartoon “Valli” about humanity living in space. They uncapable even to go by themselves and all things receive through technologies.

To prove this it is enough to remember about space race between USA and USSR during The Cold War in the 20th century. However, space exploration asks for a lot of money. Many people think that, probably, it would be better to spend this money for more everyday problems.
In my opinion, goverments should put urgent problems first and pay much more attention to them than to space exploration. First of all, goverments need to look after theis citizens, not after stars. They must build new roads, improve hospitals and educational system. If countries have money for spaceships but do not have good level of life, it is bad goverment. Stars are wonderful but millions people in the world live in poverty and cannot afford even their own home. Society problems should be solved before space exploration because spaceships and colonies on Mars would not be needed by anyone, if there are dying citizens who cannot affort healthcare.
Secondly, space exploration has no practical aim now. It is only science. It cannot improve or change life of counties. If so, why would goverment waste citizens' money for this? For example, International Space Station is a great project but it means nothing to everyday life. Some of money should be spent for space but only for support of science. At the same time it seems like for many countries space exploration is a question of death and life. This fact is weird because it does not solve problems and would not in many years.
In conclusion, developing of science is important part of budgets. However, this part should not be made by cutting other parts, which are more crucial for society. There are poverty and many poor-educated people in the world. Probably, they should be helped and saved first. Spaceships can wait.",70,2,1

According to this, some people claim that each subject in university should be attended by equal quantity of men and women.
To my way of thinking, I can not fully agree with them.
From my point of view, there are some positive and some negative consequences. If we accept this, male and female will study this subject in an equal humbler and we will have equal rights and abilities. There will be no discrimination and many people will be happy. More women can get a job and make a career. As a consequence, they will feel themselves better if one women works not only with many decades of men, but with some women too. However, there are some negative effects. For instance, a number of very clever and intelligent people cannot attend this subject just because of sex. I am deeply convinced that it is wrong. We should accept people to course by estimation of their skills and education. Moreover, there is an only way to provide equal rights and opportunities for people. It is does not meter who you are - man or woman; you have to prove that you are really good student or worker.
This issue is very controversial because various people view the problem from different and even opposite perspectives. The problem is important and very crucial nowadays because it is closely connected with a wide range of problems.

To start with, some people can experience very significant and tough life situations which change their further behaviour patterns and the way of thinking a lot. For instance, after the death of the relative a person begins to value the lives of members of his family and his friend more than before and becomes kinder to them. Moreover, people tand to change when somebody important for them asks them to. As a result we sacrifice our own interests and try to change some of our negative traits of character. Besides, when we make a mistake, we try to avoid it in the future. Consequently, we change our behaviour opinion order to face the same situation.
Nevertheless, from the very time we were born we tend to show some specific patterns of behaviour which remain the same during all our lives. What is more , the children often show that they are interested in some spheres in a very early age. It can signal that some personality traits form in the childhood influence on further life.
Despite other people's opinions I personally believe that the major influence on our personalities is caused by some life situations and experience we get through life. At the same time our personality is formed by both factors but some of our characteristics have a possibility be changed depending on life events.

To begin with, all subjects can be divided into several groups. For instance, there are some math, “exact” disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. On the other hand, literature, languages and some other subjects are unated into gumanytary sciences. In addition, nowadays there are a lot of creative new subjects, for example, photography, design and so on that studetns can choose. To my mind, the most part of girls and women have a gumanytary state of mind while boys and men are more successful at math and physics.
Undoubtedly, when there is an equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, it gives people a chance to improve their manners and socializing skills. However, as far as I am concerned, one woman understand other woman better than man because of our phsycological and brain. That is why in case of doing some research or discussing topic of the class male and female students can have problems in understanding each other.
Last but not the least argument in order to support my point of view is the question of personal interest of each graduates from school. As for me, I choose some disciplines that give me a chance to improve my professional skills. That is why I prefer to attend Mathematics while other girls in my group choose English or culture.

Some are sure that it is enough just to increase the number of sport facilities for improving our health, others claim that it is a waste of money and it will not really influence people. So, who is right? On the one hand, sport clubs and other sport events and activities made more people to keep themselves in a good form. It is becoming up-to-date to have a fit body and to visit sport clubs. Furthermore, more and more people refuse smoking and drinking alcohol because of its sport-addiction. Finally, different kinds of public facilities is a very convenient way of doing sport for those people who can not do it professionally, but they have an ability to loose some energy after their job. On the other hand, any sport facilities can change people’s minds. There are so many people who can use sport facilities and eat fastfood, have some other bad habbits such as smoking at the same time. Apart from that, it can not decrease air, water pollution because of which people suffer so much or cure cancer. I also support the idea that sport facilities is not the only measure we need to take. It must be complex and include as lessons at schools about healthy way of life as prohibition of smoking in all public places and many others. In conclusion, I would kike to say that of course implanting of different sport facilities in our daily life has some results and more and more people care about their health and about the way they look. But it is not enough anyway. The measures must be complex and they should influence mental part of our life, as well as our appearence.

It can be seen that the largest reduction was in the South Asia from 32,7 to 9,9 millions of children. The highest percentage of kids without primary education goes to Africa. Although the number of African children has fallen to approximately 33 millions stayed the biggest one.
What is more, in 2000 all regions had more girls without access to primary education but in 2012 the number of them was less that the number of boys in the South Asia and the rest of world. Only Africa saved the statistics (more girls than boys) with 18,2 and 14,5 million representatively.

However some may disagree that life experiences are more important when it comes to the personality and I agree with them.
First of all, there is no doubt that genes of our ancestors play a major role on individuals as persons. They give features that are common to our fathers and mothers and we have to live with them for our entive life. Those features are both physical and psychological. However it is more appropriate to say that a person is a master of his destiny.
With different experiences in a life time one can change his points of view easily and it reflects on ones personality. For example, traumatic experiences such as war puts a human under extreme conditions that later result in various principles changes, put under a question moral views and twists ones perspective of surroundings in general. But it shouldn’t necesarrily be a traumatic experience for a lot of people believe in discipline as a good way to grow as a person. There are many life stories that describe how a man decides to change and turn his life around. It can be ver y challenging but it’s al ways possible.
To say that one is born for something or destined to be someone is a very lazy way to excuse in order not to try and set your characteristics the way one wants them to be. Of course given features matter a lot but there’s always many way to agnire different skills that complete a man. Personality is a subjective matter and we are all in change of decisions, in a long run.

However, there is an opposite point of view. Those who argued that sport facilities are worthless say that there are other ways to increase public health I do believe that the first statement is true and the more sport activities are required the healthier nation will be.


The first arguement to prove that the increasing of public health depends on sports facilities is that if there are plenty of different sport places it will be more affordable for people with lower budgets to do sport not only by themselves, nut also by their children. It seems to be an issue, because nowadays, for example in Russia it is affordable only for rich people. It is obvious that without the ability for youth to be healt there is no chance for improving public health.


However, there is another point of view, which is opposite to mine. Some people argue that increasing the quantity of clinics or medical centres will be a better decision. As for me there is enough of those stuff, but if they are not doing their best. It would be better to open new swimming pools, tracks and ground on the free spaces, and in the same time, qualify those medical care that we already have. 


Taking everything into consideration, the advantages overweigh its drawbacks, so it is worth opening them, than to do some other mesures.

The others think that sportsmen will continue taking drugs till they wouldn't be banned for the rest of their lives. Let's discuss them.
On the one hand, drugs are illegal in many countries. Taking drugs is a crime not only in sport but in general. And the punishment for it in Russia is strict: from 2 to 18 years in prison. However, after being punished the career of a sportsman shouldn't stop. Doing sport and taking part in competitions is the only way they can earn on their livings. Moreover, it won't be just an end of their professional careers but the end of their lives.
On the other hand, once a sportsman tries an illegal drug his reputation will be spoiled forever. In addition, not only the name of an athlete but the name of the whole country will be in shame. And it will take a lot of time to gain an authority again. That's why such athletes should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives.
In my opinion, such sportsmen who broke the law should be panished for a short-term period and then have a chance to come back to competitions.
All in all, despite all of that, we are all people and we make mistakes. Everyone should have a second chance, that's the way we learn about life.

Sometime modern artists make their works whichcould seem so disgusting or not allowed to show a young children, but creative artist don't think about it. For example, modern artistfrom Saint Petersburg who came to Moscow and nailed himself onto red square, moreover without any clothes. Also hedid something extraordinairy.

To my mind, the best way of studying foreign language is in the age of 6-7. According to scientists in the age from 6 to 10 we have the maximum of ability to remember. When I was in primary school I remember that I learned about 50 per cent from my vocabulary. 
More over it easier to study foreign language, because in this step of education children formed the system of language from his native language, which are obligatory study on primary level.
On the other hand, the study of foreign language is hard work, especially for children.  Sometimes you really tried to study, for example, grammar or other difficult part of language. Also many children are loosing the interested to foreign language after 3 month from begging.
In conclusion, I want to say that all disadvantages of studying foreign languages in primary school are temporary and most of them are not so great, as many thinks.

But here come rather philosophical questions: What do you mean saying “happiness”? How can you come to a happy life?
As far as myself is concerned I can say that I fully support that point of view, because I think that the happiness is the basis of your life. If you are happy, you can easily reach any goals you want.
To my mind happiness is something which makes your heart beats, something which makes your life colourful. I remember the story of Russian aviator Alex Meresev, whose happiness was rather huge and could fly far in the sky. But one black day he lost his legs in a crash and doctors said that he would never fly again. As I have already said Mr. Meresev couldn’t live without flying, he trained alot¬ and at last he learned how to fly without legs.
But not everyone think that flying is happiness¬¬¬. That is why it is rather hard to define, to read ‘what is it’ just taking a dictionary.
In my opinion if you want to achieve happiness, you call yourself ‘happy’, you should, firstly, tell yourself what is happiness for you.
Secondly, you should work and work to achieve your happiness. Happiness here is like a dream, but you can get it, it is not the same with ‘riding a unicorn’.
My mother had a dream. She wanted to live with a family in Moscow. She came to Moscow, studied hard in university, work hard as an economist, and now she can call herself happy, she realized her dream, she got her happiness.
In conclusion it should be said that you can make your life happy, you can live in happiness. You just need to work and believe in your own dream.

Firstly, this essay will describe some problems connected with using of technologies and then there will be given solutions to redusement of negative effects. 

The main problem is that people spend, or sometimes have to, too much time doing their work or everyday activity with the usement of different types of computers. In result, they may feel blindness, headache, pain in eyes after it. The results of the recent research made by the “Modern life” proved that people, who spend their both free and wording time outdoors, were more positive and had less problems than the different group, which had to work all day long in the office. 

It lead to the main decision for this problem, as it means, that to reduce the negative effect of different types of computers on people’s health, they need sped more time, doing their leasure activities apart from technology. In other words, it means that the using of machines makes people to forget about real life but as they appeared to be biological creatures, the outdoor life can be called their natural need. The investigation of Russian research company “Health today” in 2010 revealed that having at least 2 days per week for outdoor activities is necessary to reduce the influence of modern technologies on health. 

To conclude, this essay shows that one of the main solutions to reduce the among of health problems caused by technologies is being more active and spending more time outdoors.

Compared to previous periods today it has reached unseen before level. Why this is happening in our instantly developing world? And how we can deal with that problem? This is what this essay is about.
It is obvious, the main cause is careless parents. Nowadays some of them believe that modern technologies (like Internet) and teachers in schools can substitute them in explaining to a kid what is good and what is bad. However that is not true. Children need intant guidance in our world and if parents think lessons in school are enough, then there will be a lack of knowledge about crimes consequences. The situation becomes even worse when a child become a witness of committing a crime at home, i.e. home violence.
It seems, rooms for improvement here are pretty clear. First of all, we need to make parents really caring about their children. This is the only way we can fill the blanks in the youngs’ understanding the fact that violence and crime are strongly unacceptable. For example, government can strenghten parents’ responsibility for their kid's behaviour by arresting them. Second, teachers in schools can start a course about crimes where would be explained about consequences of commiting a crime and how to deal with problems in legal ways.
To conclude, I believe the main reason why modern society faces extremely high rates of the young’s crimes compared to other years is growed parents inability to take care of their children due to technology and school overpricing. To reduce that rate, I would recommend to encourage parents to teach their kids using government measures and to add a new course about crimes into school learning plan.

There are a great number of debates wheather air travels pollute nature and contribute global warming or not. Of course, it reduce time for travel but, may be, planes are cause of much consequanses for environment. I somewat agree with the statement, that government must commite different limits on air travel in order to prevent global warming.
First of all, there are many things to be said in favour of introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travels. It can not be denied that planes like cars pollute flora by burning fossil fuels and motor oil which consist of chemical dangerous elements. It leads to increase of temperatures, to say nothing of global warming.
Secondly, for this reason, reducing of deathes would be a positive step in saving nature. in recent years there are a wide range of crashes of planes. It becomes a cause of people’s deathes. If government introduced laws of reducing the number of air travel for business and leisure we would not be so worried about the international statistics of crashes of planes.
On the other hand, it goes without saying that air travel is recognised to be the fastest way of journey. It is inevitably that people will always be enthusiastic about air travel. It has a lot of benefits: fast, convenient, comfortable and with frequent service transport.
Having analyiesed these reasons, it worth concluding that it would be simplistic to state categorically that air travel has good or bad impact on the nature. It depends on how you use it and clearly, it is better in moderation then in excess. I would like to say that government must become more centered on this issue. Because true measures need to be taken.

Another problem is that children and young people can loose their eye vision because they sit in front of TV, gadges and computers too. The solution of these two problems is very simple: people must go walk on the fresh air, do some sport and limited themselves of using gadges.

There are a lot of other problems, for example, people become more selfish, rude, their attention at surroundings would become lower but these problems are appears to personal and not cause any health problems.

But some people also think that using technology depends on person and only he watches on his health. It is very strong opinion and, actually, it is very true, but technology in our days become more and more widespread, so people can not stop of using it.

This problem is really controversial and there are two different views. 
It is clear that creative people have talent. We are living in free society, so everyone can express his opinion and ideas. Creative people should have freedom. There are some arguments that can support this point of view. Firstly, for most artists expressing their ideas is a way of life.  They can not live without music,  pictures and poems. Secondly, they earn money through expressing their own ideas. For example, sell paintings or music. Moreover, artists express their feeling in works of art. Furthermore, they can tell about issues that exist in our society in their works. So, people can understand problems and think of them. 
On the other hand, full freedom can be dangerous for society. Some modern artists spoil buildings with their paintings. Also some pieces of art can be very dangerous for children conscious. For example, films or paintings that illustrate erotic actions and naked people. So it is logically to restrict some ways of expression ideas. 
These arguments might seem persuasive, but it is really important to take into account that people should be free to express their ideas. It can bring in our life creative and fresh views and ways of solving problems.

They try to get the same treatment in every tield of live. Sometimes buch activity leads sertain in a ividuals to think that even educational programs of every subject should provide the same number of students of both sexes.  Personally, I can not agree with that statement.
There is no doubt , that people of every social groups should be equally presented in every social institution.  Women must be able to elect and be elected as men individual. There must be no discrimination during biring at work according to gender and other carachter istics which are not correspond to protecssional qualities. Every person in Russia and in any ather country has constitiunal right for getting education. And restriction of this right is unacceptable.
To my mind, there is no reasonable arguments for linnitting the number of students due their gender. More over, such idea can be spesulted in grave consequences. For instance, if we destlict someone in their right for higher education it can cause the termination of ruman development as personality. In our modern society, where personality always comes first for such individuals will be no place and they will be more likely to become criminals of other not preferable elements.
At the some time, it can be argued that to much greedom in higher education ne has negative impact on other lower levels. It can be true, but , to my mind,  there thust be some other revags to make not-high professional x delcation attractive for students.
To sum it up, I bvould like to say that the idea of acceptance the same amount of male students as a female in university seems to has no sense. Obviously, there is no any convicnt reason to mare it possible, because all the people should be provided agrith equal rights, especially with fundamental ones. And right for education is among them.

They leading all deals from there and also employ local workers. Some people think that it is normal and that is the best way to set up your own business. Others, on the contrary, think that there are more disadvantages first of all, the main benefit of this plan is high income, which companies can get from low salary payment. Because of few work places people agree on any jobs in developing countries. Second is low prices, which can help to avoid economical payment for company. In contrast. There are lot of disadvantages, such as expluation of people’s who works for low salary, or other reason is monopoly, when sometimes company monopolise the countrie’s economic and start to produce low quality products, which is influenced on all prices in some sphere and government losed from that. In my opinion there are more disadvantages because companies, which move their business in developing countries is avoid to paying money to government country from where they moved on, which have negative impact on local economic. To sum up, there are more disadvantages then benefits and consequently international countries should lead their business in local countries.

Usually, it can be caused by the way we use them and the amount of time, which we spend on them.

First of all, light of the computer and  telephone screen are hurt people’s eye sight. A lot of people use mobile phones and smartphone everyday and everywhere, including the time before sleeping. Preparing for seeping is very important thing, because all this time our body (including eyes) relaxs. However, using the phone before going to bed makes our eys work, which can cause the decreasing of the eye-sight. In addition, it can cause problems with sleeping, due to the fact, that our brain can’t relax too. This problem can be solved by making some exercizes for eyes every hour after using smartphone or computer. Also, people should reduce time, which is spent for devices.

The second problem can be caused by the wrong position in front of a computer. Nowadays, people tend to spent every day at work sitting on the computer chair. Almoust everybody can’t choose the right position to seat on it, which causes problems with the spine. Hopefully, this problem can be solved by physical exercizes. People should do them after every 45 minutes being in front of the computer screen or in the gym.

All in all, despite the benefits of modern technology, people should think about their health. These problems can be reduced by replacing the light screens to alternative type of getting information as book or newspaper.

First of all, it can cause the reduction of our vision. Children, adults and even pensioners are seating in front of screens most of the day. Whith appearance of smartphones you do not need to have a PC, you can use Internet or reed an electronic book everywhere. Also, it can damage your back. People do not realise in which position they are seating while using their phones or computers. Besides, it can cause some psychological problems, as people do not communicate in reality anymore. They prefere to be alone in their apartment, listening to their music on iPod or watching films on computer or chating with friends by mobile phones.
There are some ways which can help us to fight with those problems. To begin with, people should train their eyes every day, exercise will not take more than 5 minutes. Moreover, the new function can be included in the phones - it will turn off for several minutes, if it was used more than 45 minutes (to give your eyes a rest). Also, for your back, your phone or computer can remind you to sit right or to go for a walk, do some exercises. To increase real communication more events should be held in schools, universities, at work.
To sum up, we can't stop people from using technologies - it is a very important part of our lives. However, we can reduce the influence of them and give a piece of advice how to cope with problems.

Although this modern technology have some bad impact on the human, it is not so dangerous and there is no need in regecting a microwave. So to cope with this problem there is a need in educating people and popularisating some modern resercies. 

Secondly, people, who spend a lot of time in front of their computers can have some problems with their eyes. This problem can be solved by creating a computer or monitor which will not have such bad impact. 

Finally, modern smartphones have become a huge part of our lifes and some people are worring aout that impact that smartphones cause.

Not only in the biggest cities but all over the countries you may find shops selling delicious goods that can often be imported, which some people think is wrong, believing that food should almost entirely produced “at home”. I partly agree with that for the following reasons.

On the one hand, importing products including food ones has some benefits. From civilian perspective it is really good for it provides big variety, letting any customer get whatever they want and eat the best foods from all over the world. Also this strategy could help the government’s outside economy, because it is well known that export and import deals mean a lot in international relationships. Perhaps, having a food import deal could play a role in a future political situation with that country.

On the other hand, I can see why food import strategy has some minds against it. I have already mentioned international profits ot it, but having its own large food production would make a country more stable and independent in the eyes of others. Further more, this would mean a whole list of “pluses”, from growing employment to developments in technology of agriculture and then some.

In most cases it is often that a certain strategy can be perfect and this is one of them. Food import is different from country to country, but what is certain is that most countries do import food to some extent, which, as I see it, cannot be changed in the world we live in now.

In this essay I will prove my point of view by presenting various arguments.

To start with,the interests of all the human- beings has been varied since a long time ago. Nevertheless some members are not able to control their personal attitude towards the pastimes of their surroundings. Doubtless,many people do not fond of sport and what is more they even can not stand the idea of this very topic. To illustrate they may ask their relatives to switch off a sport TV programme regardless the fact that anybody adores that very type of sport. In addition sometimes they find it challenging to follow the whole procees of any sport game neither in real nor in virtual platforms.

At the same time people will always be surrounded by those represantatives whose tastes extremely distinguish from one to another.Consequently, in this case what is significant to remember is the evidence that everybody should be tolerant concerning the treatment to different stuff. On the top of it if a person believes that one interest is either absolutely unworthy or is something like a waste of time so they should keep such attitude closer to their chests. Owing to the fact that a modern society is based on such components as the respect, the comprehension and compassion it is really relevant to express any views accurately. Because sometimes there is a risk to offense a human and his personal interests.

To conclude,there is a well- known proverb which can be an example of my personal attitude towards the main statement. It sounds like that: ""Many people- many minds"" and means that on the one hand people may proclaim that watching sports is useless but on the other hand for me and for many other sport fans the feeling towards the sport events means much more.",65,2,1

The underground route in London is by for the longest, while Tokyo subway provides the highest amount of oassengers by transport per year.

The first subway was opened in London in 1863, were 394 kilometres in route and was I pushed by 775 millions of people per year. Compare to this, Paris underground, founded in 1900, was almost half shorter, but allowed significantly more passengers to transport (1191). Tokyo railway, opened in 1927, was only 155 kilometres on route but, compare to previous system, helped to travel to almost 2000 millions passengers. 
In the second part if the 20th century, there were founded another three major railway systems, which although had significantly worse harasteristics. The Washington Dc system, opened in 1976, was 126 km in distance and had only 144 millions of passengers every year. The figures for the rest two undergrounds, Koyoto and Los Angeles, founded in 1981 and 2001, were considerably less than even in Washington DC. Koyoto subway had the shortest route, only 11 km, and the lowest rate of passengers ( 45 million per year). For Los Angeles figures were slightly better: 23 kilometres of route and 50 millions of people, using transport per year.

There are two different opinions. Some people think that characteristics given to us when we are just in mother's bully influence out lifes. Some people do not think so. Personally I think that both characteristics influence our personality and life. I believe that when you are just in a childhood, you behave like father or mother. In my opinion girls behave like fathers and boys - like mothers. But if you do not like some characteristics, you are able to change them. Saying ""you"" I mean ""parents"", because if parents would like to improve some characteristics of their child, of course, they can. For example, one of my favorite films is ""Elf"". The movie is about a boy, who was alone, his father did not knows about film and kind elfs brought him up. A very funny Christmas carrol. But once, the boy met his father, they became a family and there was a very funny moment when they were sleeping in the same position. Of course, this is not personality or development, but I am talking about the fact, that we are all similar to our parents. And what about characteristics? When I was a child I was behaving like my uncle. A child was taking the same way as a so yeared man. Some years when mother told me about this fact I couldn't believe, but now I am sure she was telling the truth. But if you would like to bring up a real personality, you do not have to give up at your first steps. It is possible to make some changes in the characteristics we were born wife. But if you need to have a real result, you have to work at your baby's personality at its first steps. I know a real situation when a woman did not like her husbands personality, but they were in love and had a baby. This baby, this girl was becoming similar to father. And the woman decided to work on the problem and solved it!

From my point of view, by increasing the number of sports clubs and other facilities can help to people improve their health.
First of all, when people have a lot of opportunities to do sport training each of them may find a type of activity that he likes the most. People are more motivated when they enjoy doing sports than in the situation when they do not like it. Secondly, if a person find kind of sport interesting for himself, he will meet a lot of people with the same interests. The satisfaction of team work is huge, teammates may become friends. Moreover, there is a strong motivator which can help to improve public health, it is public opinion. Influence of public opinion is significant, that is why when your friends start to go to the gym, you want to do that too.
However, the growth of the number of sports facilities may not be as effective as we think. There are a lot of other measures to improve public health. Firstly, advertising today has a power to control people's decisions. In that case, social advertisments with examples of harmful for health choices, such as junk food, smoking and couch potato type of lifestyle may influence on people. Seminars and TV-programs about advantages of the healthy lifestyle may help to improve public health, too.
To conclude, improvment of the public health is very important issue to discuss and increasing the number of sports facilities can be helpful measure to solve this problem.

This essay is going to describe a main problems and try to find out a solution for them.
To begin with, the most popular drawback of using modern gadgets is conected with eyes. Children and working people spend hours sitting in front of the digital screen. It makes their eyes tired and when it happens days by days it can lead into permanend lose of sight level.
What is more, people nowadays use phones and headphones a lot. These gangets produse microwaves to conect with each other and world wild web. These microwaves harmfully influence on brain if you use gadgets regularly.
In addiction, children these day spend much more time playing computer gamer rather than outdoor ones. That is why they are less sportive and sometimes even have some serious problems with their back.
However, tecnologies develop not only in the way of usage, but also in a safety way. Produsers today are thinking about harmfull effects of their products and alway try to reduse them. In some morden countries this problem is even regulated by laws. If we are talking about problems, that were mensioned in this essay, it must be said that screens are getting safer for eyes every year and microwaves and redusing as hardly as it is possible. If we are talking about sitting lifestyle of children, it should be solved only by their parends. Sports these day are developing as well.

I strongly believe that this statement is true. If all people will have an opportunity to use some sport facilities in their local area and do it cheaply of for free almost every one will do some sport activities at least once a week and improve their health. Firstly, increasing of the number of sport facilities will give people an opportunity to visit gym of some sport section near their home. There is a big poblem that people can not do sports because of distance to sport facilities, especially in small towns. For example, many children and teenagers use to do sports in governmental sport centres in their local area because it is near their home and free. Secondly, increasing of the number of sport facilities will give people a chance to choose any kind of sports they like. Many people avoid doing sports because they can not find sport activities according to their phisical features and tastes. Also many people do not doing sports because of big number of people in sport facilities in their town. Increasing the number of sport facilities and building big sport centres with many kinds of sports will solve the problem. For example, such sport centres are very popular in big cities where it is very difficult to find good sport facilitie. Finally, increasing the number of sport facilities is really very good way to improve public health by increasing of number of people doing sports. There is many advantages of such idea and I think that government will play a very big role in increasing of the number of sport facilities.

It is easy to find fresh, just introducted, film or music album in social networks and special downlouding sites. But it is so hard to find person, who can be responsible and punished for this. Is it right? Musical and film industry’ product should be free or we have to punish people, who make pirat copies?

There are two sides of the question. In my opinion, making copies is illegal business. Person, who make money by this must be punished. To do music album, to take videos and new film is not free too. You need in a huge amount of money to pay all professionals: composers, scenarists, operators, casting-directors, artists, producers. And this will be stange if you would present your job for free. If you are not a millioner and philantrop, of course.

Pirat coping and sharing should be punished because it help for plagearism. People can downloud music, to make a little changes and then to say that they did it themselves. So, using platforms such as Apple Music (AppStore) is more safer than Vlc player, for examples. Many producers also use YouTube official channels for introduction new clips, videos or just a music treck.

On the other hand, pirate sharing of new films and music help it become more popular. Great amount of social networs users do reposts, send a messages for friends with new song of their favourite singer. The more reposts - the more audience, listeners and followers. It is the main aim of all artists, isn’t it?

To sum up everything, I can say that I agree that pirate coping and sharing music or films on the Internet should be punished. It is not right behind the creator. In my opinion, people, who made something new, should get money, but not man who just copied this.

Every coin has two sides and this issue has both advantages and disadvantages, that’s why I partly agree with those who support the idea about flight restriction. It is undeniable that planes are very useful for the main part of people all over the world. First of all, this type of transport saves a lot of time because of speed. This time can be spent on important activities and to make one’s life better. Moreover, according to some researches conducted by special laboratories, planes are the most safe transport from those which are available to the majority of people. On the other hand, air travels implies extra air pollution and have a bad influence on the process of society development. In this case, the amount of gases produced by air transport is higher than by cars or trains and it requires a lot of efforts to correct this situation. So, the decrease in planes usage will lead to decrease a spending on the maintain of environment situation and in the amount of money that citizens have to pay as a taxes. Secondly, not every environmental problem can be solved easily should think about future generations. To conclusion it can be said that considered issue is very controversial and the possible solution has positive and negative features but I suppose that the trend of using planes will remain in the future.

The purpose of this essay is to discuss different aspects of problem with teaching a foreign language in the modern schools.
  To begin with that it is well-known fact that nowadays majority of schools offer opportunities for children and young people to learn not only state language, but also to learn different foreign languages. However, there is question: when is better to begin to learn languages other countries. Some people think that it is normal than children began to study foreign language than they are in the secondary school. One argument in support of this statement that children became (after primarily schools) all neccessary basic knowledge to this time and they are ready to get knowledge in other disciplines (includes also one or sometimes two foreign languages). 
  On the other hand, if one based on the latest exploriation, it should be said that it is more profitable not only for practic language skills, but also for children’s memory than they began to learn foreign language in primarily school. The second think that needs to be said in support learning foreign languages in first 4 or 5 classes is that children in age 6-10 years-old more active and they can remember more information and different tasks. In addition, they feel themselves better to learn something new and don’t have fairs for speak with other people. They are very talkative in this age (6-10 years-old) and have intersed to improve their skills next.
   Moreover, it will be unfair not to mention the fact that if children began to study foreign languages in primarily school, they can to learn also other languages in the future in the secondary school. An example to this statement can be served pupils, who learn English since first class, have more opportunite to be successful in language than children who don’t study languages. 
  Taking everything into a consideration, it can be said, that it is very neccassary today having different skills in language, because if children know more than  one language they can be more successfull in work and in life in general. For this reason, it is better to began studying foreign language  in primarily school.

Some people argue whether there are the disadvantages or the advantages. In my opinion, in this case the advantages significantly outweigh the disadvantages and explanation of this will be discussed in this essay. The positive side of such situation can be considered in two levels: for companies and employers, and for citizens of developing countries, where companies move. As it is known average salaries in developed countries are in high position in comparison with developing countries. Consequently for companies it is better to pay less to employees and get the same amount of income. So decision to move to poorer countries to use cheaper work force seems sensible. Also, a lot of materials are come from developing countries, therefore being doing business there is more effective and again cheaper. On the citizens’ level there are extremely good job prospects for employees in fact that in developing countries the level of unemployment takes high meanings. Due to international companies this problem can be solved and most employees may allow themselves more than they could. Some people have different view on this problem and claim that such interventions can destroy economies of developing countries with taking most employees positions. In my opinion, international companies are not harmful, otherwise they help states to cope with unemployment, investing money in these countries. In conclusion, despite the fact that international companies may be harmful for economics of developing countries, they can provide citizens of these countries with job. Also, there are visible advantages for companies because of cheaper work force and materials.

Personaly, I agree with this statement for several reasons. Firstly, with the development of technology peolpe faced such problem as harmful computer games. What I mean is that some computer games can cause a lot of harm to phisical and phsicological state of a teenager. Playing in cruel computer games without stopping, young people become unable to distinguish between online world and reality and it can result in committing a crime. Secondly, nowadays parents tend to trust teenagers to chose how to spend their free time and they also do not check with whom their child hangs out. Such a modern gesture results in the fact that a teenager may be envolved in some criminal community.
In my opinion the problems presented below may be solved easily. Firstly, the government should prohibit any kind of cruel online computer games which can cause a harm to a teenager. Secondly, parents should be more envolved in theit child's life. So, that they would know with whom their child spends his or her free time. Also, some government projects may be presented in order to tell all people how important this problem is and that we should unite together in order to solve this problem.

First of all, it is not a secret that telephone mobiles, which we use everyday, produce radiowaves. This waves are the reason of heart desieses. Many of experiements represented  incredible results, where participants were divised in two groups: using and not using mobile phones for two months. Obviously, people from the first group had better results after several tests, which states heart work.

What is more, modern technology has a great impact on people’s lifestyle. The addiction to technical devices makes individuals lazier, less hard-working and can cause not only physical problems, but also mental. Therefore, such a lifestyle is the reason of depression, apathy. If there is something, that tales control over our lives, it always makes us feel miserable.

There are a lot of people who clime that athlete's ban should be more strongly (for hole life of athlet). While another people consider that athletes should be banned only for 2 years. In this essay I would like to discuss these points of view and give my own opinion.
Firstly, I want to start by saying that in contemporary world hire sport cannot be without medical suggest. We know that athletes has a lot of risk in their job. Sport is draconian travmatic. Thats why athlets very often need to medical help. And sometimes medicaments that were possible and legal, became illegal drugs. For example, such situation with russian athletes before Summer Olimpic Games in 2016. Mildronat suddenly became an illegal drug. As we can remember, huge number of Russian athletes became banned. I think that this example illustrates that sometimes athletes use illegal drugs not spesially. There is no doubt that in this situation sportsmen cannot be banned for the rest of their lives.
However, we know a lot of examples of spesial using illegal drugs. Sportsmen do it, because they want to become stronger. It is not honestly for enother athletes, because they think that they compite with clean sportsmen. These arguments provide people, who clime that athletes, who use illegal drugs, must be banned from competitions for hole lives. Another point, that they admire, is that illegal drugs are very dangerous for sportsmen health.
In my opinion, I strongly believe that such situation is different and individuality. One athlete should be banned for all life, another for 2 years. It depends on situation.
To sum up, I can say that nowadays there are a lot of illegal drugs in sport and sports federations or antidoping federations should solve this problem honestly.

I totally disagree with this point of view. To my mind, there are a lot of other things which pollute our planet more and less important for society. For example, it is uneffective plants and so on. I recon, state should make plant more inviromentally-friendly and it help more then to reduce the amount of air ravel. Moreover, I strongly believe that people can create new technologies for air travel and they decrease emission of plan of, what will be really successful, find new type of power.

Some people can say that there are other ways of transport and they more inviromentaly friendly. However, I do not think that this types is less polluted. All form of transport have many problems but I think that air traveling is the best way in any condition.

As far as I am concerned, social media are relevant for the knowledge you are getting from the news, communities and so on. First of all, having information from the Internet can help you to from your background experience and make your own point of view on the life. In particular, watching useful applications and videos on the social media can support you in your daily life, study and work. Besides, getting the last news you are getting additional topics to discuss with your friends. It can be a helpful thing that will allow you to communicate with more people and to be on the same wave with them. Finally, it is a good way to share something useful with others and perhaps to meet new friends on the Internet. Nevertheless, gaining information from the social media can have a bad impact. Some people have a bad influence and can teach you something horrible. Moreover, some people tend to manipulate others and can easily abuse you un their purpose. In this case, the entertainment is the best option for social media uses. It is a great pleasure to relax after job and play some games on the Internet.

For my opinion, it is bad to copy, but on the other side I know that we can not live another way. So, I really want to explain why we should try to protect art industry.

Firstly, I want to say that it is illegal to copy and share files which are not original. And we have certain anount of low which says that we will be punished. There are lows about originality, they protect authour from illigal copyind. For example, I remember that when I made my own movie for university someone copyed it and shared with others. Of course, I was in shock and feel uncomfortable. So, we can only imagine how it stresful and how mach money lose some producers because other people share their masterpiece with others and donot even pay them. I do believe that our low should punish that people. We have a lot of opportunities to find people who does smth illigal, it is not so unimaginable. And that is my other suggestion to the Government. We should follow people who put that on Internet and do not pay money for that or do not have a permition to do it.

On the other side, It seems quite unreal because it is an easy navy and we can downland it free. Not everyone have enough money to pay for everything they want.

But I do not know people who really wanted something and did not get it. My uncle, for enstance, tried as hard as could be to get new painting. So same, should do we.

I personally prefer pay for everything that made with love , and whem smb spend time on it. Musicians spend a lot of days doing their own songs.

All in all, there are different lows which are protect all kind of work. If we were not pay for any of them we are ruin there lives because they do not have enough money to do something pleasure. So people who won’t pay should be punished.

A lot of people watch films to relax or to get new knowledge. Many of them watch British or American films more othen than others which are produced in their own countries. It is interesting to understand the reasons of this common choice and to try to think if goverment should change the situation.

There are many reasons for such a high level of popularity what British or American films have. To begin with, these countries started this kind of industry many years ago and created some traditions of making films, which others have to copy. In addition, the UK and USA are the richest countries all over the world, and they could afford some special effects in their movies, which is one of the main factors for some people. Moreover, the most talanted actors want to join American or British films because of the largest sum of money given there. Thus, it is also a financial problem.

There could be different points of view if locally produced films should be supported. As for me, I agree with the idea that government should give the aid to directors to improve their movie business. Firstly, local film production could helpthe country to show its cultural features and therefore share them with the others. Secondly, these growth of film production would help people to respect their own country. Thirdly, some tralanted local directors could become competitors for their collegues in Great Britain or America, and they would have to create their films better. Thereby, the common level of film quality would be higher.

Even watching Tv and live sports events can be beneficial. Numerous people strongly support this idea when some of them are against it and regard this activity as useless one. What about me, I support the first point of view.

Generally, some people are convinced that watching TV programs is a waste of time indeed. Sports events are not an exception. During this period of time, a person can do something more useful and practical: cleaning the house or walking a dog. Moreover, they are sure that it can be bad for health. To illustrate, during a penalty or when a player is suspended or even dropped, the tension rises. As a result, a person watching it starts gesticulating more actively and shouting to express his emotions. As a consequence, he becomes vulnerable to various heart problems, such as heart attacks. Respectively, it may have grave aftermaths. But at the same time, it is a wonderful oppurtunity to express all the emotions, both positive and negative ones. Nevetheless, the disadvantages are plentiful.

But it is only one side of the coin. Due to sports events, people participate in them to certain extent. They are involved in the process of the game and pay no attention to day-to-day problems. Different matches help them to change more or less their routine. Addutionally, it may be so exciting that finally person wants to become a player of the team and take part in this sport. Definitely, it is a step of great significance that has a positive impact on a health. Although, it is important to remember that the risk of traumas and injuries is also exist. None should neglect his health as it is the most precious thing that we have. The last but not the least is the argument that sport events may play an education role. In my opinion, if person watches it, especially in foreign language, he can broad his vocabulary with sport terms and definitions. Probably, sooner or later, there will be a necessity to use them.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that effect of watching sports events is a debatable issue. But I am sure that perks outweigh drawbacks if person does it carefully and not become a reckless fan.",65,2,0

Some people disagree with this decision because of many reasons.
First of all, there is a group of people, who stands for free access to any art. The main function of film or a song is to contain a special message, and the more people get this message the better for song or film. Actually, it is an old tradition of distribution songs or fairy tales from one person to another, from one speaker to another. Personally I agree with such method, because it has positive effect. When people share ideas, then they can create something new and different restrictions stop the process of creation.
In addition, many experts claim that it is hard to stop and control the process of making copies and how many people download them. Moreover, it will be very expensive and, as a result, the price for a disk will dramatically rise. It will lead to decreasing of revenue for film producers and film companies.
Also, if they try to control distribution of copies and rise the price, there is a probability that the author of the film or song will not get this money, becouse it will be spended on the control system. A few years ago there was a scientific work about Hollywood’s economic. The results show, that the most important field of economic were selling of pop-corn and Coca-Cola. It practically means that there is no reason for implementing restrictions of distributing copies.
In conclusion, many people do not believe that it is possible to punish “free-riders”, as it will be extremely hard, difficult and expensive to find them at least.

First of all, the most significant point is that the greatest amount of books of any type is produced in the USA. The smallest rate of sellings is in the UK. The main feature is that in all countries the market of electronic books is lower than the market of print books in 2014, and then, turning to 2018, predictions are different. For example, there would be more eBooks in the USA and the UK in 2018 (10,5 billion US Dollars and 2,3 billion Dollars respectively).
However, in Germany and China the amount of eBooks would not grow rapidly: sells in Germany would extend from 1 to 1,5 billion US Dollars, and in China the growth will amount 0,5 billion Dollars too.
To summarize, the situation with the book market in four countries is different, though it is important to emphasize that in the UK the correlation in amount is not significant and it would be stable for the period of four years.

Others believe that there is nothing awful in making it free.
To my personal points of view, people should pay for the music or films that professionals do. Firstly, pirate copies are not allowed to use. Moreover, it can lead to serious problems with the government, you can even be sentences to certain years. Secondly, we basically live in a modern world where labour should be paid money. Also, people work as hard as it is possible, they do not sleep, do not see their families in order to make a good quality product for the society which should respect not only itself, but others as well!
However, there exist another opinion that I do not have to pay for these things that are called art. Firstly, if I cannot pay for the music I like because of lack of money why is it impossible to listen to the versions that were copied? Secondly, why people should pay for the music that are free on the Internet nowadays? The same thing about movies.
Anyway, if you do not have money go and earn some. If a person is really fond of listening of music or watching TV he will find a solution to buy something she or he likes because we live in the 21 century where human rights are respected. Furthermore, price on music and films is not so extremely high. Everyone can easily afford it.
To sum everything up, I am strongly convinced with the fact that human beings must respect modern rules and live according to the law. Actually, such things as music or films motivate you, make you dream and broaden horizons for sure. Why should not we pay for it?

Such trend has rather more benefits than disadvantages. Firstly, as for developing countries, where the business is moved to it’s citizens would start getting more and more work places. Such trend leads to people getting more money and wealth and as a result the quality of life in such countries grows along with the economy in total. Moreover, for the international company moving it’s business to developing and poor country means hiring cheaper labor force as people in such countries don’t make a lot of money. Such process results in company’s productivity and also the prices of the product might go down as the labor force is cheap and this is appears to be a significant advantage for the consumers. Furthermore it migh result in compary having more consumers. On the other hand, there is also a number of disadvantages of such process. First of all, it might lead to a new some kind of slavery. As the labor force in such countries is cheap and people know a little about they rights or there is even no low regulating the working hours and condition. As a result, the employer might make people long more hours which results of their health. In addition such process of moving business and factories to poorer countries reflects and distracts that country’s “natural” ways of development. For example, people stop doing agriculture, cultivating, farming and start to work on factories while developing agriculture could lead the country further. In conclusion, the proces of moving business to developing countries has both advantages and disadvantages. However, benefits of this development outweight the disadvantages.

The fastest way to travel anywhere is to travel by plane. But there is one issue that makes travelling by plane ecological unfriendly, one plane pollute air as thousand cars. The questio is if it is beneficial to us, humans to travel by planes or we have to reduce the amount of air travel as it will to a disaster in future. 

I agree with the position that air travel and the usage of planes should be reduced. First of all, the ecological situation on our earth is cticical. We destroy forests which produce oxygen for our lives and which can filtrate and reduce the proportion of harmful gases and CO2 in the atmosphere. And when we travel by plane, we make an extra pollution which can lead to some ozon holes in the atmosphere which can destroy the life on the earth. Secondly, there are thousands of planes in the air each second. Some of them are even without passangers or half-full with them which also leads to extra pollution without any sceme.


However, some people claim that cars and factories produce much more pollution and planes are more ecofriendly then other transport because there are no so many of them. I disagree with such people because in comparison with 20 years ago, today there are much more planes and plane manufacturs still want to better the characteristics of their products but not to reduce their emissions.

To sum up, I am sure that we should reduce and controll air travelling because it is too harmful for our planet. I think that the best way to reduce emitions is to make eco-friendly planes.

On the one hand, nowadays there are significant climate changes on the Earth such as global warming which can have disasterous effect on people is lives. As it has been proven that air planes contribute to air pollution, companies should make special research programmes, in order to create an innovative, engine which will reduce the air pollution created by planes and other means of air transport. On the other hand, it can be seen that air travel is unnecessary in the modern world. At the same time, I disagree with people who think that nowadays the are a lot of unnecessary air travel. All the flight are useful and needed. For example, it is very difficult to go to another place by train or by bus if it is situated too far from here. Moreover, people usually try to arrive to the destination as soon as possible, thus they use air planes, which have a faster speed. In the addition, it governments impose taxes on air travel, it will lead to a great increases in prices of most of the goods, it can be noticed that it will have a negative impact especially on ordinary consumers. Moreover, if governments introduce laws in order to reduce the number of air travel, there will be a very long traffic jams on road through all over the world. It will increase the costs of delivery of goods. If ordinary people can not travel by planes, they couldn’t visit other countries which are located too far from they homes. In conclusion, I really believe that it is unnessary to impose taxes and special laws on air travel because the results of this can be crucial for ordinary people.

Does it mean that such sportsmen should be banned from competing for a limited or unlimited period of time?
On the one hand, some people tend to think that banning for a short or limited period (for example, 2 years) allows such athletes to realise their mistakes, thus giving them an opportunity to achieve their goals in the nearest future. Moreover, banning for the rest of their lives might have a negative impact on their career and reputation.
On the other hand, such method is not the panacea to the problem as nobody guarantees that a sportsman would not use illegal drugs again. Besides, it wouldn't help to take control of those who is trying to neglect the law or has already made attempts to do it.
In my view, athletes caught using drugs should be strictly punished and banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives because in this case such a fair punishment which meets the requirement of moral circumstances, will not let other sportsmen follow in their footsteps.

Some peolple believe that people, who illegally copy the private products and download to the Internet, are criminals. I definitely agree with this statement and I will prove it in this essay.
Firstly, not only producers of films and music lose their money. Government also suffer from illegal copies, because of people have a free access for ententainment, huge companies will go away from nationcl market. As the result, the government will have lack of taxes. For example, many Americans firms don’t enter to Russian market, because russian authorities don’t deal with illegal products
Secondly, this situation strictly influences social habits and behaviour. If people have a chance to watch films and listen music at home, they will stop going to cinemas and conserts. Therefore, social communication will reduce seriously. 
However, others think that illegal pirate copies is good opportinity to educate and develop as the other parts of society. In my opinion, this opinion is incorrect and it causes the real problems between different social groups. Moreover, there are special state programmes and web sites, which government creates for sharing materials for poor people.
In conclusion, as some individuals continue sharing music and films, it badly effect on musicians and producers, goverments and whole society. Goverment loses additional profit from faxes, consumers doesn’t have incentive to spent money on entertainment. Political and economic leaders should change the situation in the nearest future.

Now, government want introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travels. I agree with it, because some air travels can provide to air pollution this ways of train should be laws, than now.
The first reason do it, is risk of global warming. This transport can damage our ecological situation and pollute our air. It’s lead on global warming, because it’s link with azone disbalanse on air. Now this problem is very actual. If we can stop the one reason damage out ecological area, we will can stop and other happens with some problem. Air pollution give us future risk a global warming and other ecological catastrofy. The second reason, this transport not always nessesary. There are too much people, who can chose other ways for their business traines. Some times with ways more quicly and comfortable, when traines on road way, for example, people don’t want waste their time and chose air travel on short travel. This reason is not so good, because our business are not necessary, but after it can destroy our environment area. There are a lot of other ways to train. People can used a car for exaple. It’s not so big transport that’s why it’s more safety. For this reason, in conclusion, if goverments introduce laws to reduce the amount of air ways, it’s will be helpful for us and all the Earth. Unnecessary things, such as small business travels on airline, should go in the past. Laws distanse is not a reason for air travels. We need to chose the most safety thing for usaly use.

Air travel plays an important role in our life. Everyday people use it for business and leisure. There are hundreds of airport around the world. Our environmental situation is really dangerous: there are air pollution and global warming. It causes such disasters like people’s illness because of breathing in unfresh air, exhausting nature resourses, ice melting and so on.
People can not refuse at all from plane because it is a mai features for work and business for many people. Also it is  kind of transport to do holiday. But people can limit the using of air planes. and government should control it. Governments can introduce the law which will check the amount of air travel. For example, the exceptable number for one person will be 10 air travel per year. Also government can stand the standarts for air companies. Approximately 100 plane will be per month for each company. It is about 3-4 times a day. Moreover during the year there are increasing and decreasing periods of using plane. During the holidays, especially summer holidays, there are a lot of people who want to travel. In this period government can afford more air travel than at spring.
Air travelling is very significant for people’s life so government shouldn’t forbide air travel at all but it is neccessary to control it because there are a big influence on our nature.

If we want to improve public health by increasing sport facilities, we would to build wide different facilities. Then all people can find for themselves the lovely type of sport. 


There are another ways to reach the improving of public health. To begin with government and social organisation should develop the medicine. The high level of medicine. Can provide the high level of public health. If people can get qualified help from medical workers and all medical centre will have a different types of new technology, then public healt will rise.


As for me, in my opinion, every way of improving public health is good. But we should pay attention, that we can get the best results if we combine these ways. In this case, people will take a part in different types of sport to increase own health, but people, who feel disease frequently should be deal with sport under looking of medical workers.

First of all, when people attend some sports events or just get together and watch championships online, they feel like they belong to something global. They feel connection between each other and it seems like they are one big family. They really are. Remember when in Ancient Greece Olympic games were started, wars were paused? Do you understand the great importance of it? Sports events connect people and create peace in the world.
Secondly, watching sports inspire us to create wonderful things. I mean that when you watch how sportsmen are playing and then winning the prize, you understand how really hard they worked for it, so it makes you get out of bed and you start doing sports, or you start trying to study more, or make your career grow. Sport is like art - when you watch it, you feel inspired and refreshed.
Finally, you even can make a career while watching sports! For example, you can become a sports events commentator, or a sports journalist. There are a lot of ways to find a job in sports sphere. If you are really interested in sport and you understand what it is made of, then you should not blow your chance to get in the sports industry!

Such opinion is based on the scientific research but still remains quite contradictory. 
It’s hard to argue with the fact that some personality features can be shaped throughout the whole life. The people we meet, the circumstances we’re in, the surroundings all these things on some level form our personality. Starting from family upbringing we absorb the behaviour, attitude to life, optimism or the opposite, the will to be striving for something. If certain family values are properly implemented then a person is more likely to lead an active life, not meaningless existance. His or hers lifepath will be formed by self-development. Moreover, the more experience we get the more it is possible that they have somehow changed our personality. For example, let’s take a man who has gone through a tough break up with a woman he loved truly, let’s assume that he was betrayed by her. Most people tend to close their hearts and refuse to trust anyone due to endured suffering they no longe want to feel.
Still I cannot deny that experience is not the only thing that we have a considerable influence on personality. As a matter of fact some people, fro example, without any education, brought up in troubled families, facing difficulties every step the took, nevertheless, managed to achieve fantastic results in profession, found their place under the sun, realized their ambitious, buid strong relationships. Thus, the evidence shows that there is something in them they were born with that helps them become who the have become.
Generally speaking, I do believe that personality is formed by a great range of factors. To my mind still it is the characteristics we are born with that define the personality itself and it’s future even though a gained experience is also one of the key factors.

This problem became burning nowadays.
Since ancient times people have been thinking of happiness and the ways of achieving it. No one has said certainly what happiness is yet, so there are various concepts.
Some argue that happiness is personal well-being, others claim that happiness is money. In different epoches here were special determinations of happiness. Earled people were happy if they were healthy, not hungry and could make their living.
Nowadays, people are aiming for popularity, fame, power, respect and forget about relations. Their goals are very hard to achieve, but in fact it I a false hope syndrome. Whe you are famous you are barely happy. So I strongly believe that society and mass media disorientate people who are searching happiness.
I know people who believe that happiness is harmony between a human being and nature. But if we look at the newspapers, we will see deforestation, destruction of natural habitat. So it is impossible to achieve this harmony due to modern circumstances.
Some people believe that happiness is beaty and art. But art has also become spoiled by business, so it is impossible to destinguish beauty from fake. Such problems lead to disappointment and unhappiness.
To sum up, I would like to say that it is society and mass media who make it so difficult to define happiness. Everybody could be happy in his own way, but modern life can easily make it roller with up-to-date standarts of well-being, beauty and harmony.

One of them is should male and female students work together and even more - in equal numbers. Some people lelieve that it's inappropriate , to make universities accept equal numbers of male/female students, others agree that it will improve current situation in education. 
There exist strong arguments of both sides of this disscussion, which implies that it is worth examining all points of view before reaching any conclusion. 
First of all, there is a necesity to say that one of the advantages of these type of accepting students is the equallity between men and women. Equall numbers mean equall opportunities for people, without discrimination sexes. Moreover, there is a plenty of scientist's researchs convincing that working between male and female groups of people in equall proportions gives a much more favor. Also, this type of proportion helps members of each group interact with others easily, that when there is a disproportion.
Another point of view is that such type of accepting students is useless and pointless. Supporters claim that such thing can destroy the real competition between students, which is based on knowledge, not on female / male you are or not.
Another drawback of equall accepting numbers is that it can crushed all system of university's academic freedom - government will give concrete numbers of students , who schould study in universities. And one of the most convincing arguments againts equall proportions between male/female students is that there is no any correlation or connection between knowledge and which sex do you have. And I am firmly believe in that. Since the Medievel times, people fight against discrimination, for modern society with equall rights for everybody. And for the first time, this meosure for accepting equall numbers of students seems like justice, lut it is not real suitable criteria for competition between students. There is no shame if men are good at law and women in teaching as there is no any discrimination between them in case of disproportion.
Considering all arguments , it can be concluded that the idea of universities accepting equal number of male / female students is not good of all.

If they do this, children will not allow bad genetic characteristics to influence on their lives and development. I agree with this point of view, because without competition and struggle our life is boring.
Anyway, other people believe, that genetic characteristics have much more influence on us. For example, of child are alchoholics, a child will be alcoholic too! Moreover, parents experience of child will not have much influence on this genetic characteric.
I would like to say, that I do not agree with this opinion. I am sure, that if person understands the problem and wants to solve it, he or she can do this. 
To sum up, we should do our best to achieve success and to improve our lives. You should believe in yourself and then genetic characteristics would not stop you.

And stress causes many arguments and the things can even come to the extreamely frtustrative situations. When people speak about crime the word that comes in their minds is ""the youth"". Saddly, but crime rate amoung young people is higher than ever.Their environment and the society tells them what to do and how to bee ""cool"" in someway.

The first argument is that most of them are rejected by society and to attrackt attention - they commit absurd things to say ""I'm different"".

The second argument is that young people are easily affected. The most of them see and advertising, for exaple, and they want to buy it immediately. They don't think about the consequences, but just take what they want even if it's sometimes illigally.

Thirdly, the young people's problem is sometimes ignorance. They think that they don't need the elder generation's advices and that they need to have their own experiences, but sometimes these very experiences drive to the road of drugs, guns and conflits not because they wanted to, but because of the lack of knowlegde and a massive ignorance and too much self-confidence.

To solve this problem there's the only way: education. As from parents, as from school. They must be taught how to love, how to normally communicate with people. How to make friends and one of the things that must be deffinitely taught is how to take decisions. Because many of them almost always listen to their feelings while it would be better to face these kind of things with a sense of rationality. Yhey firstly may be angry but the shoul think a lot before doing or saying something.
When we speak about these kind of things,we have to remeber to listen to each other. Not to listen to answer, but listen to understand, because many prblems wouldn't evenexist, such as the generation problems and the same crimes, if people especially the youth would listen to each other, would try to understand and walk in each other shoes.",70,2,6

Adults were 60 per cent of Italy population and 46 per cent in Yemen. Old people (60 plus years) was a quater of Italy population and just 4 per cent in Yemen.
This could be explained by differences between Italy and Yemen life levels. Yemen is a poor Aisian country and for this type of states huge amount of children is usual. Italy is developed European country with small amount of children in total population, but big of adults and old men. Obviously, part of old men will increase and part of children- decrease in both countries.
This conclusions can be proved by projections for 2050. Total amount of children will be decreased: to 37 per cent in Yemen and 11 per cent in Italy. The number of old people will be increased to almost a half of population in Italy and only to 5 per cent in Yemen. It is connected with bigger life countinuing in Italy.

Moreover, this number increase gradually, unfortunatelly. In this essay I try to provide some possible causes of this fact and give some solutions to prevent it in future.
It is clear from criminal statistics that in most cases of crime, the young people participate in it and there are some causes on it.Some of them grow up in a poor family and they want to get a money. Also, one of the causes may be the environment, where this people grew up. Some scientists claims that it is the most possible causes.For example, wnen one of tne member of family was in prisoner.Another assumption is that the desire to crime is innate and it is in their nurture.
I can provide some solution, which will be helpful for prevent it. For instance, the young people should have more sport sections.It may be interesting, therefore there are a different opportuinities for competition. Such team sports like football, basletball and etc. Moreover, parents and teachers should pay more attention for teenagers and control them in a good sence. They can suggest to their children and studients read more books.
In my view,the young people shoud recognise with help of their parents, teachers, books or other resources that do crime is not good for theyselfs and for society in general. The teenagers should have be more busy in his life and in this cases in they head won't be thoughts, connecting with crimes.",65,2,0

Today's pharmacy allows athletes achieve great results in a short period of time and without difficult exercises. That is why some people claim that such kind of athlets should be banned from competing in professional championships at all but the others say that the period when one can not take part in competiton should be limited. 
First of all, the people who claims on disqualification of the athletes who was caught on using drugs break down the spirit of honest and clear competition. That is why, they can not be judged the same way as others. Because of being liers and cheaters such athletes should be grounded and they won't be able come back to professional sport.
It is difficult for some people to accept such point of view that is why they argued that we can not forbide athletes who used illegal drugs to take part in professional competitions forever because it is their profession and we can not let them live without job for the rest of their life because of the one mistake. But such opponents do not take in mind the fact that some illegal drugs lead to unacceptable changes in the athlet's body and that is why they can not be judged like the other who do not use illegal drug's.
It is clear for me that people who think that athlets should not be banned forever can not be absolutely right because sport means honesty and true spirit of competition. If we deny it we deny the definition of professional sport.
In conclusion it is better to say that sport is such kind of human activity that do not accept any kind of lie and cheating. So, illegal drugs should be banned and the sportmen who was caught on taking them also should be disqualified.

Nowadays not everyone have this possibilities. On the other hand, preason could make people a social. So people of ther prison just cannot emagine their life without prison.

Is it true or not?

There is no doubt that in some cases the widespread use of modern technology may cause health problems. The most obvious situation that can prove this thesis is eye deseases. Nowadays the majority of people has some problems with their eyes because of the use of gadgets. They cannot live without their mobile phones and laptops and never leave these gadgets alone. For the same reason people may have headaches. What is more, people  nov have a tendency to spend their free time on home laying on the sofa and watching a TV or playing computer games. Thus, they don’t go for a walk and don’t do any sport activity, they only become fat.

Moreover, technology has a goof aspects too, if people would use it correctly. Moreover these problems will be reduced. For instance, people should prefer long walks to using their gadjets. They should be active in their lives. In addition, they must understand the importance of time limit of using their gadjets. What is more parents should teach their children to spend their spare time with friends or relatives. Going to picnics or going to a little trip can save all this negative situation.

Tu sum up, using of technology nay cause a negative effects, but people can reduce it and find a perfect solution for this problem.

There are a few reasons for that. In this essay I will try to give causes of this tandency and solution that people who are around youngsters chould use to make sure that this trend will stop developing.
Firstly, nowadays almost all teenagers use social networks that are full of violance and cruelty. There are a lot of people in the internet who try to bring children to illigal groups who make crimes every day. Young people are very sensitive and easily manapulated which leads to them joining these groups. What is more, news that are shown in television, unfourtunatly, can be an example for children that are have, maybe, some mental problems. These kind of reports could potentially be the reason why teenagers can have thoughts and ideas of committing some sort of crime. Moreover, children have computer games that are often very cruel and teenagers learn from them about violance.

Nevertheless, there are always ways to prevent or even solve this problem. Parents, for instance, can garde their children from social media till certain age. It is possible that teens without it won't even have an idea how to commit a crime. Another approach to this problem is for teachers in schools and , if it is neccessary, in universities create a subject from which teenagers will learn that violance is never a solution for any problem, that everything can be talked out.

To sum up, it is true that young people make a lot more crimes than before because of social networking sites that were invented or bad examples in real life,however, we can prevent it and make sure that children are safe.",65,2,0

Business organisations are not the exception so the idea of transferring international productions and their business goes from strength to strength.  However, it is believed that if has its own drawbacks. First of all, the movements of developed companies to poorer countries give great possibilities to their local habitants. It is obvious that people would able to find proper work for themselves and it can make the situation of poor families much better. Furthermore, businesses of international companies gives wealth and prosperity for that country in a whole way. It is able to deal with unemployment in the country, to bring up the socio-economic status of their sitizens and what is more such business development can influence on the countries’ infrastructure and transport system. On the other hand, there is an option that the disadvantages of this development can be superior. Firstly, for the majority of workers who should obligatory follow to poorer countries it becomes hard to change their life style to which they get used. Secondly, it makes a hard and difficult way to leave a strong company on its first locations. The head of the company should have a strong team to deal with business in both countries they situated. Finally, sometimes it takes too much affort and investment to change the location of business and to save the previous amount of production. In my point of view, though such kind of development can sound difficult and for someone even unbelievable, it still gives a possibility for poor people to change their lifestyle to a better conditions. In conclusion, it I worth, to say that such changes always depend on the possibilities of company. However, we should not forget about their main aim and benefit, that is not only to find more workers or cheap resources but also to develop the wealth and prosperity for poorer countries.

I utterly agree with such a point of view.
To begin with, internet piracy belongs to a crimerate. In this way, people who buy it’s production support online robbers and provide them with money. So they become the participants of the illegal act. Moreover, such purchasors increase the social acceptance of these unjustified accidents. So the number of pirates and their clients has been consistently rising.
After that, why should producers invest in media when their profit has been permanently decreasing? In essence, the public just take their money. If such a tendency continues, then people limit their investments, there will appear a lack of financial resources and the quality of products will dramatically drop. This means illegal buyers damage economic and cultural spheres in general.
By the way, nowadays governments tend to start punishing breaking the law online actions. It relates to posts and cites in social networks. Breaking rights of the investors is also a crime. So if the government punishes one illegal actions why doesn’t it do the same to the other. That is ease of unjustice.
All in all, internet users who buy pirate products break the rights of the official dealers and steal their money. It is probable to be a drop of the media industry. So the goverment should follow the justice and support the producers.

To my mind, there should not be official restrictions from our government, but there should be inner moral rules about what somebody can or cannot do.
Firstly, I have to say that nobody can stop our imagination creating different ideas, and government restrictions will not make us do it. They can only make some types of arts illegal, but it does not mean that these types of arts will die out. If government gives us freedom to express our ideas, there will be more orginized events and festivals. In this way government will show that it trusts it's nation.
But I should notice that some types of arts cannot be shown to the children, because it may hurt their feelings or minds or be really unacceptable for this little age. I want to say that we should protect young consiousness from harmfull effect.
Besides, I believe that expressing and watching are different things, that we cannot combine in our discussion. I guess that everybody has a right to express what he thinks or feels, but everytime a person should remember that he can upset his relatives or friends. Everybody has different views on music, politics, art. We should be tollerant and respect an opposite point of view.
To sum it all up I want to say that everybody has to dicide for himself if he can express something, which is inside of him, or cannot. For me, it is more important to have inner restrictions than have useless government rules which try to control our modern art.

This essay will analyze the main health problems, that can be caused by use of smartphones, computers, etc. and develop a probable solution to them. At first, some health problems will be observed and then the potential solution will be described. 

To start with, many people are keen on modern technology and gadgets. They spend too much time looking at their smartphones or computer’s display. This leads to the harmful consequences mostly, related to the quality of their vision. But the worsening of the vision is not the last problem with intense usage of gadgets. While using them people are usually sitting somewhere, thus, decreasing their physical activity. 

The solution of these problems should not restrict or substituntinlly the usage of modern technology. Potential solution can use those gadgets to reduce the harmful consequences for the health. For instance, the administration of a city can make a mobile application with some tours ant quests that require people to go outside and have a rest, sometimes using their gadget for navigation or as a source of information about an interesting place or a building in their city. 

To conclude, it is necessary to point out that modern technology is an essential part of our life now and the health problem, that it causes, have to be solved more intensively, because the usage of it will only increase in the future.

Others are sure that such sportsmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will examined both points of view carefuly.
Personally I believe that athletes cought using illegal drugs should be punished by banning from competing professionally for no more then 2 years. Firstly, it is obviously for me that stricter punishment may be too cruel and violent. We cannot prohibit a sportsman to promote the deed of his life. Secondly, I believe that this ban will help to make the person better and this sportsman will not try illegal drugs anymore.
Anyway, there are a lot of people who do not share this point of view. They argue, that people do not change. The athlete who tried illegal drug one time would do another time. The second vital idea is that such violent punishment as prohibition to compete professionally during the rest of the life will stop other athletes from competing unfair. The fact is, one example may show what can occure, if you break the rules.
To conclude, I would like to say, that the problem of punichng the athletes, caught using illegal drugs is very actual and acute. In my opinion, such sportsmen should be banned for a limited period, because stricter punishment may be too violent and do not stop other athletes from breaking the prohibition.

The first and the main point to opposite the preview statement is that biologically for different sex consuitable different kinds of work. While girls enter the phylosophy, psyhology or sociology faculties, boys prefer machine and technical specializations. Girls are interested in arts, music and literature and boys are crazy about computers and other technical things which are often difficult for understanding for so many women.
The second point to opposite this is that to get the same number of different sex student is not rational and impossible just because of different proportion of male and female in every city. By this way there will be less students in universities and less educated people in country that can’t be an advantage.
But from the other side, I can guess that this kind of universities’ accepting students can be really pleasure. On the directing faculty, for example, people can exchange their experience and see some situations as for women side, as for man. There are more chances to make a good, interesting for everybody film.
In conlution I want to say that practice of the same proportion of accepting male and female students has more disadvantages than advantages because of many features and preferences of these both sex. But sometimes it can be really helpful in work to have the same number of male and female people because of opportunity to experiences exchange.

Some of them are global warming and air pollution. There is an opinion that planes rise the level of pollution and contribute global warming. Some people think that to solve this problem gevernment should decrease the amount of not essential travels for business and rest. Other people consider it too strict. 
There are several reasons why such measure should not be taken. First of all, most people travel by plane because they want to go to another country and there is no other opportunity to get there by another way. However, such flights might be unpopular and as a result unnecessary for the society in general, for example if it is not a season for going in this country. But those people just probably cannot have a vocation in another part of the year. That is why if a government prohbits these travels, it will be unfair in attribute to such people as everyone has a right to travel. 
As for business, using a plane might be the only way of transportation goods, for instance, as well. In this case a businessman just cannot cancel it. Although, there are some things which could be done to improve the situation. Government could suggest some other more efficient ways of transportation. For example, if there is a little number of things which should be delivered, they could be sent to place where there is enough number of them and after that they all could be transported by a plane.

In contrast, demand for electricity took the highest point at 20000. Summer demand started at 19000 and the winter demand at 35000. In winter the demand for electricity rapidly increased from 6:00 to 21:00. Also the summer line fluctuated from 9:00 to 24:00.
Secondly, the pie chart shows that the highest proportion of electricity is used for heating rooms and water. The second place took ovens, kettles and washing machines. The lowest percentage of electricity is used for vacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools.

The statistics was collected in 2012.

It is immediately apparent that the group of men at the age of 16-24 spent much more time doing sport than any other group. Comparing to the same age group of women, they did sport roughly twice as much time as women did. Thereafter, at the age of 25 men reduced the time they did sport significantly. The amount of time men did sport at the age of over 45 declined slowly but surely. The decrease of the amount of time women did sport was not so rapid, it fell quite gradually. We can also see that women older than 75 spent the least amount of time doing execises. Interestingly enough that the time men and women spent on sport at the age over 75 was ten times less that they did at the age of 16-24. Unsurprisingly though, people at their early twenties were the most active. One can consider different reasons for that.

Overall, the main tendency that is clearly seen from the bar chart is the decrease of the time doing exercise and sport. The older people became, the less time they spent on physical exercises and active sport.",65,1,0

However, there are people who do not support this idea. Let us consider this problem.
In my opinion, universities should not follow the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students. To begin with, in modern world in proffesional area people do not have Features of having ecpecia sex. That means that in Universities study students and people should not ceparate them according to their sexes. Moreover, it could be difficult to realise it because an inequal quantity of men and women is essential for the real life. Finally, in certain regions stereotypes made some proffesions only one sex-oriented. In this way, univeisities can not set equal numbers of male and female students because of formed lraditions there.
However, there are people who think differenlty. They argue that setting equal numbers of boys and girls in each subject is necessary. These people claim that introduction of this rule make process of studying more pleasant and sensible. They also suppose that it helps students to got used to the conditions which they get after graduation. I do not agree with them. I personally think that historically men and women have different living purposes and they do not have the same needs in graduating. So that accepting the equal numbers of male and female students is not a successful idea.
To sum up, different people may have their own unique point of view. But I think that accepting this idea will not not bring efficient benefits to society.

Some people say that if perpetrators are forsed to spend more time in prison, the crime rates will decrease, while others tend to disagree and believe that prisons do not help in reducing crime at all. Long prison sentences may not  be effective in changing the criminals way of thinking, but t least they keep the traitors away from normal people for a long time. Such practice is already applied in some countries such as the United States, where one easily spend the rest of his or her life in jail, even if this one performed just one murder or robbery. You could see such ridiculously strict penalties consequences in movies like “The Shawshank Redemption” where an inmate who was found quilty while being a youngster was set free only when he became an old man. He couldn’t integrate to the new society after release and as a result committed suicide. The bad news is that after such a long time spend in a jail one not usually start a new life from a scratch. The system leaves criminals little else to do but committing crimes again. On the other hand, methods other than jail proved better efficiency in changing perpetrators’ behavior, especially the ones who committed a crime accidentially. These methods are applied in many European countries such as Norway, where jail cells look like expensive hotel rooms, and the staff is generous and doesn’t use violence as a form of control. I also read that some non-profit organizations move some prisoners who behaved well from a usual jail to an apartment just before release. These organizations also try to find a job these ex-criminals, enhancing their integration to socium. And this form of reducing crime looks the most appealing to me. Unfortunately, these organizations do not work in Russia. Here, without a doubt, it will take a long time to reform the ways of punishment. Our officials still think that good jail is still the perfect way to fight crime. And I don’t like this tendency much.

I absolutely agree with this statement. Nowadays many people fight for equal rights for men end women. And equal numbers of male and female in universities can be a good opportunity to get education for many people from different countries.
Firstly , I support the idea that all people have equal human rights. Consequantly, all young people should have opportunity to study in university. For example, there is emansipation in modern world. People, who enter in this organisation or just support their idea , think that females have the same rights as males. For many years member of emansipation have been fighting for equal rights for male and female all over the world.
Secondly , in some countries the predictable that women should stay at home and don't need in education, exist. For instance, in African countries or in Asian countries or in India such predictable take place. And I believe that universities don't accept such policy when women are under pressure of their husbands or their countries' traditions. Women from Africa , Asia and India should have chance to get an education . So universities need to have equal vacant place for male and female. 
Thirdly , as for me , the equal percentage of students - male and female - are very helpful for science and education. Because men and women have different views to the same things . So the education is more effective when equal numbers of men and women encourage and unite for different projects or team work .
Thus, I absolutely agree with idea that in universities should teach the equal numbers of men and women in each faculty. Because of all men and women have equal rights and equal chance to get education. And, of course, universities in Africa, Asia shouldn't follow the policy when women haven't the same right like men and haven't chance to enter university. Sometimes it can be helpful for education and science both of male's and female's views.

Firstly, it is not a secret that every mean of transport may cause serious air pollution. So, it does not matter if people travel by bus, by train or by plane. Personnaly I think that cars make the biggest negative impact on the atmosphere, but surely not travelling by air.
Another argument is a level of comfort. Usually it is more conviniet for a person to sit in a soft chair with a cup of tea and a meal for some hours than spend time with many strangers in a train and get bored for much longer time.
Moreover, almost every businessman faced with a situation when they have an important event far away from the city and very little time left before it. Of course the only way to be there in time is to go by plane, because it is the fastest mean of transport.
Finally, one argument connected with money. Sometimes in the last days before the departure tikets on the train could be really expencive nd not everybody have enough money to pay for it. So, it may be even cheaper to find an appropriate race on plane.
To sum up it is important to notice that I am totally against limitations of air travellig, because it is not the most harmful mean of transport and in these way the idea of government will just reduce people's opportunity.

Mostly the rail is used to deliver metals that take 35 percents of the total amount and manufactured goods that take 25 percents of the total amount. So, these two categories occupate more than a half of the whole rail traffic. At the same time, 28 percents of road traffic is taken for the same manufactured goods. That means the both ways are quite equally comfort and popular for manufactured goods' transportation. Also, road is mainly used for food products' transportation that occupate 30 percents of the whole road traffic. Unlike manufactured goods, food products only take 11 percents of the total amount of goods transported by the rail.

To my mind, the latter argument has a stronger possible argumentation. 


To begin with, let's consider the situation when person has gone in for sports or is affected by the new health care policy at the present. No matter how good the person is informed about the benefits of a healthy life-style and about the drawbacks of the opposite one still the most important and the only relevant factor is the self-consciesnons of the person about whether it is good or bad to smoke, in particular, in public places. So, this is why the increasing of sports facilities' number itself can be observed only as the part of a very complicated policy.


In my opinion, the main part of the issue's solving lies in the fact that all our beliefs and inner rules have been formed in the childhood. Consequently, there are two main prospests of how shildren's minds should be affected in the terms of health-care policy. Firstly it is about a strict control of mass-media censure, including radio, TV, and internet. Secondly, the way upbringing was going on anay determiners the rest of the person's life. So, it is the matter of parent's skills to rise the proper beliefs in their child's minds.


In conclusion, the improvement of public health should implies a complicated solving policy, while the increasing of sports facilities is just the partial one.

Some people think that it is unfair to copy and share files, others approve it, because they do not want to pay extra money. I agree with the first opinion: this act is not under the low, so people should be punished.
First of all, free copying, sharing, and downloading decrease profits of many musical and film-making firms, so it can be called the theft. A great variety of producers annually spends huge sums of money to make a good film or to write and record high-qualitive music album. Due to the pirate copies all these spendings may be not covered, which means reduction in salaries of ordinary people, who work in this company. Moreover, even further producing of media content can be stopped.
The second reason for my opinion is that a great range of companies spends a significant part of their profit on some social need, which is presented by different fonds. These fonds help old people, families with many children, children, who grow up without parents and many others. It means that free copying and downloading makes social welfare go down. At the same time, government now needs more money to maintain the same level of social protection, so taxes is likely to increase. The final result for the person, who took free copy, is the same because he or she pays extra money in every case. In addition, if such people are punished, at the end they will worse off.
To sum up, pirate copying is a serious problem not only for discret companies, but also for the whole population, so, in my opinion, it should be solved by introducing a special penalty for people who break the rules.

A lot of people think that is burning issue. And politics try to solve this problem. I’ll try to tell you my opinion as full as possible.

On the one hand produce the food for own population and reduce level of import is really good idea. Because for every country is very impossible to be independent. And just think about own agricultural power. For example in USSR produced the quantity of food which this country gave population and export for the other countries.

For the other hand not of the all countries has an opportunity to produce own food, because of clomat and geopolitics. In this situation helps modernization. And this country produce things, which this country can sell for the others countries. For example Europe and Unity of Euro countries. Each country produce the own product and sell it for the other countries like a Germany, France, Spain, Finland and etc. 

In conclusion I think that doesn’t matter how government make level of the life, just matter which is this level. North Koreas is independent n the all sides, but the level of life is a low, but in Europe each country has own deal, produce own product – is not independent inside of trading with other countries. It is called madernization  - it is nessesary thing in our life.

So people forget about care about their health. They go to the work and don`t eat in right way, as a consequences they have some problems with health. Some people believe that if we increase the number of sport facilities, we will improve public health.
I rather agree than disagree with this point of view. Because, sport helps to keep fit and also develop fusical abilities. For example, while you running we breath oxigen that helps your body don`t have serious problem with heart. Besides, nowadays it is common to use bycicles. It is a kind of sport, which helps your feet. It is also traffic solution. Because people use car less and we breath a fresh air. Furthermore, almost in every hostel there is sport club, where you can meet with new people. As a result you will have a good mood and do not have serious problems with your mind.
As I concerned, sport improve our health, however, we don`t have to remember about some negative effects. Firstly there are people who nave serious problem with health, e.g. vision lossing or breaking feet. These people can not doing some kind of sports. So, they have to eat some fruits and some medicaments to improve their health, I suppose that fresh food is also an exellent method to get a good health. Secondly, some people work too hard in sport clubs. As a result they can have a serious problems with body. So, I think I prove that sport have not little effect on public health, there are negative or only positive effect. In conclussion I`d like to say that, sure sport is important part in our life, but it is decide to everyone use or not sport in real life. But we should not forget about other method, which can care about our health.

Producing compact discs and digital video disks brings criminal dealer a lot of money.

Small wonder that a main issue of consumers the debate, is the offensive price set on compact discs. Instead of spending nearly twenty dollars per compact disc, consumers are finding it much ,ore reasonable to illegally download the songs they want. The risk is very minimal.

To my mind, selling pirate music and films is a kind of theft because people who sell them exercise one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without autorization. Legal producers of music and film suffer considerable losses. Buying pirate production consumers support the seller’s unauthotization actions. What is more, the quality of these disks usually leaves much to be desired. So if you don’t want to waste your money and to lose your good spirits, you’d better not buy bad production. On the other hand, disks of good quality are usually rather expensive and not everybody can afford to buy them. Besides, pirates sell the latest records and so we are able to watch new films or listen to new songs. That is why a lot of people continue buying pirate music and film.

To conclude, I think it is better to go to the movies or to buy qualitative music and film if you want to enjoy good films or music. To add to it, bad music and film will disappear and it will improve the country’s economy.

It is in general argued such situation today when some companies open their businesses in developing countries, where they encourage local employees to work in abroad companies. This kind of development can be watched from two points of view, because it has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there are good reasons why international companies should provide such changes. The chief reason for this improvement is that such policy helps to develop international businesses,  global access and global communication. Furthermore, it is good opportunity for international companies to move their businesses to poorer countries, because local workers’ salaries is much lower than in developed countries. Is standards of living  are not high , the companies will get more profit, because people can work, getting a little wage. Moreover, not only international companies get profit, but also poorer countries have benefits, because its living conditionals also become better. On the other hand, there are some reasons against such development. First of all, if companies want to develop their businesses in poorer countries, they will lose the interest to do this in their native country. Thus, it means that the capital of their countries start decreasing. Such policy cannot be allowed by governments, so they can try to prevent it. Not with standing, development of businesses n poorer countries can sound great, it can have different difficulties for companies, because the governments do not want the money to go away from the country. In conclusion, it seems important to point out that, although, such advantages as cheap lobour force and more profit, international companies should not forget about some difficulties, which can be connected with problem between them and government, which do not simplified their businesses, but conversely, can damage it.

One of the solutions suggested is to keep criminals in prisons for longer periods than now. In my opinion, however, this would not help much and some other measures should be taken.  On the one hand, the idea of giving longer prison sentences seems to be reasonable. First of all, people would be more frightened of punishment, since they would know that they might spend nearly the whole life in prison for the crime. Further, some of the criminals do not change in prison and might bring new troubles to the society after the end of the period spent in prison. It could be also suggested, that if such opportunities would be provided they might study and work in prison and gradually change their views.  On the other hand, this solution is arguable and to me personally does not seem to be very convincing. It should be stressed, that this idea is not humanistic, as long prison sentences do not give the criminals tha chance to start new life after the end of the sentence. Next, as the reserchers show, in some countries where the sentences were rather long the crime rate did not change significantly. Finally, from my point of view, such measures would make people in general much more depressed, as Christianity, for example, learns us to forgive, and many people are religious nowadays.  To sum up, after discussing both these views, it could be said that such measures seem to be too radical and may shock the society. In my opinion, what should be done instead, are the attempts to raise the level of education, of life in general, to make it more comfortable to live in big cities and to encourage people to communicate more not only with their relatives or friends, but also with other citizens. I would also like to suggest to raise the public awareness of the problem of the high crime level, as alternative ways to improve the situation may be found.",70,2,2

It is known that they extremely increase by the affection of air travel. However, in my opinion, people cannot refuse from air travelling even partially because it has already became the important part of their lives.
Firstly, it is obvious that travelling by plane is much more convenient than, for example, by car or by train. It takes less time, what really makes sense in case someone suddenly decides to get somwhere quickly. Once I was in a very unpleasant situation - I knew that I should be at the conference in Crimea the next day, and the only way to do it was to take a plain. Moreover, air travel is comfortable, whereas in trains it is terribly hot in summer. It is very difficult to spend time there, especially if your trip is long.
Secondly, cars are more dangerous than plains. The statistic shows that the risk of car accident is very big. Although the accident happened during air are always shown on TV and seemed to be frequent, it is not true.
Thirdly, there are lots of places where people can go only in the air. For instance, Kamchatka is surrounded by mountains and there is no opportunity to get through them by car.

It is clear from the first diagram that people of the age 26 tend to study mainly for career prospects whereas people who are over 49 choose studying because of interest. According to the diagram, the rate of people choosing study for career decreases with the aging. At the same time, the percentage of people studying because interest grows up attaining approximately 70% at its peak.  The amount of people from age grows of 40 - 49 is equal both for cases of career estoblishment and simple interest.
The second graph indicates that employers are more likely to help workers at the age under 26. The group of people of 30 – 39 gets the least support which is about 35%. 
Overall, the fact that people of the age under 26 are getting more help from their companies may be connected to the fact that their main reason of studying is future career development. The people of 30 -39 are supposed to have already settled and organized their career and family life that’s why they don’t require additional help from their company.

Governments have an opportunity to take care about this important question by regulating a number of different air transport. The degree of this control is a vital issue to be discussed. Initially, the trend of global warming, air pollution and other threatening changes in our environment are undoubtedly seen nowadays. That is why the modern society is faced with this problem and has to solve it as quickly as it possible. However, to my point of view, air travel causes not so many wastes and rubbish to influence the environment a lot. In comparison with other human wastes such as pollution caused by cars and factories, planes are not so bad. I also feel very strongly that any type of government regulating is a reason for decreasing of number of alternatives for people’s choice. Introducing new laws is not only expensive for the society, but also killing for a desire of any human to make a choice and control his life. Eventually, I have to line up my answer. Air travelling is bad for our environment and this problem have to be solved, but we have to think about the costs of our regulation in this sphere. Much more effective way to reduce air rubbish and bad influence on the environment is to research this topic scientificly and make vital inventions. Introducing laws is only a short-term solution of a problem, which is also killing and difficult to be represented in life, as many people have to fly, have to change their location fast and cannot leave this opportunity.

It’s not a big surprise that some people are richer that others, and, as a result, in every country there are citizens who experience the consequences of economic diversity every day. A “Guaranteed Basic Income” system which provides a stable sum of money every month can become a solution to this problem. But is the best option for country’s economy? Let us find it out.
To begin with, a “Guaranteed Basic Income” can become a breath of fresh air for poor people who don’t have enough money to buy even basic products for their survival. For example, it may help single poor mothers who don’t get any economic support from their ex-husbands to bring up their children, pay for food and education and provide them with everything they need. What is more, this guaranteed sum of money may greatly support people who experience slight, not constant problems with their income. For example, it will be useful for people who suddenly lost their job and need some time and money before they find a new place to work in.
On the other hand, this system has some significant disadvantages which may lead to huge economic problems. Firstly, some citizens will definitely use this guaranteed sum of money as their basic income. As a result, there will be less people who want to find a job and country’s economy will definitely suffer from that decrease in the number of employers. Secondly, this system may even lead to increase in the level of poorness as people won’t have motivation to work. For example, there are some citizens who don’t want to work anywhere because they already receive income from governments and don’t have a desire to get extra money.
All in all, I believe that governments and political parties should pay attention to both advantages and disadvantages of this system before using it in the economy of any country in the world. In my opinion, this system may help poor people, but at the same time destroy economic prosperity.",70,2,1

Many international companies are trying to find solvations of their financial problems. One of the interesting ideas companies came up with is to change locations of their buisnesses from their own countries to poorer, developing ones. Is it really a very good buisness idea or just a waste of money and time?On the one hand, this idea has many advantages. First one is low-costed employ of local workers. For example, ""Apple"" company build their own main factories in China there they spend less money on creating of Iphones, Ipads  and etc. If you have Iphone or Ipad, just check there it was produced. Secondly, taxes in poor and developing countries are very low. That helps companies to have financial benefits out of this. For example, ""Volvo"" builds their cars in Novosibirsk, Russia. That helps them avoid taxes of Russian Federation then they import their product. They only pay taxes for car production which are very low in Russia. On the other hand, the process of changing location to poorer and developing countries is very expensive. For example, ""Apple"" company spent billions of dollars on building their factories in China. Yes, they found their own benefits there by low-costed workers, but before that they spent huge amount of money on re-organization of their company in different country. Secondly, there is a very demanding law process. Before you can open your company in the other country you have to get many documents. Many companies cannot afford themselves buying, for example, license for producing and selling their product.  In my opinion, idea to move buisnesses to slow developing countries is very good, but not every company can afford it. The process of changing the location is very demanding financially and emotionally. For example, ""Apple"" company or ""Volvo"" company can afford themselves to do their buisnesses in other countries. But, for example, our Russian company called ""Lada-cars"" which is actually a very big company, unfortunately, cannot afford to do buisness in other countries. Only to export their product. ",65,2,2

This issue elicits a lot of controvercy because some people argue for exclusion of caught athletes for a limited period whereas other people are certain that these sportsmen should be excluded for the rest of their life. In this essay both views will be discussed and I am going to express my own opinion.
Regarding to the first point of view it can be said that, firstly, using of illegal drugs can be connected with the sufering with some health problems. Drugs can be increase the health level, so the athlet can tackle with the disease quicklier than without these medecins. Despite this moment being complicated for making correct decision, I suppose that such sportsman can be excluded only for a limited period so he or she can restore their physical fit. However, the situations when the usage of illegal drugs was connected with the cheating, should not be forgotten or underestimated as in this case it is irrespectable to other athletes who train and do not break the rules of the competitions.
Nevertheless, there is another point of view. Some people argue that athletes who use the drugs, illegally and break the laws must be excluded from the professional sport forever. Although these actions can be claimed to be dishonest, it is still very complicated to make a correct decision because it is very important to understand the causes of reasons why this athlete made a decision to use the illegal drugs. If it was the use without knowing that these medecins are banned, the punishment should not be similar to those decisions made by the sportsman with fully comprehension of the situation. 
Last point that I would like to mention is my own opinion. I think that both points of view expressed in this essay can exist because the border between these two decisions is too subtle. What is more, nowadays sport is closely connected with the politics, with the prestige and the name of the country. Sportsmen try to do everything to become a champion because it is the aim from the government. However, the exclusion forever from the sport can be unfare as sport is the life of the sportsmen.
To conclude, I would like to say that both opinions can be correct but it is very important to understand the reasons and the purposes of the illegal drugs' use. Moreover, sport should be devided from the politics. In my opinion in this case it will become much better and much more clean in all aspects.

Free films and music are only two of them. At the era of the fast Internet we can share different files almost without any limits. Due to this, the problem of illegal copying is arising today.
Some people think that spreading music albums and films on the Internet must be recognised as a crime, and people who has committed that should be gone on trial. As for me, I totally agree with their position.
Firstly, any film, song or any other piece of art is author’s property. This means that, for example, only director can decide to whom he would sell or demonstrate his film. Copying this property is unacceptable. In modern democratic countries the power of law should protect the right of self-property and punish those who violate the law. Moreover, it can be recognised as stealing money and labour from artists which is also illegal.
Secondly, copying and sharing music and films fo free can have a bad influence on the economy growth. Intertaining business, which includes films and music, is usually a huge part of country’s income (for example, the USA). So, if you steel films and songs, it is equal if you steel products and create a kind of “black” or “shade” market on the Internet. The economy suffers a lot due to illegal transactions because it looses masses of money and product turnover.
All in all, any type of steeling should be forbidden in modern countries. Copying and sharing music and films on the Internet is definitely a theft and have to be punished. Today Nobody doubts that money stealing is a crime and that you are not allowed to take someone’s property without paying for it. So why should we let internet thefs commit their crimes and more? I strongly believe that there is no reasons for that.

According to the chart, there is a significant gender difference in every area except bachelor's degree. For example, only about 10% of women decided to take skilled vocational diploma, while more than 80% of men did so. Another areas with the higher percentage of males are postgraduate diploma and master's degree, 70% and 60% respectively. Nevertheless, women were more appealed to have undergraduate diploma, as the number of them made up 70%. In comparison, the amount of men was only half of that.


To summarize, it is obvious that men were more involved in higher education than women. Although there were some types of degrees that interested females more, the overall trend is reverse. We can see clearly that the amount of males in almost any other area was double as the females' one.

However, there are opponents of this point of view who believe that people that share music and films should be prisoned. I support the latter opinion.
First of all, there is a data that shows that producers, who make our favourite music and films, borrow huge costs from production of these pieces of art. To make them continue writing songs and recording films, consumers should give their money and more the distribution process absolutely clear. Some bid companies like Apple or Google have already invented a service which makes the process easier – people pay a monthly fee and listen to as much music and watch as many films as they want.
Secondly, the developed countries have implemented a lot of copyrights laws that save musicians and film producers from losing money and punish those people who break the laws. For example, the founder of Piratebay, a website with tons of illegal music, films and books, was sentenced to 21 years in American prison! These lawsuits, for sure, will prevent people from sharing the pieces of art illegally. 
In conclusion, it must be noted that illegal copying and sharing music or films is one of the main problems in the modern digital world and no doubt it should be discussed by politicians on the highest level. As discs with music and films die in the past and media go the Internet, the government should issue strong restrictions on distribution of illegal digital content.

The most dramatic was the change for technology – we can see that jobs in this sphere are much more popular now. In the age group 18-25 35 times more people work in technology now. For technology two groups of middle-aged people are approximately 7 and 13 times respectively bigger now compared to the data of 1998.

It is hardly surprising, that authorities try to do their best in solving these problems. It strikes me, that if the pollution can be reduced, people should use all opportunities to do it. Due to the fact that some air travel can be replaced by other transport, they should be banned. Nowadays modern cities are powerhouses of different meanes of transport, that is why there are a lot of opportunities to refuse from air travelling. For example, there is special train between Saint-Petersburg and Moscow that can cope with this way for 4 hours. Obviously, it will be faster to do it by a plane, but this train is an ecological-friendly one. Moreover, it is known that going somewhere by plane is really dangerous way of travelling. Recent air disasters prove that. Becides the use of this transport is very expensive. In comparison with trains, only rich people can afford it. At the same time, taking lot of time, travelling by a train is a great possibility to relax and to enjoy stanning views instead of the same picture while going by a plane. To sum up, if people can save this planet without big loss, they should do it, because the upshort of this comfortable and quick trips can be very sad for the environment. Of cause, there are some situations when planes can not be prohibited, when it is a question of human lives. Despite this fact, there are a lot of other cases, when air tripes can and should be baned, for instance, for leisure. If people refuse from them, whey will loose something, but they will solve environmental problem.

The impulses which induce gadjets, ruin our nervous system and deteriorate heart breaks. Furthermore, technologies weaken our organism and as a result the huge amount of harmful substances reach our organism and deliver a lot of illnesses and microbes.
These wide range of problems can be decreased by human efforts. Firstly, people should decraase time, which they spend with gadjets. It reduce harmful effect on our organism. Secondly, scientists should improve technologies using different details for it. They can make the screen less devastating on vision. Finally, people can decrease distance between them and computers.

In my opinion, the main cause of this problem is the lack of parents' and teachers’ control and the lack of engagement of young people. Nowadays parents often work most of the time, having almost no time to their children left. Therefore, children have a lack of engagement. They do not have enough attention from their parents, so they need to engage themselves on their own.
At the same time, educational system in most of the countries is built the way that the majority of kids and teenagers are bored, so they hate school and, therefore, are not engaged with education.
As a result, young people are left uncontrolled and unengaged. At that very moment, the role of other kids and teenagers around them is extremely important. And often badly raised kids have more authority in such cases. That is why a lot of young people are influenced by those trouble kids, so they also start behaiving badly and become juveniles.
From this perspective, parents and teachers can change the situation. First of all, parents should spend more time with their kids and engage them more. Secondly, teachers should do their best to make young people being interested in their subjects. In addition to that, a special approach towards troubled kids is required. If parents are not able to engage their children themselves, they should at least try to pick a good surrounding for them. If a child is surrounded by motivated pupils, he or she will also try to be better and study harder under their influence.

In this essay. I am going to analyze advantages and disadvantages of this hotly debated issue. On the one hand, there are many benefits of building businesses in poorer, developing countries. First of all, when international companies hired locals they not only give many workplaces for people but also help those countries to inrich their economy. Another positive aspect of such cases is that usually when companies build their factories they improve roads and lands, which are located not far from the territory of their factories. Speaking about th other side of the coin, developing businesses in poorer countries definitely has some negative aspects. One of the main disadvantages is that with increase of factories the nature of such countries as India and China is getting poorer and wicker. For instance, there are thousands of kilometers of forests are disappear every year by giving space for new factories. In conclusion, personally I believe  that there are more good aspects of moving companies’ businesses to developing countries such as India and China, but never should we forget about eco resources that could take years to be renewed. In general, it could be said that benefits outweighed negative aspects and harmful effects.

What it means for them to be happy? We cannot easely answer this question; while this defenition means different for particular persons, but still there are some factors that can help to achieve  this feeling.
First of all, happiness for rich and poor people means different things. To define rich and poor, for instance, we can look at some African citizens, who are starving. For them a small rain, during hot and killing days may be the greatest pleasure, and people, who are leaving in big cities always judging such days. People who have nothing know how to be happy ones by finding a small, unexpected present on the street. For others it is much harder to be happy. When you have all, nothing can suprise you. To reach happiness people need to stop being always angry and tired, they need to find the way to feel, better about everyting that happening around them.
Nevertheless, happiness is not only things around it is also people that are close to you: family and friends. It is well known that children, that grow up in half families sometimes have lack of happiness than people from normal ones. Also, became unhappy when they are treated bad at schools, universities and even at work. But in spite of the relationships in groups it is more sagniffecient when the things that you do makes you happy. When a person is complitely in work, in most cases he achiev happiness.
In conclusion, it is hard to define happiness, and for different people different factors lead to that feeling. In my opinion, the real happiness can come not only after a hard work, even if sometimes it is an important factor, but also it may appear from any corner of the life.

To begin with, almost all people can visit airport or its site to see the influence of airplanes on our environment. This problem is critical to our society and some measures and improvments have been done, but some advantages are not used widely by all firms in this economic sphere. Consequently, authorities should first of all reduce the harm of air transport using current results of the development of knowledge and science and not shorten the volume of the air industry. At the same time air transport is very young comparising with rail, car or water methods of travelling. So that when government will try to cure the environment by restricting the industry it should start with leisure part. In this way, the society will not lose positive effects of the development of business which in future also can be changed toward right working system.

It is a well known fact that in todays world people use gadgets a lot. Computers and cell phones became necessary things for almost all of us, so that we use them more often than any other things and this is very harmful for our eyes. Sitting in front of the computer during work day and then spending time looking at phone screens makes our eyes very stressed. Moreover, it causes pain in back. Moreover, today most people use cars and walk on foot very little, which also leads to physical weakness and sometimes even to obesity.

However, there always some ways to reduce the harmful impact of technologies. For instance, it is obvious that ones who spend a lot of time working on computer should remember to make a rest regularly, as even 5-10 minutes of eye-exercises helps to avoid eye stress, which can result in short-sight. Furthemore, it is always better to go on foot. Spending spare time by walking in the park is also much more healthier than chatting in socias nets. In addition, we need to do some sport in order to keep in shape and avoid such problem as obesity. Besides, only physical activity helps to have a better mood and feel full of evergy.

Taking everything into account, I would like to point out that even though the unreasonable and not wize use of modern technologies can cause health problems, to avoid them and stay healthy

For my opinion, to have business out the country have a lot of advantages. Firstly, in poor countries the workers are vey cheap. The people in poor countries can do the same work as people in developed country, but with the less payment. So, you can have the maximum profit. Secondly, if you started business in the poor countries you can help people to live in the international world. You can give them a possibility to work. There is other side of the problem. If you started business in the other country your native country have no any profit. The national economy can decline. People in developed countries will not have a work. Such situation we could see in 2005 when developed countries like USA, Germany preferred to build their factories in the China. Chinese people had a job, and Chineese economy rised, but Germans and Americans no. To conclude, it wanna say that business in the developing countries is a good way for all world. It improves not only international community, but also helps people from developing countries to live in better condition.

It is interesting and, of course, important to understund what has lead the young generation to the situation they are in now. What are the main causes of the increased number of crimes? And what are we to do to decrease the number of crimes committed by the young?
In my opinion, there is a number of reasons for new generation to be more into illegal behaviour. First of all, they are much more childish and infantile, than previous generations. From my experience I can say that a lot of people of my age are irresponsible and still can't live on their own. Surprisingly, their parents do nothing in order to change it and don't try to help their children to become truly adult. Therefore, since the young don't feel themselves responsible for their doings they commit more crimes and don’t think about the future. It is also important to say that modern culture literally propogate violence and crimes. Such propaganda works better on the young people and makes them think of criminal actions as of something worth doing.
Now we need to enderstand what to do to diminish the crime among the younger generation. I think that the main way to do this is to teach youngsters to be more responsible. Parents and teachers need to educate them on what is the punishment for the illegal behaviour and make them understand that their life is only in their hands and in nobody's else. As for Russia, I think that young people in my country should start working more early and move out from parents as soon as possible. It worked well for me and I am sure it will work well for others. 
However, I also think that the main problem is not the lack of responsible or violence on TV and Internet, it may be just different view on the world. Every generation is unique and it may be that the laws of the old generation just don't suit the philosophy of the new one.
To conclude, I want to say that increased crime rute among youngsters is, indeed, a serious problem. They are our future and if we don’t want to live in chaos and anarchy we have to understand how to make the young to obey the law and be useful members of society.

This measures allow poor families to visit sport centres, show people that sport is available for them, attract children`s attention to the health way of life.
From the other hand, even thought there are will be more sports facilities, it is necessary to explain people why sport is important, also to represent them the utility of it.

However, it is suggested to be inequitable from people not to pay money for what they download from the Internet. Such people are supposed to be punished. I agree with this to some extent, but I think that it is more fair to punish those, who create pirate copies.
On the one hand, people should not create illegal pirate copies and spread it through the Internet due to several reasons. To begin with, if people have free access to music or films, musicians and film producers do not get enough money for their work. In such case original discs remain unsold. Moreover, from point of law using illegal pirate copies is evaluated as theft. People who do not follow laws should be punished accordingly. If nobody is responsible for theft of music and films other people will not have incentives to buy the original discs and start to use pirate copies.
On the other hand, copying and sharing music or films is not theft in its usual sense. It should not be equal to other thefts. Furthermore, it is necessary to punish not those, who download illegal copies, but those who create them. People who create illegal pirate copies are responsible for this and should be punished. Finally, ones who download illegal files may not completely understand what he or she does.
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is necessary to punish people who create illegal pirate copies and not allow people to download such files.

Although the government is trying to fight this in collaboration with parents, the number of legal violations has become alarming in the recent years. In this essay, I will outline the causes of this tendency and provide some possible solutions.
First of all, teenagers require a lot of care and attention. When they are being ignored by their family and friends, youngsters resort to crime in order to be noticed. A possible way to change this situation is introducing certain team-building activities for families to return trust among their members. For example, it is possible to start an organization that sets up retreats where families do activities that reqire support and understanding or have honest discussions where everyone listens to each other's viewpoint.
Secondly, a lot of adolescents are urged to make life-changing decions at a very young age, like choosing their future profession. This puts them under an incredible amount of stress, so they rebel against the norms of society and choose an alternative, albeit illegal, way of providing for themselves. In this situation parents and teachers should provide psychological help and assist teenagers in choosing their path. Lectures and talks with successful people from various professional fields, organized by the school staff, as well as parents encouraging children to explore their talents will make youngsters more ambitious and career-minded.
Taking everything into consideration, although teenagers sometimes stray from the appropriate lifestyle, which is accepted by the society, it is the responsibility of elder mentors to help the young to understand who they are and choose their future accordingly.",75,2,1

There are several reasons for this development, in my opinion. The most powerful of them is the evolution of video games throughout the last decades. Whereas they were originally created to educate and entertain (it is widely known that video games boost motor skills, for instance), nowadays video game developers are instead using whatever will keep kids playing, in their technological products. In the first order, violence. A lot of video games challenges nowadays require to kill, thieve, rob and so forth. As kids become used to the violence  on a computer screen, they easily bring it into the real life as well.
The other cause of this effect concerns violence on the TV screen. However, I consider it to be less powerful than the computer games case, as, in contrast with the TV, kids commit vigilant crimes in the video game themselves. Nevertheless, the TV plays a huge role in making kids used to the violence, that is why they do not see it as a bad feature.
The most important thing parents and teachers should do, in my view, is to encourage people (especially kids) to play good games and watch worthy films. In the modern society, parents rarely supervise what their kids do and do not watch, and what entertains them.
By creating a kind and friendly environment by teaching kids to search for good games and TV shows, parents and teachers may encourage young people to reject playing violent games and watching films involving vigilant activities, in favor of games and films that develop a good sense of humour and appeal our sensibility.
To sum up, I would say that as long as the violence remains the same on a computer and TV screen, it would remain the same in life. As soon as we discourage it there, the real-life crime rate among young people will start dropping.

First of all, not everyone knows how difficult to create some music or movies. This is realy hard work, that need lots of time, money and health to make really good stuff. 

Second we are all know that life is better when you can have something for free, because not everyone can afford to buy CD’s or DVD for high price because video and music shops make % for each CD or DVD, so it’s better to find things in the Internet just put the ‘free’ word searching. 

However, I think that not all of films and music cos their money, because now people that make movies or music think that they can do some junk-movie or junk-music, just to make a lot of money, and it’s not quite good, because they are not artists; they just want your money, not respect.

The question is, do the governments need to make people travel less for some purposes? In my opinion, it is not necessary to cut down on the amount of air travel for world and enjoyment. Here are some arguments which support my point of view. First of all, depriving people of the chance to travel for business purposes may have a serious negative impact on global economy. For instance, large companies will not be able to employ foreign specialists for temporary tasks as well as to send their specialists study abroad. Consequently, it is likely to lead to the decrease of the quality of work those companies provide. Furthermore, nowadays we live in a fast-moving world, where the vast majority of people spend most of their time at work, which means they need a plenty of time to relax. In modern society, travelling is considered to be the best way to get rid of stress. From my point of view, reducing the amount of travel will definitely cause great stress in society. On the other hand, there are those who claim that it is vitally important to preserve environment, so we need to reduce air pollution, particulary by travelling less by planes. Those people say that there are many other ways of travelling, such as by train or by ships, which people can experience. However, I don’t agree with such opinion, since I believe that these days there is a great number of other sources of pollution, not only fumes from planes. It occurs to me that we need to get rid of other sources of pollution, since the reduction of air travel might influence badly other aspects of our society. In conclusion, although some people state that air travel should be limited, I strongly believe that it will not solve environmental problems. I really think introducing such restrictions may influence global economy and social harmony in a destructive way.

Everybody who make a deal with such material are guilty and should pay. This essay proofs that it is true but not in all aspects.
As for me, I partly agree with this opinion for some reasons. One the one hand, it is a sourse of unrespectable behaviour to the producers of the films and compositions because they had to work hard, spend lot’s of money to create their ideas and, what is more, their creations contain the souls of their makers. It is so unpleasant for creators to work for nothing, without any payback. I want to illustrate it with my own experience. I do my best in university and it is hurting feeling when I kenen that my works helps not truthful students to pass the exam, for example. They steal my creations. My work is my creation, I’m sure.
On the other hand, it is wonderful when you have no time to go to the cinema or musical concert because you study or work all day long and you can search the Internet and find new film for good cinema evening. No doubt, many students or children want to watch everything but they have not enough money for it. In this case illegal pirate copies is a way out. From my point of view, when my friends don’t want to go to the cinema with me it is more pleasunt to stay at home and exite the composition in warm armchair.
To sum up, the overall analysis can says that people should pay for every good or facility, but we live in the era of technologies and it is an essential part of it, especially if it is impossible to find the guilty one.

Actually, twenty first centuary changed  world around: you now don’t need to steal original discs because everyone can get access to them on internet for free. So is it the rule of new reality we all should accept or pirates should be punished for copying films and music?
On the one hand, we all understand that in modern world making music and films often is all about money. Authors spend a lot of recources for studios, actors, marketing and so on, and they have a right to get their investment back with some kind of payment from society. And in this model, internet is a factor which blocks a huge amount of sales because some part of films and music auditory prefers to get this content for free and forgets about payment to creators. While this happens, authors get less money than they could, so there is less motivation for them to create new interesting content. In this way of thinking it looks like we should say “yes, we need to punish pirates”.
But from the other side, we should understand that the process of customer’s decision making is pretty difficult. People don’t want to spend money for thing they are low informed about, but when we, for example, get possibility to listen some musician for free, it’s easier for us to make decision about buyin tickets at his concert. So, free content may be a part of business.
As for me, we can do nothing with fact that internet changes markets, so content creators should learn how to change their models of monetisation and make them more suitable to the modern world. So if people don’t want to pay for music, we should check, for example, if they are ready to pay for ways to listen it with comfort (like Apple music for iPhone). Creators need to do their suggestion to customers more complexe. Or die.

This graph shows in the USA and in Sweden proportion of senior population increased until 1980. In the USA there was slight drop from 15% to 13% and then growth in 2020. In Sweden there was also slight drop from 1980but only to 1990 and then rise to 20% of people ages 65 and over until 2010. There was a decline from 2010 to 2020 and then it increases again. In Japan from 1940 to 1960 there was decrease and then proportion remained the same till the middle of 1980’s. Then number of people over 65 started to grow and from 2030 there is a dramatically rise to 25%.
Although, situations in different countries are not the same, it can be noted that number of 65 aged and over people tends to grow.

That’s why musicians and producers lose huge amounts of money per year.

On the one hand, there is huge quantity of people who can’t buy films or music, such as students, elderly man and women, poor males and females, children. But they want to get an education, for example in films school, or just see education movie. These groups of people just have no ability to pay for these things. For instance, Andry Tarkovskiy grow up in poor family, but he had no enough money to watch movies, that’s why he tries to do it without payment. The other example is our grandparents from the Sovet Union. They copied films and saw abroad films, because they were very interested in other culture. 

On other hand, producers, musicians, costume designers made the great work. They spent their time on making film or song, so they can be payed. When you have done the work it is normally to get money for it. But in this occasion a lot of people does not do it, so the expences cannon be covered. For example, if someone steal products from the shop, this person must be punished because it is breaking the law. For instance,  when the Samsung steak the design of new Iphone and produced nearly the same phines, the Iphone company submit in court and the Samsung payed a huge amount of money.

To sum up, in my opinion, person who copying or sharing music or films should be punished, but not arrested. I guess it is normal to consist them to pay fee.

It is common knowledge that the increased amount of flights has led to acute environmental problems such as air pollution and global warming. The governments are aleted with this and try to impose new taxes and change the policies in order to prevent total disaster. But the proposal of reducing the number of flights is questionable. This essay will examine both positive and negative sides of the issue. to begin with, the opinion that a lot of air travels in unnecessary has many arguments. Due to the developed internet and other technological achievements business can be run from any part of world. For instance, it is common way of doing projects nowadays – bringing the members of one project from the different countries in order to keep work running 24 hours a day. When some members go to sleep, others just begin their day. What is more, the laws of reducing the amount of air travel may encourage businessmen to develop economy of their own region. That can make a huge impact on national growth in the long period. As for travelers, the policy of restricting air flights may inspire people to travel across their native country and become more culturally awared. That are foreign countries, not the own ones that young people want to travel to and that should be changed. However, there are negative consequences of reducing air travel policy. Firstly, travelling broadens the mind and gives a different perspective to people. Not only cultural knowledge is known to be expanded after seeing the life in foreign countries, but also new efficient ways of running a business or even new economic spheres are discovered. Limiting air travelling may lead to decrease in economic activities and innovations due to the fact that air flights are the most popular and the fastest means of transport system. To conclude, air travel plays a great role in modern society both for business and leisure spheres. Although there is proof that the issue of global warming is caused by air travel, there are unfavourable consequences of limiting it. The negative changes can be both in economic and cultural part of people’s lives.

First of all lets look at what specificllly health issues we talking about. One of the problems is the rays that are produced by your devices. Sometimes it causing you headache, stress and a lot of attention sometimes focused not on work but on spending time with your device. Also if you spend too much time sitting by the TV or playing games, or working on computer can cause you decreasing your eyes health and even damage them so much that you can lose your focus. For example because for my studying sphere, which is design, I have to work on my computer a lot, and because of that I can barely see what is faraway and when I was younger my eyes could see everything perfectly. So  because of my time spent on the computer today I frequently have a headache, my vision is blurred, I’m always on nerves, can’t barely calm down, sometimes I loosing the words, that I tried to say because I easily loosing my concentrate.

Second lets reconsider the ways of how to reduce the damage. You can’t ignore the damage that caused by modern devices, so we should find a way of first: how to reduce damage; second: how to get tid of damaging health.  So the answer to the questions is simple. The thing that we can’t live without is the thing that we need right now – oxygen. We should spend more time on the fresh air, so it will decrease pit headaches and provide us with calmnesy. And also no matter how cliché it sounds you should meditate for an hour a day, so your eyes can relax and your mind and all your body.

To sum up we can say that problem with health is touched by everyone. Because even our grand mothers even if not using phone, using TV’s and preferred to spent their time indoors, than outdoors, and that’s the problem people should spend more time outside, breathe the fresh air and relax by meditating and also do some yoga to correct your posture if sitting too much with your laptop.

In this essay, I will state the major problems and give solutions.
One of the firstproblems of this development is the upbringing. Parents often do not pay enough attention to their children. They might be busy with work or with some other things. So, parents do not educate their children and do not tell them how they need to behave. Consequently, these children, start lying, stealing and even killing people. Thus, parents should teach their children to distinguish what is good and what is bad. For instance, they could buy them instructive books, and give them real examples of good behaviour. This would help to prevent youngsters comitting crimes.
Another major problem is the influence of media and social networks. Lots of teenagers spend a lot of time using social networks. They might watch there some short videos, or agressive movies. Which show that there is nothing bad to gang up on someone. Moreover, they show that to become successful and rich it is necessary to bluff. For example, there is a famous film which is called wolfs from Wall- Street where the major character is a swindler who woul anything to achieve his goals. In my opinion, such films should be restricted by government for people under the age of 21. Moreover, to solve this problem teachers at schools should show students films about friendship, love and honesty. Because that what makes a person successful.
In conclusion, I would like to add, that a person who wants to commit a crime would do that, no matter what. Nevertheless, each of us can prevent from that happening. It is important to show good deeds to children from their childhood.So that they grow up as decent people.",65,2,0

Therefore, the question of what may have caused this phenomenon and what are possible consequences of it is hottly debated. First of all, today humanity lives in the age of smartphones and the Internet. Children are getting used to such devices since being infants and spend all day long surfing the Net and that is how addiction occurs. So both parents and their offspring abuse gadgets this results in the situation when they just can’t find time to spend with each other. Secondly, modern competitive employment market both parents to work in different occupations in order to be confident in terms of finances and to make ends melt while their children are getting a degree. This reason also prevent them from seeing children frequently. Finally, more and more children nowadays prefer friends to family due to the fact that puss understand them better, which is also harmful for healthy family relationships. All of the reasons above can lead to irreversible consequences, in particular misunderstanding of each other may arise which will definetely lead to disagreements and conflicts. All of these issues will emerge generation gap widening making parents and children strangers or even worse. In conclusion, there various reasons preventing family member to spending time together so the corresponding cases of this situation might occur spoiling their relationships. Because of this, we should always remember that both good relationships between family members and gathering together goes hand-to-hand and that is why we should break any obstacles, arising between us and having an opportunity to spend time with our parents.

It is really big problem. Authors try to find some way to prevent illegal download using law. They say that it is theft and users of this files are robbers.
I agree with them, because before musicians or film producers did something, they work for a long period of time and spend lots of money. For example some films are made by lots of people, and the quantity of money for this films is more than billions of dollars. Of course, authors want to get some money. Secondly, I want to say, that music and films not only work, but also an own idea. Authors made something unique, something new for peoples mind. Thirdly, then musicians or film producers will not get some money, they can not make new master pieces.
From the other hand, people say, that musicians and producers have lots of money and if they download just one films, nothing changed. The other reason, that music, fillms, books are really expensive and not all of people can buy them.
I think that for musicians and producers it is their work and they must get some money. If it is too expensive to buy something, people can go in the cinema or library to get what they need.

Most of them were using a drug that was legal for a long time, but was put on the list of illegal last year, that a lot of athlets did or didn't know about. 
On the other hand, cheating in sport events, such as Olympic games etc. is deffinatly not allowed and should be punished. For instance, there are many examples of athlets cheating, by using drugs, that were disqualified and some time later, after return, were caught again. In this case, punishment should be harder.
In my opinion, both of these examples are horrifuing. I think, that there should be some new, modern sistem and also different rules must be exepted. Moreover, I believe, that by making rules harder the problem of using illegal drugs will be more or less solved.
In conclusion, there are a lot of problems nowadays with illegal drugs that can be solved by changing firstly, the system secondly, people's (athlet's) mindset on these issues. By not allowing people to participate the problem won't be solved so easily. It should be taken very seriously. All in all, in my point of view sportmens should be banned for the first time, but after can be banned for the rest of their lives, depending on the case

Philosophy and religion have been discusing if crime can be linked to sin, while politisians have tried different ways of dealing with it, starting with simply killing the criminal and than inventing different system of prisons.

Not so long ago the question of death sentence was debated furiosly, but nowadays execution looks like attrocity to most people. It brings us to the question of efficiancy of prisons. As soon as they are our own solution, they ought to be helpful, aren't they?
Prisons of Western world are tend to becoming more and more comfortable, providing prisoners television, books, some mind-occupaing work to do, good food and comfortable sleeping place. Critics argue that prisoners' conditions are too good, as they are living on citizens' taxes sometimes better than those citizens themselves. Can this hotel-like system be considered a punishement that leads to redemption? Some say that prison sentence must be as long as possible to force prisoners to otherthinking their behavior and evil deeds in such comfy conditions. They believe that the fear of long enough sentence will prevent people from commiting crimes as the risk will be not worth it.

But such people are not looking at the core. They do not consider reasons that push people to crime. Most in prison are sentenced for robbery, drugs, domestic violence. All these crimes are caused mainly by poor economical and social conditions. It is very convinient for politisans to accuse poor people and portray them as maniacs who threaten wealthy middle class. I do believe that the best way to prevent crime is to work on people's level of life, spend more many not on army but on education and social serveses that can help people in crisis.",65,2,2

But the others think that they must have some possible government restrictions on what they do. Let us start by considering pros and cons of this opinion.
First of all, I want to say that creative artists should always have the freedom in what they do. On the one hand, the creative people can be a reason of technical, social and political progress in the country. They see the world from different side. If we remember the greatest researchers, scientist, writers, politicians, we will see that they have the opportunity to change the world or the country as they want because they can understant more in comparison to common people. On the other hand, if the individual wants to have the estetic pleasure he must do what he likes. But if we have some government restrictions and we do not love what we do it is not good for our mood, nervous and helth. And, besides it, if we want to live in democracy we must be provided with the freedom, especially the artist, that are the representatives their country in the other world.
But there are people who claims that public people have government restrictions on what they do. They say that their freedom can be a reason of the international conflicts as we saw it between Russia and Belarus.
To sum up, I would like to say , that both opinions have their strong sides and I believe that in near future the balance between this two opinions will be found.

But what are the ways to do it and how effective they really are? Some people say that increasing prison sentences is the way to go. People who fear being locked up for a really long time are less likely to commit a crime, they say. This conclusion is fairly easy to come to, but is it really the most humane and effective way? Opposers of such notion say that it is not. As statistics show, many people who were in prison later commited another crime and got into the prisons again. This shows the current ways of sentencing people and working on them in prison are ineffective. Some people propose better psychological work on prisoners, and, later on, giving some help to former prisoners to make their path to normal life easier. Such help may consist of social adoption courses, giving education to people still in prisons, or, maybe, offering work to newly free citizens. As for me , I am closer to the second camp. Making people live in fear and ruining their whole lives due to one mistake may be too harsh. Also, less strict laws may also improve the situation. Recent decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal. For example, greatly reduced overdose count and drug gang activity, which in turn leads to better and happier population. To conclude, there exist several opinions on reducing crime, most of which are legitimate and possible ways to go, so the only possible way to decide is a democratic one, because of pros and cons of all of the ways.

Many people claim that it is nessecary to increase the number of sports facilities and different sport clubs. However, their opponents believe that it would not have big effect on public health. What is more, they support the idea that other measures are need. Who is right? The way I see it, I do not agree with opponents` point of view. To begin with, nowadays, it is not a secret that there are lots of sports facilities and variety of gyms. Every one who want to keep fit can choose any varient of sport clubs and go to there. However, a large amount of sports facilities does not matter that it would influance largely on public health. For instance, if people want to look well and keep fit, they should not limit themselves by only going for the gym. Moreover, you can go to there every day, but it would not lead to satisfies results, whereas people who mix the sport and resort may have the best ones. 
On the other hand, sport is a way to express your feels and look very well. Firstly, sport is indeed popular in many countries, especially in USA, consequently, there is a demand on it. Thus, the increasing of number of sports facilities will improve public health. Secondly, every one wants go to the gym, which is near by his house; so, increasing the number of sport clubs would be a good way. Thirdly, people want to corect not only their stomack, but also lags, hands, etc; thus, it would be great to have a big number of sports facilies, too.

Firstly, a lots of business processes depend on flights and some of them will not function as fast as they could be in case of reducing of air travels. Such situations may lead to economic and financial disoursters which are likely to be more dangerous for population. For instance, in case of unusual situation on stock market top management of investment banks will not be able to come to emergency conference very fast, what can have an awful consequences. Some people claim that such important percons can travel by car on blocked highways with traffic jams. Nevertheless, there is no transport faster than a jet. Secondly, these protectors of humanity should recall the fact that jets are the most safety transport that people have ever made. For instance, in countries with a small amount of flight people use other transport and because of that the statistics of depth during the traveling is worse then in other countries. It means that measures of reducing flight will not have a positive impact as it is supposed to have. At conclusion I would say that in contemporary world people need to have a lots of air travel as they develop very fast and the most fastest way of traveling must be exist.

There are different points of view on this subject. There are strong reasons to agree with this point of view, but I can’t agree completely. 

It goes without saying, that pirating things is a crime, which is stated in law of almost any country, and breaking a law leads to punishment. Many big companies, for example, Disney, have sued other small companies and individual freelance users for downloading and sharing their movies among others for lower price. There is a good reason for it – ones who pirated their movies, made money by selling them to other people. Another argument to punish pirates aren’t by corporation problems, but small ones. If the famous musician loses some money because of illegal copying, she or he still makes a lot of money and stay as popular as she or he was, where smaller artists, so called indimusicians, don’t earn much money and pirating makes their income so low, that eventually they are forced to quit the career. 

On the other hand, illegal pirate copies might do good for some artists. There are quite a lot of people who decide to actually buy a music album or movie disc after listening or watching illegal copy, and they wouldn’t buy it in another way, because they weren’t sure if it is good or not. Also, sometimes media products are overpriced, so some people couldn’t afford it. Of course, these are not essential human needs, but in modern world, where media surrounds society and every individual, it is difficult to resist on psychological level – person feels need in staying tuned. 

In conclusion, pirating music and movies is illegal and should be punished, but there are some reasons why people who do this shouldn’t be judged, by people who don’t, to harsh, as there are some nuances in modern society that lead people to stealing things on the Internet.

But it is unpopular among those of the age of 65 and above (with only 6% of them using this app). LinkedIn is equally used by those of the age groups 18-29 and 65+ with 22% for each of them. The majority of people using this platform are of the age of 30-49 and 50-64 (with 31% and 30% respectively).

This topic has as benefits as drawbacks. In this essay both sides of this problem will be examined carefully. First of all, these international companies force the economy of other country, while relocating their business to it. It helps not only to solve the problem of unemployment but also amends country and encourages it for development and modernization. Some may argue that this does not dive a chance for local companies to grow and become famous. However, I believe that international companies help local ones and maintain them because they are able to share their skills in businesses. Furthermore, these transformations are useful and convenient for companies due to the fact that labour force is ususally cheaper in poor countries. This is an excellent way to save money. For example, during the economical crisis it is possible not to close your business in rich and developed country, but just relocate it to poorer one. From the other hand, spendings for rebuilding and rerunning the business could be higher. In my view, this spendings are smaller than a demolishment of  the business. Nevertheless, it is often claimed that employees from poor countries are being discriminated and have awful conditions at work because nobody could present their interests and fight for their rules. I would say that this is a problem at all companies which employ cheap labour force. But from my point of view, international companies would never afford themselves to discriminate workers because they are often well-known and this aspect will shade their reputation. All in all, I think that relocating the business to poor countries and employing workers from that place has more advantages than disadvantages. This maintain the economy and solve the problem of unemployment poor country. Moreover it is beneficial for international business as it is developing, spreading and saving many via this way.

The question is would this movement bring more benefits or harm to the word. I personally tend to believe that moving the majority of factories to the developing countries has more cans than pros. Firstly, it makes it very difficult for local business to develop because of strong concuration they face. Secondly, the employers often pay minimum of money to the local workers just because they have no alternative work; companies are not concerned with the education of workers or either their carier growth which makes it hard to people to survive in case of flossing the factory, where they are working. Although, some people think that production of goods in developing countries by international companies is beneficial. Main argument for this position is that this moved businesses provide lots of working places for local people and by this they are helping to economics of host countries to develop. Secondly, it should not be forgotten that by using cheap working resourses of developing countries it is possible for salers to produse cheap and available goods for everyone, without losing the quality of products. All in all, there are two different points of view on the problem of the moving business to the developing countries. I strongly believe that it will bring more harm, but surely it has some benefits.

To start with happiness is the feeling of comfort and security. However all people are different and they have different understandings of “comfort” and “security” that is why, it is so difficult to give an explanation of happiness.
Nevertheless, there are some basic factors that are important for achieving happiness. Firstly it is the support of family and friends, personal relationships. A human being is dependent on society and communication. So, it is necessary to have close friends and good family relations. 
Secondly, a person should feel his or her own freedom. It is very important not to be rebel but know that you always have a choice.
Thirdly, it is difficult to imagine happy unhealthy man because a health is one of the most important factors that influence on a person’s attitude to life.
As for me, I remember how happy I was when my little sister was born. I felt close connection with all my family, with my  parents. I was happy for us. I know that she was healthy and that her birth was a conscious decision of my parents. We gathered together and I’m strictly sure we were happy.

By that fact, the proportion of male and female in educational field starts to be an area of interest for research. Is one gender more succesfull in define subject or not and should universities accept the same quantity of man and woman – are the questions that provoke concerns. I fully agree that they have to.
In the 20th century there was a few number of female who were allowed to get a higher education. It should be added that the area of that education was restricted – the woman were not able to become a politician or an economist or even to join military collages as well. Nowadays, obviously, the situation has changed and there are a wide range of succesfull woman, who achieved a lot in those fields, such as Margaret Tatcher or Hillary Clinton. They made a lot for their countries. Moreover, nobody could proofe the fact that man are far smarter in math, chemistry and other complicated disciplines, which demand a high mathematical skills. It is usually expected that woman should prefer languages studying or teaching. Nonetheless, the examples of Marie Kurie and others famous Noble-awarded woman present the fact that both genders are equal in scientific researches and there are no visible reason to decline the applications from female students owing to the fact of sex.
To conclude, I would like to mention that even nowadays the situation is rather different than it was one century ago, some universities carry on accepting more applications from male students in every subject than from females. Although, in civilized European countries the result of accaptance depends only on the state exams marks and not on gender, that gives opportunity to choose students by their educational level ant sorts out the issue of inequality.

But different people have different points of view about the pure goal of using social media. Ones believe that social networks are aimed to information and knowledge sharing, others argue that it first of all just entertainment, in this essay I will look on both sides and provide own opinion. On the one side, first of all, the Internet was created as a place, where people have an opportunity to communicate and share information staying at different points of a world. Of course, social media now develop this idea and let people do it in easy and comfortable way. For example in such sites as Facebook or Vkontakte people can find and enter different interesting community where they will have a chance to communicate with people with the same interests of views. Secondly, social media is a place where people find and share any content that they want from scientific articles to documentary films. Take students as an example: they use social networks as a forum for discutions and bank of materials for studies. On the other side, social networks also play a role of entertainment for many people. It can be communicating with friends or different countries make friends and sometimes Internet frenship becomes more strong then alive. And of course social media represent a place where people can relax: read different stories and, funny pictures, listen to favorite music. For some people it seems a time wasting, but for others it is a chance to take a rest. All things are considered and I partly agree with both sides. I tend to believe that social networks: play multy-fanctional role and everyone decides, how he will rise it. From my point of view the best variant is to strike a balance between using the Internet for entertainment and information sharing.

It is rather challenging and thought-provoking issue which should be taken into account by parents and teachers.

I suppose that an abundance of factors can cause this problem. Firstly, many children receive poor attention from their parents today because both parents usually work full time nowadays. They would like to earn money, however, they forget about attention and care which their child needs. Secondly, such problem can be rooted in spread of video and computer games. Children and teenagers are getting used to cruelty and violence through electonic games. The boundaries between games and reality begin to blur. That is why they transfer actions from games into real life.

Parents and teachers should definetely discuss this problem in detail and come to a common agreement. I can suggest some possible solutions. The first one is to spend more free time with their children, to talk to them and to be interested in their lifes. The second thing which adults can do is to organise special activities for children where they will be under control. With the help of such activities they will learn to communicate with peers and distinguish between real and virtual life.

To conclude it can be said that although the problem is wide-spread today, there are plenty of solutions which can be offered. Parents and teachers should just pay enough attention to it.",70,2,0

So, males and females have equal rights nowadays in all spheares of life. This rule also concerns educational process their all people have a right to have an education, besides, they are free to choose any subject they want. Moreover, is it appropriate for universities to accept  males and females in every subject equaly?
First of all, if we speak of equality of men and women we should make a notice that this also mean that women could not do some work which is not suit them (take heavy things). In other ways it is known that females can choose freely their profession. Secondly, we can easily think of jobs which will be more priority for males such as military professions.
What is the goal of setting the rule when universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject? Will it really provide equality? It is set by the laws that everyone has an opportunity to study the subject he prefers. This rule is enough for the realisation of the principle mentioned above.
Another factor which may be set against that rule is a different propostion of population of males and females in the country. It would be hard to reach equal numbers because women simply can be more than men or overwise, so this argument makes that rule almost impossible.
Of course universities may try to bistribute makes and females during educational process in different groups equaly and that probably will bring positive result. 
To sum up, everyone both males and females has a right and opportunity to choose their profession and study in a place they want. It will not be appropriate for university workers trying to choose students by the criteria of equality of males and females instead of professional qualities and knowledge, which may have every person.

First of all, airplanes affect to our planet and our nature, becouse work of this machines is a cause of air pollution and global problems. We must to keep the Earth for future population and for our children.
The second negative thing about air travel is that sometimes airplanes can be in exident and can be crashed. Unfortunately, it leads to many catastrofes, where many people lose their family.
Besides, every air portes should pay many amount of money for oil. And we know, that not every country has free access to getting oil, and petrol.
But many people don’t think about this problem. Probably, they like to move fast and air travel is the best way for it. Also, they doesn’t want to spend much time for travelling.

Many people claim this situation to have many negative effects. Others argue that pros outweigh cons. As far as I am concerned, the advantages illuminate the disadvantages. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that producing goods in developing countries is cheap. Thus, the producers could invest saved money in upgrading production or inventing new stuff. Secondly, by doing business in poorer countries international companies help to develop their economies. Furthermore, moving businesses abroad provides local workers with jobs which are often hard to find in a developing country. On the other hand, there are some people who argue that replacing business in other countries has more drowbacks. According to their point of view, moving companies production abroad leads to the higher level of unemployment in  a country where this company originates from. However, I can not agree with them as nowadays people living in developed countries have no wish to do unqualified jobs. Moreover, most of these people have a higher education and are able to find more prestigious job. Hence, there is no demand for unqualified workers in developed countries. Talking everything into account I would like to point out that moving international companies’ businesses to poorer countries has more benefits for people living in both developed and developing countries and also for the producers of goods. By placing the business abroad we provide locals with jobs, stimulate their economy and earn more money to develop the production of goods.

But not all people think so. In one view, it is quite logical that longer prison sentences will reduce crime, because more criminals will be in jails so less number of offends will occur. However the history shows a lot of examples of decrease of harmfulness of punishments for criminals. For instance, morality execution is forbidden in all developed countries in contrast to the situation in nineteenths sentury. On the other hand, criminals will do as harsh deals to not  be punished for law breaking as serious punishment. They will get otherwise. Thus, for example, thiefs more likely to kill random citizens who noticed their offends with longer prison sentences. This is very serious and many people that it is th main point in considered dispute. Another important point is the presence of innocent people who was judged because of a court mistake. The prison sentences length increase will make their lives dramatically worse, exactly in slight law break cases. As for me, the disadvantages of suggested method of crime reduction overweigh its advantages. I think that there are a lot of efficient and less bloody methods such alteration of primary school education. In my opinion, it will be supplemented with some law and citizen rights courses. These classes will help to make children understanding the society laws and reasons to not break them. To conclude, I am hardly disagree with the statement that longer prison sentences will reduce crime well.

The facts discover that the number of these crimes is higher nowadays than ever before. I would like to look at the reasons of this terrifying trend and search some adequate solutions for this problem.
It is clear that alcohol and drugs are the reasons of many crimes. From my point of view, advertising and many ways of distribution of both are one of the most important reasons of the crime growth. Many teens and young people addicted to alcohol and drugs become criminals. There is factual evidence that the highest percentage of imprisoners are drug dealers and drug holders. The second reason is a bad financial state of many families and young men. Such negative financial environment destructively influences development of children and teenagers. They become criminals because it is the only way for them to survive and get some money. The third reason is a luck of education. Young men with weak education can not find a well-paid job and meet different life difficulties that can incline them to a criminal path.
As far as I am concerned, each of the reasons is important and should be solved carefully. The best way to deal with alcohol-and-drugs problem is to control students from schools and universities and advertise a good and healthy lifestyle. There should be some control tests among student and undergraduates to indicate drug addiction. Some lessons and sport events should be organized to make active life and sport common among youngsters. The second problem of poverty can be handled through regular revision of families in terms of their financial stability. Children from poor families should be given some financial support. Government should organize different institutions to help young graduates to find a well-paid job. The final reason, lack of education, can be solved through the wide range of different scholarships that will allow young men to go to university. All schools and higher schools should be able to provide some standards of the quality of education so that their student an compete with others.
To sum up, the problem of crime is actual among young people nowadays. This problem can be explained through 3 main reasons: alcohol and drugs, poverty lack of education. Although the problem is difficult, it can be solved through adequate means of the governors and local authorities: a health lifestyle promotion and support of educational programs. We shouldn't close our eyes and should do our best to help young people to choose the right way.

As it has been proved one of the main factors which contribute enourmously to this problem is air travel. That’s why I strongle believe that introducing some laws to reduce the amount of flights must be introduced by government. First of all, a lot of air travel is really unnecessary. Thousand of people use air travel for business and leisure when they can choose another ways to get to their destinations and not to pollute the air. The main reason is that air travel is the fastest, the most comfortable and the most convinient way, but if the government introduce laws that will prohibit such amount of unnecessary flights, people will have to change to more environmentaly friendly ways to travelling and such restrictions will be very effectively. What is more, reducing the amount of air travel will lead to changing people willingness from flying abroad either for business or leisure to traveling to another areas of their own country which does not require airplanes. This will be an intent to the development of national tourism and infrastructure of the towns which in turn will encourage more money in these regions which government later can use to address the problem of air pollution and global warming. To sum it all up, I do think that air travel hadly influences the situation of global warming and air pollution and reducing unnecessary flights will help to solve the problem either in short run and longterm periods.

The century of the technological's developement not always has a good impact. Because of that teenagers have more problems with their mental health which can be causes of all these crimes.
First of all, many of teenages prefer to play different computer games including very aggresive, for example, GTA or DOTA where they can kill people. Sometimes it can make them really dangerous and antisocial, some of them just don't grasp how human life is important. Moreover all these TV shows about politics which have not an age border, in such programms they can see how adult people can be agresssive and can not controll themselves. Sometimes even an old person can not deal with this wild influence on his brain.
I believe that parents need to allow children and teenagers play these games but in a right time and also parents should communicate with their children and offer them to play games like Scrubble or Activity all together like it was in my family. Both parents and teachers need to explain teenagers all these historical and political events gradullay without any overwhelming reactions.

There are a couple of other methods that should be implemented to reduce air pollution to which travelling in planes contributes a lot. At first, it is essential to define which journays can be considered not so necessary and which ones cannot be canceled. Of course, all people belive that their journey is important, but cannot they take it going by bus or by train?
Needless to say that it is much slower and less convenient, but governments should encourage such conscious changes of planes and, for instance, provide cheaper tickets for those who decided not to fly but to drive.
Other possible solution is to reduce the number of personal planes and helicopters of movie, football stars and other famous persons. Because quite offten they use it just for one's pleasure and without any real aim.
Moreover, this problem can also be tackled with cancelling those programm of additional free miles that are given to those people who fly a lot. It will not encourage people to travel by planes but by public transport or by trains.

First of all, should be found the roots of this problem to understand where to start the actions. Many people suggest that crimes amoung teenagers and other youngsters are caused due to lack of education and intellegence. So the first changes should be provided by school teachers and parents who have to teach children the basic rules of discipline. That would help to prevent the expanding of young criminals.

Secondly, another reason for growing crime rates may be caused by absence of working possibilities for teenagers. Some of the young people are willing to have their own money, although, they do not have opportunity to work somewhere, and that may lead them to crimes. Teachers should allow students to be able to do at least paper work which will be payed or help shool with doing some research. Youngsters also can be taken by their parents on a part-time position if there is any so they can get a legal job and salary.

There are a huge amount of causes why young people do crimes. First of all, I suppose that the main reason why the crime activity develops between teenagers is the lack of attention from their parents and teachers, may be they just want to pay that very attention by doing crimes. For instant, children even can become a murder at the age of 15 because they want to be noticed. I consider that it is really importatnt and grown-ups should help young people who has such thoughts.The second reason is different movies about violence and crime.They give children an understanding about the fact that to be a robber or a murder it is normal and then at the everything will be OK , but it is a movie, in real life it is much more serious.

I really believe that parents and teachers need to fight with these causes for example they should respect the children, try them to understand what is good and bad, pay attention to them to everyone individual method of behavior, especially if young person have some problems in family or at school and also go to psychologist with him and not allow to watch TV being a small child.

In my point of view, I am sure that adults need to help youth to deal with their problems and then I guess the youth crimes will be reduced.

Some people say that such social media as Facebook and Vkontakte should provide the opportunity to educate people, others believe that the main goal of these sources are communication and entertainment without any information background. In my essay I will look at the both sides of the argument and give my own opinion. First of all it should be noticed that Facebook and Vkontakte were founded originally as a new means of communication through the Internet. In modern society we have no easier to find and cooperate with different people from all the world as these social media provide us. That is the reason why social networks ensures different types of games and entertain content. On the other hand, most global youth spent time searching in such networks. As it has a huge impact on modern society it should be full of various kinds of respect information to develop people’s medias. Furthermore, almost all media resources have their accounts in Vkontakte or Facebook as it is the smallest way to spread their thoughts to people. The twice phenomenon of globalization and communication techiques development have leaded to the fact that internet social media are the most popular way of getting knowledge and information. Personally, I believe that there should be a required proportion of serious and light information provided by social networks for every user, as it depends on an individual’s personals needs and desire.

Some people believe that it is normal that in some subjects there is a majority of girls while other disciplines are mostly studied by boys. But there is an opinion that in every subject the number of males and females should be the same.

On the one hand, it is commonly accepted that in technical and economical subjects the most number of students is male and in humanitarian subjects, such as history and linguistics girls keep most places. People suppose that it is natural and for boys it is easier to study math than phylology and the opposite for girls. Moreover, it is hard to change this situation because it is historically sustained stereotype. Also some conservative persons are sure that such a division can help students to be more consentrated on their studying and science career.

On the other hand, in a modern world we can see great changes in gender priorities and specialisations. Nowadays there is a bigger number of males in humanitarian area while females conquire technican universities. This fact shows that the difference is not so fatal and it is not a question of gender what subject is better for your studying. The other fact is that studying were there is an equal number of women and men can be more interesting and share more different views and new ideas in well-known science areas, which can do the studying process more amusing.

To sum up, I must say that although it is normal that the number of males and females can differ in subjects, universities should try to accept equal number of girls and boys because it can have positive results in studying and creation of a family in a further life after the university. It is a right of every student to choose his or her specialisation of interests.

All of our knowleges, all of our ideas – everything of it is information. It can be sound strange, but art is information too. Today technologies – our best friend and with their help we can do everything.
Also we can find products of art in the Internet and download it in the only click. But not everybody think, that it’s always good.
Some people assume, that Internet – users must use only legal ways to find and take information – buy it on oficial sourses. They say, that creators of films and music lose huge amounts of money because of i-pirates and pirate copies. So, if we want to help people we like, we should give them some money for their works. That is their first argument. The second is that it’s totally unfair, to use easy and cheap ways and use someone’s work without fee. In addition, they think, that unfair people should be punished for their internet crimes.
Another part of people use pirate copies and of course they don’t want to be punished. They don’t pay money because, at first, it’s so expensive and not everybody can allow his to himself. Secondly, most things, that they download, don’t have their author alive and they won’t receive money. This money can take children or other people, who are unfair in this case too.
As for me, I think, that I needn’t pay for information I need, because it’s the main sourse in our life. If I had more information, I can share and grow it, it’s more useful for everybody. So I think, that we can solve this problem by lowing prices and having new rules of internet purchases.

There are two points of view: some people believe, that the best method to improve the health of nation is by increasing the number of sport facilities. Others consider that there are more effective ways. Firstly, I want to think about the second point of view. Actually, big quantity of sport facilities like football pitches, places for people who want run or ride a bike and so on gives an opportunities to citizens for increasing health. And this system works for part of population which is ready to practise short. From the other hand, somebody believes that there are more effective ways. For instance, it can be the social advertisement which shows that smoking an alcohol do harm to our health; or some other advetisement for health way of life. It can help for people,and also it predict bad habits of teenagers. By the way, prediction of bad habits is not the health way of life. In my opinion, the advertisement and increasing of sport facilities must work together and it is the best method to omprove public health. If population will understand that sport in necessary for their health, and wiil start practise football or fitness, the level of public health will soar. Now, we have sport facilities, but do not see result: this system works for people who want and who is ready to do something with himself. The goal of government is do the sport popular between everybody. To sum up, I want to say that two opinions has advantages and disadvantages, that is why we must realize perfect system which will improve national health by force of every effective methodes.

Some people agree that piracy should be punished and others should pay for this content or to be punished for download. This essay argues with this statement.

First of all, prices for the original discs often are too high to buy them. Most of people all other the world are poor and cannot afford to buy every song of film they want. That is why they cannot improve their skills at something but some films can help. Secondly, the websites have money for watching and download the content that people are interested in. If people will pay for everything, they will not often buy songs and films because of the lack of finances. Musicians and film producers will lose more money than before.

Nevertheless, a lot of people agree that everything connecting with piracy should be punished. Such people prefer to buy films and songs because of good quality of information. They have enough money to pay for it and likely good salaries. Among these people are producers and musicians because they lose their money but want to get more benefits for their work. People who collect something also prefer original discs to pirate copies.

To sum up, I completely disagree that people, who download music and films on the internet for free, should be punished for this. Most of the world population are poor and cannot buy this content. Of course, producers lose money but they can use piracy for good purposes. For example, they can make a website with their products and they will take more money for their followers. Moreover, free download is a good stage for rising popularity. And popularity brings money.

Finally, it is not good for people who can not tolk with othe people.

People use gadgets everywhere and every minute of their lifes. It may cause such evident problems as, for example, eyes problems, headaches. Moreover, people have great amounts of information they have to deal with, which can be the reason of information overload. Watching TV too much, surfing the Internet for so long makes people feel tired and completely exhausted. They may even not notice these effects, but they do exist. One more problem caused by widespread of modern technologies is damaging the mental health. People watch TV programmes – that demonstrate violence, conflicts, killing of people and animals. All these things, however, make a negative effect on people’s mind. They become more nervous, aggressive and uncontrollable. People can stop control themselves and become dangerous for others, for the society. 

Although, the influence of modern technologies is quite big, the problems caused by the latter can be solved. Firstly, some time reshictions should by introduced. People should not use gadgets so much time. Secondly, programmes shown on TV, or uploated to the Internet should be censored more strictly. Finally, people should spend more time outdoors doing sports to improve their health. 

All in all, the problems of too big influence of modern technologies on people’s health is very serious and must be solved as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the circumstances will be catastrophic.

Well, this is very hard problem to solve, because in our world there would always be persons who have some deiseses or genetical malfunction, so they would need our help or our money. Let’s speak about ways of earning of money. A lot of people just take pictures with their “problem” and sit on the floor and ask for money. I think, that the exposion in museum, when you buy ticket and money from each one will go to charity bills, is a great way to earn money for charity.
I agree that some schools should have time community service because, for example, when you teach little boy how to play football you learn some positive characteristic such as: how to be a leader, how to work in team, how to communicate with unknown people, and it is very useful type of character in your future.
On one hand it is very good to improve your skills to learn something now, to become more social, but on other hand someone may don’t like to do such work, other one would rather ride a bicycle than work for charity.

It is an interesting solution and I think it can work because any prison sentences has a positive impact on prisoners. If prisoners will be situated in special places longer, they can change their mind and learn some profession, which helps our society. But longer sentences with such programs, so expensive governments and it can will be a problem for states economy. That’s why, this solution can use only a poverty countries. On the other hand, others believe that we should image a alternative ways of reducing crime. In my opinion, government need divide a prisones depends on their case and we most dangerous prisoners must be killed. According to statistics, the contries, where death penalty is allowing has a less crime percentage rather states, which do not use it but, death penalty is non-ethical and many countries and people will never use this solve. It mean that problem is staying an solving. From my point of view, hard rules also can increase a crime percent ages. For example, huge taxes on priosner’s family will have a waste impact on people. To sum up, I would say that a longer prison sentences is not a single solution. Fro crime problem with developing of our society people will find a way to make a crime, but also I believe that another persons will always search an alternative ways of reducing crime.

Personally I think that athelts, who take drugs mus be banned on a some perod. There are some causes for it.
Firstly, sport education very expinseve for goverment. It's million dollars and many time. So if you bann professional athletic in competition for all him life, you can destroy state
Secondly, people who ate drugs can say that it was the biggest error in their life and they wont take drugs. So if sportsmen whant begin their life without drugs we can help them. So one of type of help to this people is a chance to take part in competitions.
On the other hand we can see that excluding from competition for all live is necesarry because sometimes goverment help to athletes take drugs. Also govermen help athletes to crush tests which must show drugs in blood of sportsmen. For example we can say about problems with our sportsmen in last year when all world know about drugs in Russian sport. Also, some athletic eat drugs after punishment and they whant stop do it. So in this case excluding from competitions on little period cant solve this proplem.

He says that it is the politician's task to tako some measures in order to reduce the number of air travel. 
As for me, I'm totally disagree with this statement. Because, on the one hand, airplanes threw some gases to the atmosphere, and it can damage the ecology. But it is well-known fact that the most of flight companies ude ecological fuel for their airplanes, as a rule, cerosine. And the damage effects from using this kind of fuel are much less than the pollution, providing by using cars, working manifactures, e.t.c. It's proved by scientists that airplane fuel is more ecological in many times than gasoline, or gases that factories give to the air. So, they came to the conclusion that using cars can give our planet much more damage than using air transport. Becaue the most of gases, which is left by airplanes in the air don't get down to the Earth, but mix with air on the level of around 10000 metres.
As for the global warming, I can say that there are a lot of another reasons for it. Last saturday I saw a documental film ""The Global warming"" on the Discovery TV-channel. And there were not any words about the damage effect of using airplanes! But producers gave a lot of arguments that the main reasons of global warming are gases from factories, too much cars using by people and the global changes in world's climate.

A lot of talanted people loose there money, because it’s easy for everybody to find the new film or song in the internet instead of buying it.

I agree with the opinion that people making free pirate copies must be judged. Money that must be payed for masterpieces of talanted musicians, actors, producers are the salary for them. If there is no salary it’s better for a person to change his job just to get some money. In 90th a lot of young musicians stopped their repetitions and concerts because of terrible lack of money. Now nobody knows about there great talent. So, we have the risk of repeating. Secondly, the process of creating new movie or a song is not so cheap like it seems to be. Producers waste a lot of money in order to get more after the first night. And what to do if you can’t get your money back? Also the quality of shared copies is always not so good. Allfilms and music are firstly made the audience to enjoy it. Bad quality can turn all the pleasure you could got into nothing.

But there is also a lot of people who thinks in another way. For them shared internet copies is an ordinary thing which can make our life easier. They are sure that the easier access to culture can make it more popular between young people. Also they say that you never know if the song or a film is good, may be it’s not worth paying. For example, there can be a situation when you don’t like the movie, but you’ve already payed for a ticket to the cinema and it harder to leave it. Moreover a lot of people who can’t pay for a disc with music or a ticket to the cinema free internet copies become a great opportunity to get into culture and to be in trend.

Finally, I can say that in both extents there are pros and cons, but only government can choose to stop pirate copying and sharing or not to stop.

Thus, there are widespread debates on measures against those competitors who were caught on it. Some people believe that such sportsmen should be penalized for some time, for instance, for two years, whereas others assert the necessity to ban the violaters from competing professionaly forever.
To begin with, it s wortwhile to remember that professional sport is a specific lifestyle. Therefore, the decision to bond the life with it implies the responsibility, one might make an inner agreament with the rules of this society. This provoke the idea that the athletes caught, should be banned from participating in the competitons for the rest of their lives. Virtually, this opinion is based on the term of ""professional honesty"" that is extremly significant in any professional area.
Otherwise, as the famous quote says ""I am a man and nothing human is foreign to me"". All people make mistakes and one false step might be punished but should not occur to be the fatal in someone's life. Even gads provide the opportunities to alter the views and undertake a novel attempt. Such a stance breed the idea of a part-time ban.
To summarize, the use of illegal drugs in sport is a pertinent issue to discuss as the professional sport requires the respect to others and the responsibilities for decisions, but at the same time everybody is reckoned to have a right on mistake. As far as I am concerned, those punishments should be only for some time as sometimes people do not realize that they are doing on the way to their dream. To conclude, it is necessary to tackle the problem, but it would be better to do it among the people connected with this kind of activities.

Copying and sharing music or films on the internet is theft and people who download these files, instead of buying the original discs, should be punished. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

First of all, in modern age of internet and technologies people have fun in many ways and the most popular way is sharing music and films on the internet. 

In the first place in this question should take into account the act, that many people can’t afford to buy music or film. These people suppress their need with downloading and sharying films or music on the internet. These way, of course, is the most easy and comfortable. 

But if you look from the producers and musicians it brings huge loses. Imagine that you did a great job and in the end you did not receive suffycient payment for these work. In this situation, anyone would feel cheated because any work and job, especially creative must be paid. After all, the creativity and arts bring people pleasure and very good to relax.

In the end, I am of the opinion that the films and music should be online, but it should not cost so much. Most often, the person comes to pay site and sees a large amount of licensed movie and thinks that the money he could to go and see that film at cinema. Therefore, I agree that online films and music can be pay, but they aren’t be so expensive.

The main reason for this should probably be, that USA and Great Britain are basically the countries where film industry was created, and so it has thrived and developed for a very long time there. But when the countries which didn't develop their industry try to simply copy the work and the methods of western movie giants, they are doomed to fail. Because making a work of such high quality demands one to be experienced.
Of course, one can blame the governments for not funding their own film industry and giving local movies extra time in the theatres, which in their opinion is the only true reason for being worse than West.
I certainly can't agree with such a position. First of all, my country does fund the movies, but as holds for any sort of funding, especially in the art, which movies are a kind of, one can't expect the final product to be great, if one invested their money unwisely. Which is exactly what happens in my country. It's actually a matter of finding good crew. As is apparent in my country all of the normal script writers seem to be doing something else. Because the main weakness of our movies is their scripts. It's actually even more bizarre considering all the money invested.
As to sum up, maybe governments indeed should give more financial support to film industries, but they should certainly do so with great caution, as we have already seen the sad results of unwisely invested money.",75,2,2

The majority of people agree that athlets, who use illegal drugs, should be banned from competing. The aruing goes around the period of bannng: some claims that it should be limited while the others insist on banning for the rest of their lives. In this essay both points of view would be examined carefully.
On the one hand, athlets should not be punished very hard for their mistakes. There is no denying the fact that drug using is a criminal, however all people deserve the second chanse. For many sportsmen doing their sports and taking part in professional competitions is thee only way to make money for their life. In this occasion, being banned forever could cause what is called ""knock-on effeckt"" with depression, alcogolism, drug abuse and even another criminal ways of living. In this situation, temporal punishment seems like better way. What is more, athlets are not always responsible for using illegal drugs. Sometimes their couches could give it to them in secret or their enemies.
On the other hand, as the english saying goes: once a liar - forever a liar. People who cheat once could do it again, despite the period of banning. Moreover, professional sport competing is an extremely moral area whith a high standarts of honesty and strick approach to punishment. Taking this argument into account, many professional athlets could refuse to compet with someone, who were caught using illegal drugs.
Personally I think that all this arguments are fair. As for me, the best solutions could be found by two-steps approach. When athlet is caught using illegal drugs for the first time, he banned from competing only for short-lasting period, for example, two years. Then, if he caught for the same thing the second time, he would be banned for the rest of his lives.
To conclude, the use of illegal drugs in sport is relevant issue nowadays. To grapple with this problem all points of views should be taken into account. I think it is unfair to banned person forever for his first catching using illegal drugs, because this could ruin his life. However, if he do this crime again, banning from competing professionally for the rest of his life would be the most fair solution.

To begin with, I would like to say that planes pollute atmosphere because only engine that introduce oil to fly pollute oxygen such reagents like 2O and H2O. but we can not do anything with this. Also people need to fly because it is a very convenient way of transport. From pluses we can add that we move faster appearance at other place when we could not to get on car or train. This transport have done our life easily and more comfortable. New people that can not be theirs family for years can do this if they had some time and money for flying. We live in industrial world and each men must know that our atmosphere will not forever be clean and fresh. That’s why government of each country must introduce laws to air travel companies there they will not sue bad oil to engine. Actually, I think that director of air trance company must do special programmes that will clean reagents from plants.  If this programme will work that must be helpful to atmosphere. To sum up, I often use air travel because I am not from Moscow and my native city is about 3000 km. I can not use other transport like train or bus because it is inconvenient and you will pay more money to get to your home. That’s why I partly agree with point of view that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business.

It means that countries often focus on products, which easier to make exchange with other regions and after it have variety of food. However, some people claim that it’s wrong way, they believe that country should import as little as possible. I absolutely disagree with this opinion. In my essay I’ll try to explain why I think so.

Firstly, it’s doubtless, that we can’t do everything perfectly, but when we need to do just a few things instead of great amount, it’s easier to achive good quality. So, I believe that it’s good idea to share what you can do and take what others can do. It can makes relationship between countries better. And there is a probability that if you don’t want to buy something, then you can’t sell own production. It is bad for economic of country. 

The second argument in favor of my point of view is people’s health. Humans need in different types of food to provide own well-being. But if countries don’t make an exchange, you haven’t some products with special consistence. For example, in countries where always cold temperature there are no any plants and it is bad for people, they don’t get a lot of necessary vitamins. 

In conclusion, I’d like to add, that people shouldn’t afraid of cooperation of countries, it is always good to have close and kind relationships. Moreover, it would be interesting for us to have such opportunity to try the best products which other countries can make.

To begin with, it is known that there are people who believe that social sources such as Facebook and Vkontakte are primarily educational and information sources. In these networks there a lot of groups or mini-societies which provide interesting news and valuable knowledge. It goes without saying that is better than to provide horrible stories or anti-government content. Also it can help to develop our children because nowadays there is a bad tendency. It means children don’t care about how to gain knowledge or education. To support this point of view. I will give an example. Every day during one hour skim through the news in  Vkontakte. That’s why I know about all current events in my current and abroad. On the other hand, there are supposters of another point of view that the main goal of social networks is to entertain people. So, people would like to relax for hard work day or youngsters want to spend time after school or after gym, plaing games on the Internet. In this case, social networks are able to provide this opportunity. However, there a lot of people who want to communicate with friends and talk about their experience or simply to listen music. It isn’t bad, so social media as Vkontakte can provide even this possibility. It should me mentioned that there is disadvantage of this possibility, namely that youngsters in many cases spend too much time, plaing games, listening music or talking with their friends. For instance, I am a sophomore of HSE and I every day spend nearly one hour for and this doesn’t demage me in conclusion, it should be mentioned that all people can share different point of view on this topic. As for me, I consider that it isn’t necessary to divide purpose and goals of social networks for entertainment purpose and information sources. I believe that every social media source can combine all these purposes as  this will be more comfortable for consumers. It means that it is after your favourite online-source provides you with entertainment, information and knowledge.

Some people believe that there is no need for a very strict punishment for it: the sportsmen should not be allowed to compete for 2 years. Others are suppose that punishment for such cheating should be less mild: such athletes might not compete for the rest of their lives.
So, the first opinion is that such unfair method of winning the games is not something criminal. They are suppose that everyone has its own right for mistake. For example, somebody can be too young to understand he is doing a wrong way using the illegal drugs, but after a ban for 2 years he will understand that he should not do such things.
The second opinion is that the cheating in professional sports is cruel and it should be punished very strong. If one have cheated, he should not have a chance to take part in professional sport anymore. Nevertheless it is not very democratic, it will be a good way to preserve unfair competition.
As for me, I totally agree with the first opinion. However the use of illegal drugs in athletics is awful, it is just a mistake that can be forgotten if the athlete does not breaks the law anymore. We all do the wrong things in our lives; so do the athletes. The matter if one accepts ones mistakes and then doing right.
To conclude, the athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned for sure, but they need the chance to make their reputaton good again after the punishment period.

Moreover, there are lots of films and musics appeared in Internet in illegal was. Some people consider that it is a crime, but others use them with a pleasure. 

Nevertheless, I disagree with people, who think that is the theft. First, buying the original disc of music and films are highly expensive. Moreover, our Internet provides a lot of possibility to watch films of listen music in the cheapest way or for free. Furthermore, it is very hard to wait for the appearing of new  film on disks, which is very popular in society. Therefore, the production of disks cannot race with surfing Internet. 

There is a second side of this problem, that our society was depend on financial possabilities. There are a huge amount of people who cannot satisfy their needs or make themselves happy. For example, I have some friends, which can not allowed themselves to go to the cinema for many times. Although, it is quite easy to download for free this film. There is another positive point for the unguiltiveness of pirates and who use their files is that some newest films and songs are decreased in level of intellectual idea. For example, our film production consists of silly comedies for the most. Therefore, some films are not satisfy after seeing them in the cinema. In this case, there is a perfect solution to solve the problem is to download them for the cheapest way at home for the internet. Moreover, this is the best decision to upward your mood. 

To sum up my mind, I believe that downloading films and music is not a serious problem in our world, according to pollution, unemployment or other crimes. Sometimes it has a positive effect on mood of people. In my opinion, these theft cannot be compared to crime life violeness or killers. We live in modern world and Internet is a part of our life.

Instagram, Facebook, Vkontakte and many others. There are two opinions on the issue of what is he main idea of those social network must they be informative or must they be a source of entertainment. Those points of view differ considerably and would be covered in this essay. The first point of view says that social networks should be informative and give people knowledge. These who support this viewpoint claim that those social networks must let people get educated on-line by receiving some extra information and knowledge they didn’t know before. Another opinion on that issue is that social network must entertain people not teach them. It is widely known that most of those webpages such as Facebook and Vkontakte were created with and idea of quick chatting with your friends and sending pictures, videos and music to have a pleasant time with your friends even if they are for away from you. As for me, I think that social networks must both be informative and entertaining as they are now. Take Vkontakte as an example. There are a lot of groups in Vkontakte which content different informative from scientific public pages and groups on literature to groups with funny picture memes or different videos which aim to make people laugh. All these groups make Vkontakte a unique website where everyone can choose for himself whether to get knowledge or be entertained. To sum up it is very important to note that both of these viewpoints desire a chance to exist. However, only the combined idea of those two sides suits me most.

Therefore, there is a gap of about 40 million people between desktop and mobile users in 2013. The majority of women use Facebook in order to send media information like photos and videos.

Some people believe it is not worthy activity. From my point of view, it is rather useful hobby because of various reasons. In my essay I will discuss how it helps to develop relationships and improve a person's mood.
Firstly, very often people watch matches with their friends and relatives or even if they watch them alone, they have somebody with whom he/she could discuss games. That is why they have more common topics, discussing matches they build emotional link. For example, my friends are great football fans and they root for the same team. So after every game they gather and discuss it very emotionally.
Secondly, watching sports can improve your mood. When the team wins fans feel proud for it. Even if it fails, the game brings a lot of emotions and it can make person's life more interesting. Additionally, if a person does not root for any of teams, he/she can enjoy tight games. For example, my brother is a fan of one basketball team, he always waiting for its matches badly, he is extremely happy at that period. While and after watching he has a great range of emotions.
In conclusion, I would like to say that of course every thing has both advantages and disavantages, but we should not forget that hobbies have a lot of social benefits, and observing of sports is not an exception. Sports can help people to make friends, to kill time, and experience a lot of emotions.",60,2,1

So, for instance, we use mobile phones not only for calling, but also for reading books or surfing on different web-sites and social networks. By doing this regullary our eyes become weaker. The same situation is with computers, which we use for work or even games. The other problem is that every device produce special rays, which are really harmful for humans, because they may cause hazards diseases such as cancer. Moreover, it is because popular listen to music with earphones very loud, this may cause serious problems with ears and you might even became def. 

There are lots of ways how to solve this problem, but it wouldn’t work if people isn’t follow the rules. For example, to make your eyes stronger you should spend about 20 minutes on special exercises for eyes. You should also listen to music on a lower mode or without earphones. In case with rays, you should spend less time around such devices and spent more time walking with friends.

From the one hand, everyone should respect such talented people as musicians and producers who provide us with really useful things for our relaxing or scientific satisfying. Thus, they must have a right to be paid for their work and users of the Internet who download pirate files should be punished for illegal enjoyment. Furthermore, the copying and sharing music or films in of non-original form lead to deteriorating of the products’ quality. The reason of it can be films recorded on videocameras from cinemaparks or music, recorded on the concerts. In such way it seems that people of art producing really waste their money to create a good proffesional picture or sound.
On the other hand, in the era of developing technologies it is really convenient to use social networks or specialized applies as a platform to store music compositions or films. Thus, many people are ready to commit a law and have a free wealth. However, this problem is decided by Apple corporation which has a huge music resource free for three months. Moreover, there is a problem of people’s equality. It is considered that everyone should have a right to use a wealth which is made and prepared to public. So, it should be available not only for those people who have a financial opportunity to pay for listening for a music or watching films.

One of them is a question about pirates who download and share files with other people in the Internet.

There are a lot of people who use illegal content and they know it but pirates save our money and it is the main reason for them. Furthermore, it is much comfortable to watch new movie at home from the illegal sources than go to the cinema and spend time and money for it.

It is true but we also have musicians and film producers who lose many money. I think it is quite normal when you go to the supermarket and pay money for products. It is the same situation! All of us should understand that songs or films are products too and when you don’t pay for it you are a thief. Furthermore, when you buy music or films it has a good quality, you don’t need to wait when pirates download it to Internet and sometimes producers give some gifts for fair customers. I think that our politicians shall support producers of content and to increase punishment for pirates however it is not always help.

In the age of new technologies it is a very important to fight with pirates. Each content producer lose money which he can spend to new quality film or record of song or album. I totally argree with those who think that such things should be punished. Thief must be in prison.

Creative people have another structure of work than people who are, for example, work officer, engeneer or doctor. They must have a lot of time for their work, because if government wants a good film, a good concert, a good library with a lot of beautiful books, a brilliant exibition or another art event, it takes some times. For example, if people need to open art gallery, they will found of artists, whose picture will be in this gallery. And this artist must preper ther pictures for it and he need in time. Also singer must preper some list of song for a big performance.


However creative artist must have some restrictions. They are people of art and they must give a good example for people who are not creative, but want know something about art and also for children. Creative people shouldn't use bad actions and words or something else in their arts that can have bad influence on people who are interested its.


In my opinion, creative people have very big influence on local population, local culture and foreign people. They must give a lot of good information which can do people more kind, clever, developed and creative, so they must have some restrictions.

First of all, if the company desides to move they business to poorer country, company’s product will cost less, compared with the situation when the company locates in the any European country or American for example. However, in the real situation, it is clear that quality of production is worse.

Local workers can’t control quality of cosmetics which have a world name. as a result many people, who used this cosmetics, have a problem with they skin.

Nowadays people are keen on doing that, because it is one of the best ways to decompress after hard-working days. Someone prefers to watch a foreign comedy, while others are fond of local films, but the amount of latter decreases steeply.
I strongly believe, there are several reasons for this phenomenon. First and foremost, the USA and the UK are one of the most famous countries in the producing of films. Actually, their films are popular and they are shown all over the world. So, we can watch it even uncounsciously by switching on a TV or visiting a cinema, because there are plenty of such films everywhere. More than that, these countries invest a huge amounts of money in film's production. So, their films are made with a high professionalism, amusing costumes and backgrounds and the most world-wide famous actors. It all attracts watchers from the whole world. It is also undeniable, that the plot and scenes of British and American movies are more exciting. While, as for Russin films, their plots are rather monotonous and repeat from movie to movie. So, they become rather boring to watch and feel like routine. Additionally, we can get acquainted with different cultures, get to know their traditions and mental features through watching foreign films. I am absolutely sure, it makes people watch tese films, because not everyone has an opportunity to travel round the world, to see all the amazing places of our Earth, to meet new people and to make friends. But films allow them to ""touch"" and to look at the other cultures and absorb in their atmosphere.
Speaking about governments' financial support of their national films, I claim, that it is a must. Due to their investments local films will definetely become more dazzling, exciting and interesting. People from other places all the world will be able to expand their knowledge about the certain country. Furthermore, wathcing films made about local places attract these people as a tourists, as if they can see all the beautyness of a country, they definetely want to visit it. So, it can lead to the profit of the country's budget.
All things considered, British and American films are more perferable because of their professional production, exciting plots, amazing decorations, amusing costumes and famous actors. And locally produced films should be invested by the governments to be at the same level with such films.",75,2,5

Some people argue that a life experience is likely to have more influence on a personality.
In my opinion, the experience is quite more significant factor. To start with, even if a person is talented it is not necessary that he will be successful. This means that should somebody recognize that he seems to have a special talent he would better develop it to achieve some results. For example, musicians who are like to become great professionals but do not pay enough attention to rehearsals often do not show stellar results. What is more, if a person has some disadvantages that appear to be harmful for him and hid surrounding, he should try to do him best to correct these drawbacks. For instance, the son of my mother's friend used to be aggressive when he was a child but by developing himself he has grown up into a quite and patient man.
Nevertheless,there is another point of view. It is said that our basic characteristics are more important than everything that we experience in our life. Contrary to this statement, there are two arguments. Firstly, people are always able to develop themselves in the way that they want so it is possible to improve some skills. Secondly, a lot of different situations that are able to have an influence on own personality can occure.

I think it happends because of two reasons namely unemployment among youth, migration.
It is well known that unemployment among young people is higher than among other ages. In some countries this difference is not very big, but in Spain, Greece etc. the number of young people who have no job is catastrophicaly high. So some of this people commit crimes to get money, some of them are rich enough, but they have nothing to do. Lack of activities forces this guys to join radical groups (like nazi, antifasists etc.). To diminish influence of this factor goverment needs to provide economical grows in order to decrease unemployment.
The second reason is migration. The majority of immigrants come from less civilized countries without strong traditions of law-obidience, so migrant comit crimes much more freqiently than natives. But also we know that migrant usually are young males (who want to find better job).
So boom in migration causes increase in number of crimes commited by young people. I think that government must prohibit immigration from uncivilized countries and accept only educated and law-obidient migrants.
The third reason is that youth is less moral and less religions than their parents. Unfortunately this problem cannot be solved without abandoning distructive ideology of liberalism.
All in all, I think that criminalization of youth can be stopped if government really want it.

So some people are convinced that governments ought to take measures on reduction of the amount of air travel to stop air pollution and global dimming. From my point of view, such environmental problems are crucial nowadays, however I believed that they should be solved in some. Other ways, not by cutting down the  flights. First of all, air traveling is one the major means of transport these days. A lot of people every day travel all around the world for various cases.

In this essay I am going to write about the most powerful causes and try to make some suggestions how to deal with this problem.
First of all, the biggest problem is that children have bad influence from TV shows, computer games and social networks. There are a great number of online and computer games, where you have to grap banks and kill people. Teenagers think that it is a good way to make money with crimes. Moreover, children kill people in computer games and it makes them agressive. About ten years ago, children did not have this opportunity to use computer every day, that is why they spent time with friends outside and play ""children games"". As a result, these games make them addicted and they want to make crime in a real life.
Secondly, children have a lot of free time and they start to use internet very early. There are many online websites which force young people make crime. These groups make teenagers agressive and children think that it is normal to do crime for money or for your own reasons.
It is really difficult problems to be solved. Firstly, children should make sport, it will help them full there free time. Moreover, when you make sport you can find good friends who have the same interests as you are, communicate with them and spend your free time together on different sport competitions.

As regards to me, I believe that rules and restrictions kill creativity and in this essay I will explain my point of view, using some examples from life.


At first, people in governments usually do not understand species of art at all. They are not competetive in this shere and can not be experts in questions of art. For example, nowadays in Russia some of modern exhibitions are closed because governments thought that they are bad and dangerous for people's minds. I find it really dissapointing.


Another argument for artists' freedom in work is that is the main feature of art process – creating something new. Art is always developing, new kinds and forms of it born every day. So how can governments and political organizations control it? It is evidence that in countries with strict art control and cenzure (like China and the North Corea Republic) art doesn't develop nowadays.


Meanwhile, artists should look at themselves too and do not produce things, which are evidently harmful for people. It is a difficult question and maybe sometimes official control is relevant. But the best way for artists is to make this control themselves.


To sum up, I really believe that government restrictions are not necessary, in the vast majority of these questions. Political and social control kill art and developments in this shere.

As for me, I can’t agree with this statement. I think, that all countries should produce the food as for their population ad for import in different countries as much as possible. Firstly, not every country stands in good economical situation, so, they should increase import food or something else abroad, and sell it for biggest price then in their own countries. Secondly, there are some countries, which produce not so many kind of food or does not produce it. So, how such a countries can stand not in crysis, that is why more developed countries must share their food product with others. It will help both countries: which import will earn money, while another can buy food and decided their own people,. 

Thirdly, it is really comfortable, because you can eat what you want, you just need to go to the supermarket and buy, for example strawberries in winter, which were imported from Thailand or somewhere else. In addition, it is right to help less developed countries, because your country can import them food, when they can produce and import something useful for your country.

In conclusion, I would like to say, that every human has their own opinion, but governments have to make right decisions, which will help their countries to make a stable economical situation. That is why many countries should import food as much as possible

Some people tend to think that people who connected with copying, saving and sharing illegal copies should be imposed punishment. I completely disagree with this point of view.
Firstly, rapid spreading of free copies of films and music is one of the steps to the world where culture destination of the planet is acceptable to everyone. Free access to music and films it is a good chance to enjoy beautiness, improve taste and become more educated even foe those who can’t afford to go to cinemas, concert halls and buy CDs or DWDs.
The second argument is that trying to catch all who is connected with illegal copies of films and music it is a wasting of time and money. In the modern internet “pirates” can easily hide themselves. File that was deleted will be recover again soon. Much more productive is to make payment for internet a little bit higher and send part of this money to producers and musicians. Moreover producers of mass media still receive huge amount of money from films in cinemas and big concerts of musicians. People don’t stop to bring money them.
To draw a conclusion I should say that world receive from spreading free copies of media products more than lose. Producers still go in profit, but people have more access to culture destination.

Causes of it may vary from economical structure to family issues, but solving this problem require well-thinked measures from government, help and appreciation of parents, wit advices from teachers - in other words, from all sides of our society.
First of all, people are not born criminals - they become gangsters and thieves for some reason. One reason may hide in economics: younger generations face complicated economical issues, such as lack of working places, low salaries, high tuition and overall decrease of temps of economical growth. Without help of parents or government it's really hard to find a work that can make you living. High tuition restricts poor people from education and lower their chances of good salary in young age. Let's not forget that number of working places for unskilled employees is falling because of robotisation. In such unfriendly economical situation some people start to hijack cars or sell drugs just to survive. Almost all governments are creating policies to help these people and save them from criminal world, and this actions result in lower crime rates. However, free education and healthcare is not enough.
Relations with parents are complicated among teenagers, and this can create problems in the future. Parents should not only take care of their children's material supply, but also of their psychological comfort. To speak to a teenager often means much more than spend more time at work to earn more money for family. Modern teenagers don't have large problems with socialization - social networks and videogames made it easy, but they need an influence from elder, more experienced people, not only peers. Parents should take care of souls of their children, not only school. It's also important for grown-up children, even adults need support some times.
Schools are important too. They can't replace parents and loving family, but they can help young people to accept the values of a honest man. Teachers shall care more about personalities of students, not their marks. Higher wages for teachers can attract high-quality professionals in schools, with psychological approach to teaching. It will be a hard work to find individual approach to everyone, but good teacher will do it and give an advice in hard moments.
What is also important is the fact that criminals often commit crimes even after they were caught once. To avoid recidives parents shouldn't distance from children if they made a mistake for example, drug addicts give up their addiction much easier if supported by family.
All in all, crimes commited by young people are serious problem, but it can be tackled. Policies of helping younger generation to find their place in life are important, but we need much more. Parents should take care of their children's psychological condition, be open for discussion and ready to help. Teachers should care about their pupils too, because in case of family problems of secrets from parents students will need their support. With participance of all members of society we can build a bright, safe and crimeless future.

As for me, space exploration is more important than solving environmental issues. It is more urgent because space exploration can help scientists to get some new knowledges about the environment on the Earth. For example, something about atmosphere. Consequently, it might help the government to find new solutions to the urgent ecological problems on our planet, such as air pollution or the extinction of animals because of bad conditions in forests or on fields.
In addition, one of space exploratoin's issues is to find appropriate living conditionds on other planets. If the scientists could find it, people could move to another planet, where environmental and social problems do not exsist. There would be no poverty or other problems. It would be a great opportunity to start the life from the very beginning.
Space exploration also means that the science is good developed. This factor is very important, because it shows that we are not just human beings, but the people, who can think and develope.
Finally, space exploration is highly important and it is neccessary to spend money on developing it.",60,2,2

By knowing the history, I absolutely agree with the statement that the art should be out of any political or ethetical broadens.
Today in all civil world books, films, singles aren’t restricted by the politicians. For example, there are some singers in Russia who aren’t afraid to speak about the injustice of the Russian law. From the other hand, the incident of Pussy Riot became known to the whole world. In the human’s history the development of art reached the peak during some historical events. The famous writer of the Golden Age of russian poetry Pushkin was a dekabrist, for example. In this way I consider that sometimes the restrictions develop the Art, make it more innovative. When some people do not like the situation in their country, they always speak about it in their songs, films, books, pictures and etc.
But the government is a great power, and it is necessary to remember about it. And sometimes the influence of the government can be so distructive that the art would be almost killed. 
During the repressions of Stalin not very many artists were brave enough about the things which had happened in the country. So the art was innatural; it was a lie for looking like good and right soviet man. In the 60s, after the death of Stalin, all these things that had not been spoken about began to appear with enormous intense. In this period the type of artists named abstagonists appeared at the stage. But their pictures weren’t understood by the government, so the restrictions began again. It was not in their power to strike with this great force, some of artists went abroad, other stayed to their sorrow.
The art will always alive, but in some situations the restrictions can make it poor, can make the people suffer.

There is an opinion that people who download these copies should be punished. I agree with this point of view. These essay will bring arguments for this.
The worth of such copies is low, so people try to get inspiration from a bad product. For example, once I downloaded film “Pirates of Caribbean” and couldn’t watch it more than two minutes because of strange sounds broken graphics and problems with downloading, so I decided to go to the cinema and pay for good time.
It is inhabitant for people, particularly russians, to pay for every kind of information and ability to find free film or music, or software just makes this problem harder to solve it. Because of this, information lose its unique value for customers. For example, Daniel Roshar got a few sells of product “WinPar” that was invented by him, meanwhile millions of people have it for free.
The third argument is ability to get harmful software while pirate files download. “Virus”-program can break down your “Windows” at all, or delete files from your computer. And such situation is a real danger, because the biggest amount of dangerous software is spreaded by this way.
To conclude, internet becomes bad place with such files and people who download these files should be punished. In a real life, only some people will become hitten, because the biggest part of citizens is going to avoid this and start to buy legal copies from official sites and such resources like “appstore”. Everyone will get profit except some pirates resources and virus-programmists, but we shouldn’t think about their losses.

The first thing that needs to be said is that people will continue to use pirate copies with current legislation. There are no rules for them. They know that they cannot be punished. A good illustration for this is a behaviour of a child. He will sceam and play loudly without any punishment from his mother.

Another argument in suppor of this is the good users of the content. There are somepeople who pay money for music and films. For example, someone will start to download these illegal files because everybody do it.

Last but not least, we also should say about unemployment. Producers of films and music cannot get money.They become to dismiss people. It leads to a lot of problems. For instance, there will be walkouts and protest.

We can notice the reduction of he range of good content for the maintaining of the production.

To draw a conclusion I would like to say that we should punish people, who do not want to buy and prefer pirate content.

Whilst some people argue that being caugh with using doping means exclusion from the sport field forever, other more loyal group reckon that 2 years of ban would be enough. Both views will be discussed in this essay.
Firstly, it must be tacken into account that we are talking about unfair crime. For everyone in sport industry their results are a kind of sence of their lives. So why should someone do their best, working really hard suffer of unfairness? Whilst those, who are using doping, are more working in chemistry field, than in sport. Though this perspective it is more satisfective to ban sportsmen, using illegal drugs, till the end if their lives.
Nevertheless, who is sinsless? Everyone is making mistakes throug a long life period. It doesn't mean that after one mistake a man must be excluded from a society. Moreover, when we are talking about sport, we should not put a ban forever, because it is about human nature to use all the methods to achieve the goal. From this perspective, we can agree that banning for 2 years is enough for a sportsman to analyse mistakes and become more successful in fair sports.
From my own perspective, professional sport is about being superhuman. All the results, shown on Olympic games, seems fantastic. That is why, it is incredibly unfair and cruel to use any doping, while someone is killing himself on trainings. Ban is a good way but not perfect. It seems to me that, firstly, we shouldn not prevent people from sport forever after one mistake, but using doping twise must lead to forever ban.
Secondly, I suppose it would be fair to discharge some points from a country, whose sportsman is using doping. In this way, it would become more fair and other sportsmen won't rist in using illegal drugs.
To sum up, I would like to say that although ban is a good way of punishment, it must not be a forever one after one mistake. Moreover impose punishment like discharging points on all country would work more efficiently. Everyone in a country commant should be responsible for this crime.

This essay agrees with this view. Firstly, this essay will discuss the examples of problems which individuals may get, and secondly, this essay will look at possible solutions to these problems. 

To begin with, modern technologies help people solve different problems with less effort. It is harmful to their health because they have less reasons to get up from their beds and do something. The widespread of the Internet causes a problem when people do not want to get out their houses and meet other people or just do some sports – they prefer to sit on the couch with ordered food and chat through the Internet. This leads to less activity in the life and big opportunity to be overweight because of it. The small problem of a few kilos to loose can turn into obesity. 

This problem has different solutions. Firstly, individuals can use less modern technologies to connect with each other – this will not only reduce the possibility to be overweighed because of increase of activity in their life, but also there will be a development in social interactions. Moreover, another solution depends on modernization people should invent more technologies which will help people stay fir, for example, playing tennis with a Tv with help of modern technologies imitates the real game and this trains muscles and helps to avoid obesity. 

In conclusion, there are several health problems caused by the extension of modern technologies. However, these problems can be solved in the nearest future.

Nobody wants to waste 10 or 15 years in prison and it prevent people from illegal activity. In this way the method is usefull. But there are some problems. So, it is not a secret that if you get a prison sentence you can not become a normal human in society. There are many different problems with job finding and others. Countries with alternative ways of reducing crime have no such problems. Moreover, people can do something interesting or profitable in prison in Europe, for example.

Alternative methods can reduce not only crime cases, but improve relationships between people in all.

One of the possible solutions is to make more sports facilities. However, other consider that it will not help to solve this problem and there will be other methods for improving public health.
On the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities is a good way for making peoples health better. Boys and girls could visit different sports sections and play in their favourite games. The time spent on watching TV and sitting in front of the computers will definitely decrease. For example, when my brother began to visit the football section, he had not got a time for chatting and playing computer games. Moreover, he became stronger.
On the other hand, not all people have got enough money for viviting sports clubs. For instance, if the government and businessmen open more fitness clubs, there will not be much more women visiting its, because abonements are rather expensive. Furthermore, old people can not visit sport sections because of their health.
Hence, there will another methods for improving public health. I consider that the government should think about making more medical services. Increasing the number of competent doctors is another way for solving this problem. Besides, all medical tablets should be available for people.
From my point of view, increasing the number of sports facilities is not enough foo improving health. Competent doctors, available tablets and good medical services are required.

However, this leads to the lost of huge amounts of money by musicians and film producers. So should modern pirates be punished? In this essey I will explain why it should be so.
First of all, due to losing money from illegal pirate copies some film producers do not have any chances to continue film production. That is why many good film will not appear in the cinemas. Or it can take a lot of time for film producers to find some sponsorships. Anyway, it also may be a problem if producer’s name is not worldwide knowen. I think that to solute such problem it is nesseccary for government to help film producers to decrease the cost of cinema tickets and DVD discs. It will lead to pirate copies reduction. If it is impossible, pirates must be punished with an expensive fee.
Another problem made by illegal copies is that some video clips appear on the Internet before it’s official relise. This happened with a Eurovision compitetor several years ago. So two weeks before the concert lot of people heard his song. I hope that government will find ways to stop such pirates behavior. 
Finally, unpunished copying and sharing music and film on the Internet show to young generation that it is normal. So I believe that if this situation does not stop now, in future people will have much more problems with illegal copies.

I think that it happens too often. It is breeding ground for the concern about it because young generation is our future. And if our future world will be full of jerks and criminals, what should we do to protect us and our children?
Firstly, we should understand the reasons of this problem. As far as I know, children without school education tend to commit crimes. Because they have a lot of free time without doing anything, they have no social skills which are provided by school and they are used to reach their goals by violence and crime. Another important reason of it is that parents didn’t pay enough attention to their children. For example, they are spending all time at work. So, children become too independent from parents and they can easily find a bad behaviour role mode. I mean that they can watch TV and think that villians or killers are good and cool persons. But it is not the most tragic reason of it. When your parents are cruel and violent persons with alhogol or drug addiction, it is really difficult to become a good man because your are living in the world full of dark and murky people. That is why young people comitt crimes. They have never seen the normal life or another way to realise yourself.
There are only few reasons of this problem below. But I think that it is enough to launch discussion about it. So, what should parents and teachers do to find the solution of this problem? Firstly, parents should pay more attention to their children. Of course, someone says that it is easily only when you talking about it. Yes, it is obvious but parents are the most important people for their children. So, you should stop drinking a lot, spend holidays with your son or dauther and try to be a good example for him. Schools make equal level of infuance on our children. So, teachers should make more affords to do education process more interesting and useful for young people. They should convince students that education is the greatest way in their life to realise yourself without evil. Because education is not only about math or physics, it is also about our life, tolerance and kindness.
In conclusion, I think that this problem is wide spread in our world. And we have no rights to neglect it anymore. Because it means that we are not thinking about our future. But it is not true. So, love your childrents and study harder!

In my point of view people that are against space programs are right in some aspects but i disagree with them in their main argument -- ""space exploration is a waste of money"".
First point for space exploration -- it's going to be very crucial for our society in some centuries or even earlier. Space programs are the main vector of development for humanity, because the possibilites are truly unlimited. Noone knows what space hides from us so we need to invest (not waste) our money in space development. The second concept of mine is about the difficulties of resolving society problems with just money. When you will remove all space exploration programs, that money cannot just go and remove all problems, conflicts and so on. They actually will just disappear in government and all issues will remain untouched. The third thing that i should note about space -- it's about army too. Space is a great place of developing some brand new ways of defeating the enemy or defending from attacks. For example, there are some serious defense from rockets systems that are located in space. And noone will remove them, until some kind of convention against it will come out. My only point against space exploration is the fact of governments of different countries are corrupt, and money that would go in normal government for space development will be taken by someone. But that won't happen in private projects like Space-X.
In the end I want to state that space exploring is a good investement in our future, but we should never forget about people and our planet Earth. Actually some projects of space exploration are definitly waste, but most of them are very useful.",65,2,5

This is not the case for Rio de Janeiro, where temperatures are a lot more stable throughout, with the minimum being around +17*C in the summer to the maximum of +29-30*C in the winter.

Many people are triing to solve that, and to make proper decisions there is a need to work out the key factors causing the behaviour change.

As far as I’m concerned, one of the main reasons of bad behaviour is a nurture. Everyone faces different problems and meets different people while getting older. These difficult situations and acquaintances influence a person greatly both in positive and negative ways depending on the situation.

One of the important causes is also the character of a person. During the process of growing everyone tries to attract  attention and become respected somehow. That is why some people behave badly thinking such a way will help him to look older or cleverer even though this is not always work.

Personally, I also believe that some teachers might be the cause of the bad behaviour of students. Those teachers who have strong character, who are strict and loyal at the same time will never face negative attitude from their students. 

What can be done to solve the problem of worsening behaviour among students? First of all, I believe it is important to talk with students who behave in a bad way. Dialogue has always been among the best means of solving problems. More than that, while talking people will know each other better and more likely to understand each other.

Ultimately, I suppose that bad behaviour will also survive in the society. As the school is very important stage of getting future experience it will always face such a problem. I believe that it have to be solved with every student privately, and primarily in a form of the dialogue.

There are various policies that regulates crime level. Most popular way of reducing crime is to give longer prison sentences which is believed to be a harsh method.  In contrast to radical government policy there are several alternatives. First of all longer prison sentences should fear potential frauds from commiting a crime, but statistics in American states such as Texas shows that it has no effect on current situation state. Moreover, for some people living in prison is a benefit, for example, the number of unemployed persons is rising due to qualification level. That is why such strict methods will achieve nothing in particular. From the other hand, government is able to regulate crime level by changing people’s way of thinking and providing more job and education opportunities for citizens. Because main reason for commiting a crime is lack of satisfaction from your current live condition. The other chance to lower the crime state is to slow criminals how to live “properly”. A perfect example is relation programmes aimed on employing. There are a lot of people commited a crime in inappropriate psychological education. For such person longevity of prison sentence is useless, because from this point of view he is unconscious. To sum up all reasons against such way of reducing crime level, each of criminals should be treated by individual method based on personal characteristics and history feedback. This policy will allow to lower the risk of commiting a crime among all age groups in addition such way is able to influence fundamental bases of society which will lead infants and adult away from this spoilt path.

This is undoubtedly that modern technology has a bad influence on human health. For example, computer lights damage for eyes. Moreover, a lot of people spend with TV a lot of time. It can be a reason for hypodinamia. 
Some experts emphasized that microwave is a very bad way to cook the meal because of dangerous waves that caused serious problem with health, for example, cancer. One of the most striking features of this problem that a lot of people aware the fact that modern technology are known to be dangerous for their health, but continue to use it in the daily routine and very often.

For example, to have a one TV in the house instead of a four, do not spent a lot of time with computer games and to sit in the front of TV in the whole day. From these facts, one may conclude that human demand on new technology is very high, but for healthy living it is needed to reduce the influence of modern techology by declined this percentage in consumption.

One kind of such theft is the pirate copying of music and films. There are heated debates on whether it is a real crime and what punishment should the culpable face.
Personally, I believe that illegal copying and sharing of works of any form of contemporary art should not be tolerated. Producers, musicians, directors and many other professionals invest in their projects and work hard in order to release them. So, copying the materials illegally robs people of their legitimate money which they could have gained if a pirate has not opened an access.
However, I disagree that every person accused of illegal sharing deserves punishement. Those who share the works of the deceased people do not rob the artists themselves of their money. So, it essentially means that because of pirate copying people prevent money from getting in those who played no part in creating the music or the film. Thus, the artist’s work becomes the property of every member of the society. In my opinion, this is the way the system should work.
To conclude, I would like to stress that in order to find an efficient way solve the problem people should shift from punishing those who share the protected materials to thoroughly explaining those who download them why they should stop doing that. Only this scheme will eventually bring results because where there is demand there is supply.

My position is that it is normal to download some films or music; which are rare, but in fact, nowadays almost nobody buy discs, because they are litle ‘acient goods’. It is much more convinient to have movies and music in your phone or in computer memory.

On the one hand we understand that art provides lose money when people downloading and sharing music or films instead of going to the cinema. That is an issue in the movie and music industry, but in real life many of people just have not an opportunity to visit a cinema so often or buy huge amount of music. In comparison with ordinary people musicians and film directors earn much money from concerts and film distributors. 

To conclude my thoughts I guess that buying the original version of movies and music must be decided individually by ourselves. Someone need better quality of a sound and a picture so that he or she could buy the originals, but who just need a first-hand acquaintance with smth can get it illegally and I suppose that it shouldn’t be punished.

I totally disagree with this idea. Firstly, is travelling by plane really unnecessary? I guess no! Air travel is the most convienient, and the fastest way to go somewhere. Secondly, there are great number of laws, and creating new ones will take much time and money. But still, I agree, that government have to make some measures to help our atmosphere stop suffering from air pollution and global warming.

It is agreed that this tendence cause a big negative impact on the less developed countries. This essay will discuss, firstly, globalization processes that are incommon all over the world. Secondly, how the international organisations and companies break the law using underaged as the main source for the daytime and nighttime work. As it could be seen many international companies are trying to involve in local economics to prevent country for further development. Different globalization processes which are the part of worlwide organisations way to gain influence cause many disadvantages for local people. For instance, in Indonesia many international companies as Nike or Adidas build their fabrics for the low-paid workplaces, because in developed countries the same work would cost a company much more money. Only about two or three dollars are paid people who are mostly underaged per week. The conditions in which locals are surviving are terrible: long working day, a little space between the wworkers and etc. As it was mentioned above the many workers in local fabrics of international companies are underaged. Unfortunately, it is a well-known labor politics in Asia where children are working since they are five. All types of labor are common among the teenagers as seewer or driver, for example. Even nowadays nothing can prevent such horrible worldwide tendence which is surely connected to even more sufficient issues as rasicm or tolerance loss. To instance, it is commonly known that North America is often using Mexico as a source of getting cheap labor for the food or clothing industries. Overall, it can be stated that the international companies business development in the poorest countries raise enormous amount of different types of problems, as social, economical and environmental.  ",65,2,2

Allegedly, the number of crimes committed by young people has increased and, therefore, something has to be done to stop this tendency. In this essay I will discuss the problem and try to come up with certain solutions.

Firstly, the reason for young people committing crimes might lie in their mental health. One of the urgent problems at schools in the twenty first century is bullying. Many youngsters become victims of bullies, they suffer from constant jokes and sometimes can even get beaten up. As a consequence, they want to express their anger which may come out in a form of a crime. An example for this can be found in multiple records of how pupils came to schools and shot their classmates. The possible solution may include bringing up this issue in schools and create some kind of movement against bullying. This might make bullying seem unappealing and, therefore, less popular. As a result, the number of crimes triggered by this facet will decline.
Secondly, many young people fail to get along with their parents and sometimes can do things just to make them mad, or because of constant fights. This happens due to the fact that family is quite important in the life of every human, so when you feel you are not loved and understood, you want to substitute it somehow. The point is that many youngsters commit crimes in order to get attention from their parents or to prove them something. So, the best solution one can think of here would be creating a warm atmosphere at home where teenagers could feel loved and supported. Parents should try to understand the problems of being a teenager and try to help their children go through this period reducing the number of stressfull situations as often as possible.

To sum up, many crimes young people commit stem from problems they have in school and family which are the most significant institutions in the life of a teenager. That is why both teachers and parents should be aware of the hurdles youngsters are facing and try to help them in all the possible ways.",75,2,0

The metals transportation is in more than three times bigger on the rails, than in the road. The food products shares the figures opposite situation, and the food share is just a third part of road’s share. Manufactured goods take quite simmilar part in both types o transportation, having 25% on the rail and 28% on the road.

To this point it is believed that for persons, who made these things, artists, freedom is needed to express their creation. However, some people believe that government restrictions plays crucial role and can improve our life. In all areas of art freedom to express own ideas is needed. For example, we can consider music spere. All composers or music players make some awesome works. There they usually express their own feelings, own attitude by composing these songs or works. If they are restricted by government, they won't be able to make these marvellous creations truly from their heart. It is like to be a wild animal behind the bars, in the cage near to their natural home. However, it is also believed that it is a big mistake to give freedom to artists to express their own thoughts. Many of these ideas can be really harmful for government. For instance, one statement can lead to a disagreement between different peoples which can cause a conflict and in bad case will lead to a revolution. In 20th centure Soviet Union have the policy to restrict the artists: the ones, who allow themselves to make some contraversial works were prisoned in order to make the nation more ""clean"". Without creation our life will be dark and not interesting. Artists help us to admire the beauty not only of the art, but of the whole world.

However, it is considered as the most polluting type of transport which can affect environment seriously, even it may increase the global warming.
On the one hand, air travel is fast and this is the major advantage of this type of transport. It is a great opportunity to reach another end of a country or the world for the shortest time, especially if if necesarry. For example, if some disaster happens and there are a lot of people who are need help.
On the other hand, air travelling is not the safest, because every week news are told us about some catastrophe. It is also not the cheapest way of travelling and not every person can afford it. Moreover, planes have negative effect on the environment, producing a lot of gases which waste not only air, but also ground and water. These gases increase the temperatures all around the world, and this causes the global warming, which can create so much natural disasters.
I believe that air travelling is worth remaining in our life despite all disadvantages, but only for very important things. I think governments have to reduce or introduce taxes for privat flights, different business flights and travelling by plane for leisure.

According to that fact, two points of view appeard: one people believe that it is right to ban such athletes from competing for a limited period, while others insist on banning them for the rest of their lives. Both views are popular nowadays, but who is right?
First of all, we should research how the use of illegal drugs affects human organism. People, who stand for permanent ban often claim that drugs cause changes in human health, that cannot be reversed. So even those sportsmen, who used to do drugs but then stopped have a serious benefits and can show better results than those who never even tried illegal drugs. According to that, it is undebatable, that we should ban those people, but if it is not right, we don't have a clear reason to disqualify them for the rest of their lifes.
Never the less, it is obvious than people who use illegal drugs to win controdict the idea of competitive sport itself, where everyone is eiqual and training an will age the most important things to succeed. I do not think, that we should allow people, who once betrayed the idea of sport, to take part in competition. On the other hand, just as any criminal can change and be the normal member of society, sportsmen who were cought on doing drugs should be given a chanse to change their attitude to sport.
And the last, but not the least is the fact, that not everyone who uses illegal drugs even know about it. There are some cases, when sportsmen were treated with drugs by their trainers or even doctors without even understending it. So, according to this, we can't know if someone used drugs by his will or not, so punishment should not be permanent.

	It is clear that in a world many creative people with their own opinions and ideas in different countries government restrict their creative.
	I believe that government do not should restrict creative people like artists, film directors and musicians in their creative. In a result of what they do we get that what help us to improve yourself. We go to the art gallerys and music conserts and enjoy it. We leave in freedom country and we can get everithing for make our live better. If government will restrict our life it will be look like Germany in 1941.
	Bu if creative people get very big freedom they are begin make dirty art and do not respect history. For example different modern films about second warld war. So I think that government do not should restrict creative people hard but should watching and easy control them/
	Overall, in the world meny talanted people who want to make something wonderful for society and goverment should help them realise yourself.

Some people may argue such a system can be beneficial for the society, while others believe it may be even harmful. I suppose this issue requieres more careful consideration.

On the one hand, if a ""Guaranteed basic income"" system is organised, it will have certain advantages. Firstly, every person will be prevented from absolute poverty, as they will receive minimal income on a monthly basis.For instance, they can spend this money to buy products or to pay for rent. Secondly, such an idea will be beneficial for home-staying mothers, especially for those who are the only breadwinners in the family, because they sometimes struggle to find a job. Furthermore, this system is to help elderly people and teenagers to become more independent from other members of their family.

On the other hand, when people receive money regardless of the situation, they may face several problems. First of all, the government will need to increase taxes to compensate the money which were spent from the budget. Moreover, people might feel deprived of the impulse to find a job or a better job, as they will be financially secure. Nevertheless,the desire to improve the quality of life usually maintaines the same level in any society.

To conclude, although implemention of this system may have several drawbacks, it is likely to provide citezens with a necessary sum of money, which sometimes can save their lives and even make them better. Therefore, I suppose advantages of this system will outweigh the drawbacks.",70,2,2

On the first there are results of quantity of people who study for career or for interest. In the group of «under 26» approximately 80 per cent interest. With the age results change. As for people who study for career results drop slightly.  For example : in the group from 26 to 29 years old it is around 70 percent, for the 30 – 39 years old group result’s are lower, it is less than 60 per cent, as for the 40 – 49 years old group results showed that they study as well for career as for interest. The bouth results have 40 per cent. Results for people who study for interest differ. The highest number of people who study, for interest are from the group «over 49», it is 70 per cent. The lowest result showed people from the group «under 26», it is 10 per cent. 
The second graph shows the amount of support that students received from employers.  We can see that the highest results were showed by the group of «under 26», it is approximately 65 per cent. The lowest results are around 35 per cent by 30 – 39 years old group. 
To summurise this two graphs, we can say that results between ages are different. People under 26 are studing for career actually and more than 60 per cent of them received the amount from employers. People from 30 to 39 are not good for employers, but more than 80 percent of them are studying for career.

In my opinion, there are indeed quite a range of specific health problems that spring from our sometimes malformed modern lifestyle. As such, we suffer from heart diseases a lot more than our ancestors because of increased level of everyday stress and lack of physical activities; we are at risk of various kinds of cancer due to bad ecological conditions: obesity becomes widespread, since our nutrition culture is far from healthy: and so on.

Despite what has been said, there are ways to reduce, if not get rid of, such problems. We need to remember that not the technologies themselves are to blame, but rather our own ignorance and laziness. Modern city life is indeed stressful, however, advanced urban planning technologies allow us to reduce noise levels, traffic jams, and improve air condition. Industry does cause significant damage to the environment, but it is with more advanced technology that we create environmental-friendly production processes and use clean energy sources. In the end, without technological progress there would have been no modern medicine, which allowed developed countries to increase mean lifespawn more than twofold since XIX century.

As our society is developing alongside with technologies we use, it becomes more obvious that the progress is not to be feared. Each new generation becomes more educated than its precessors, and all of those bizarre myths, such as that microvave radiation leads to cancer or LD-monitors are especially bad for our sight, go away. I personally believe that further technological advance is the only way for humanity to overcome the global problems the world is facing nowadays, even if some of them originated from use of less complicated technology.

It is very convenient there to check the latest news, just by choosing several media resources which you like most, sorting the news, saving and discussing them with friends.

To add to this, the products (aluminium), wich is used to make plains, is make influence on the pollution too, in the process of building the air transport.  In conclusion, I would like to say, that I clearly understand the opinion of such people, who want to save the Earth, but in the 21st centure we cannot imagen our life wihout travelling, it means that we cannot live without plains, because it would make influence on all spectors of life, on work, on privat life. But the main looses will be in the economics of developing and developed countries.

At the age of 16-24 years old it is a significant difference between 282,1 min that spent men and 114,1 min that spent women. After this age, the difference is getting lower till the age of 55-64 when women were more active and spent 2,7 min more doing sport than men. Next ages men spent more time than women. However, the difference was not so large. Secondly, an average time spent doing sport and exercises was falling down dramatically from 282,1 min to 29,2 of men and from 114,1 to 10 by women.

Let us discuss pluses and mineses about it and what should government to do.
The biggest advantage here is freedom of conscisness. 	If humans with the wide imagination can express their own ideas how they want, their brain does not afraid that somebody forbids him or her to do it. They can imagine a lot of unusuall things and it can be useful for the world. This is the way how great works, like “Monoliza” or anything else was born. 
However, there are some people who think that creative celebrities exaggerate a lot of things and some of them are crazy. They reckon that the government ought to ban them. That humans confident that the creative artists have their own groups there they can provide theirs ideas and points of view in the narrow circle. If somebody new is interested in it, he or she can come to this group and learn it.
In my opinion, creative people should speak about their music, films, pictures and about other works, but in a careful form. If somebody is interested in it he or she will come to a concert, cinema, exhibition and so on.
To sum up, I think that advantages about expressing their ideas are greater than disadvantages. If somebody do not want to see it he or she will not. This is the personal choice of everybody.

However, it is useful to let them do freely without any concern of the government.
	We are living in liberty and democracy, so not only artists but also everyone has it’s truly rights to do what they want. Creative artists, in particular, can feel  respected when they have freedom to show their ideas do the world. They may feel people believe in them and always wait to see their new ideas such as words, pictures, music or films. In addition, this feeling can give them motivation which makes them create more wonderful productions.
	Nevertheless, it will be too risk for the government to have no restrictions on what artists do. Some violent and erotic paintings may be drawn everywhere in the streets like walls, park benches and even on the schools. It can be worse. For example, an artist goes to a museum, and he suddenly has a new idea about his new picture. He may draw his thoughts on some cultural heritages. He ignores the rules of the museum because he is free to express his idea in any way. The worst thing is that children can be affected badly by some abstract paintings which the are not old enough to understand.
	In conclusion we need to recognize that artists are creative-personality and they need to get it or the can’t work.

Nowadays air pollution and global warmimg, which can be named expected results of regular air travel, appear to be widely discussed by both citizens and governments. Whether the amount of air travel should be reduced by legal measures is a controversial question worth discussing.
Some people claim that introducing laws which decrease the amount of trips made by air transport means is a proof of overreacting and not being able to suggest an actual solution of this issue, which is an opinion I share. To begin with, while air travel does contribute to air pollution and global warming, it is not the main souce of the issues and there are other spheres to be noticed by concerned people. Moreover, with the introduction of such laws getting to another place by air would turn out to be much more difficult and take more time and money, which can have bad consequences when an immediate need to travel appears. In addition, extreme contorl of the air travel sphere might result badly in terms of jobs and burocraty.
However, there are people who believe that providing laws to contorl and specifically reduce air travel regularity is absolutely necessary. Firstly, it is the governments' responsibility to step up when a world-wide issue has reached a crucial condition. Secondly, it is imeprative that some actions in the ecology sphare are taken and a possible decrease in the amount of air travel is a practical first step in this course. Thirdly, this idea might increase people's awareness of the issua and make them consider more advantages and disadvantages for ecology when making a decision to travel by air.
In conclusion, the possibility of introducing such laws seems to be drawing people's attention for a number of reasons; with heated discussions of the issue such measure would be not advised until more detailed agreements are reached. Hopefully, in the future a solution will appear that will not include making unnecessary barriers for people willing and/or in need to travel by air.",70,2,0

First position means, that goverment and business should invest more money in sport, build new sport centers in cities, develope different competitions in each kind of sport. For their meaning; it would increase people interest in sports, give them opportunities to do sport. All this points should increase in general health of population. This position can be true, because sport really improve personal health and also save people from smoking, drinking and using drugs.
But on the other hand increasing of number of sport facilities may do not improve people's health. If sport sections will cost too much, usual people could not join them. Also, sport facilities can be use for sport shows by businesmen. It is good point, but really it will not increase people health. Another point for this position, that sport is not main part of health. Money, which also should be invested in medcine, health care, but not only in sport.
To conclude, building of sport facilities is a good term for populating sport. But it is not the only part of health programe. The goverment should only increase the level of health care, struggle with bad habbits of population and so on. If to do this all together, people health will be increased after some period of time.

Noticeably that many of company holders and presidents decide to change their business`s homeland and move it to less developed countries, where they attract local workers and provide them with salary. I personally see only benefits from this position for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is not a secret that so-called countries of the First World can help poorer ones become economically stronger and more developed by learning their popularity and society how to make a living. Having a business is not an exeption. People start working there, watching the process, solving problems and deals. Men and women can see that they can live in other conditions, have a good work-place with an appropriate amount of money provided. In the result, the common attitude towards a lifestyle changes or turns to another side, showing opening horizins and opportinities. Secondly, not only workers, but also the employees gain profits by spending less money on the whole production, because in the developing countries prices for work are far less than in they motherland. In that case company use its income also to maintain some other things that are too important as worker`s salaries.  In addition, it is considered to believe that several developing countries are more good at some certain spheres like India in clothing production. That means that companies push their limits to improve its own skills how to make a product. Nowadays, thit kind of cooperation leads to effective and impressive results. In couclusion, it can be said that the decision depends on the company`s keeper only. Some presidents see benefits in this path, other are less positive, but it is highly necessary to give poorer countries a chance to grow up and aspire their potentional. ",55,2,4

First of all, everybody who download something in the Internet should be punished, if he done it without acception or paying. We should stay at the position that every work shoud be doing for price or any inmaterial goods, like glory, respect or something like that. In another way the working is not payed.

So, in Yemen almost half part of population is youngsters and only 3,6% is 60 and over aged people. At the same time, in 2000 year, in Italy the most part of population consists of citizens from the 15-59 years age bracket. By the 2050 year the age group from Italy containing 0-14 years citizens will remain stable compared with the same group in Yemen: it will decrease to 37,0%. Interestingly, in Italy by 2050 year the age bracket containing citizens aged 60 and over will be almost two times larger than in 2000 year. In Yemen this group will remain stable. What is more, the amount of youngsters in Yemen will go down and will be only 37,0%.

Especially, there are more and more young people, who are involved in different crimes. It can be due to vary reasons.
From my point of view, it can be caused by living in poverty and in bad housing conditions, young people start to steal a little bit from shops and then do it more and more often, because they want to eat or buy something that they need, but do not much money to buy it themselves. Another reason can be misunderstanding of the consequences, they are young and have no idea about jail at all, for example. They commit crimes sometimes just for fun with their friends and do not think about the consequents.
I strongly believe that parents and teachers can warn young people from those crimes, if they start it in childhood in right way. Parents should tell their children why it is bad and what they must not do. It can be not in a serious way, but it should be in every family. Parents should look for their children and take care of them every minute, child should feel it. In teacher’s turn they should discuss problems of crimes during their studies, children should be ready for life without any participation in crime. There are a variety of legitimate methods of earning money.
In conclusion I would like to say that currently young people’s crimes is very serious problem and we should with all the forces try to solve this problem.",65,2,3

Manufactured goods have almost equal percentage 25% and 28% by rail and by road. Certainly, itis preferred to use railway to move machinery, so the share of it in the first chart is 10% higher than in the second one. It is also more convenient to transport food by roads, that is why 30 percent of raod transportation is food products while it is only 11 percent in ""rail"" chart.

I am disagree with them for some reasons and this essay will explain why.
Air travels are necessary part of global communication. They are the main reason of rapid globalization of the word. Reducing the amount of air travel will slow down the process of development. For example, if we compare development of world trade during USSR times. Then most flights were restricted with a period of modern Russia we will see that global trade and global travel of people are making both countries economics better.
It is also obvious that in a closest future there will be methods to reduce waste from planes. It will make flights completely safe for the environment. There are a lot of concepts of planes that are eforking on biofuel. As an example, Lochhead Martin presents a new engine that will decrease the amount of toxic traces. On the nearest future this project will be ready.
To sum up, there are no serious reasons for reducing flights. Ecological problems will only exist in short-term period and won't affect the global processes on Earth. In long-term period we will get ecologically clean planes that will make flights completely safe for the environment.

This quastion have positive and negative points, so it is hard to say that this idea is right or wrong. But I will analyse two sides of this quastion. At first, economic of countries, which export the food, very influenced by other countries, which import the food. And if one country stop to import some goods from exporter country, then economic of this country will decrease. But it is may not influence on importer country. I think this solution may be positive for economic situation of this country.

But this idea has other side. I think that it is possible to say about two nessesary negative aspects of this solution. One of this aspects is problems of country, when it can’t produce many food, that their own population eats. It can be involved with climat or other reason. So, importing the food is the one possible solution for this countries. Other negative aspect is possible influencing on friendship between two countries. And consiguanters will be negative. It is also big problem, becouse it will can involve to importing country in the future. But I sure that this negative outcome can be not nessesary, if importer stop import during some time.

What should the punishment look like: shold the sportsmen be banned from participation for a specific amount of time or even forgood?
To begin with, some sportsmen use drugs for medical purposes such as meldonium in Sharapova's case, so the athletes could use it to prevent professional illnesses and that would be fair to expell them from competition just for a limited amount of time. Besides, they get high scores and such medical prescriptions will serve its best, and the experts are aware of the health issues.
On the other hand, sports is meant only for healthy, strong and professional people, and there is no place for illegal drugs at such competitions like Olympic Games. As the problem of using drugs is spreading, people believe that banning sportsmen for the rest of their life is the best option.
In addition, there were a plenty of researches proving that using drugs hurts the athelets' health ten-fold times more. Unfortunately, sometimes it is almost impossible to find out if the athelet was on drugs as the government hides the results of the medical expertize.
In my opinion, the athelets who use drugs should be banned from competition forgood as they break the law and act unfair making ""clean"" sportsmen suffer. The main reason for such descision is to make law valuable, so there is no second chances for such cheaters.
In conclusion, with banning athelets who break the law should be banned. That will make the competition fair.

It is necessary to provide the students of both sexes with an equal amount of places on each faculty, or can some certain gender traits have an impact on that proportion?

In my opinion it is important that the universities provide both male and female students with an equal access to the exams and faculty places. It is clear that nowadays women have become more confident and are not afraid to participate in the competitions with their male counterparts. Right after the 19th century feminist movement women acquired many rights firstly reserved specifically for men, including the right to study. If a woman can study in the chosen field she can make a good career for herself applying her knowledge appropriately.

Also the division of subjects on «male» and «female» ones is quite ridiculous as it doesn’t consider the talents of each given individual. If a man wants to be a poet or a designer or a teacher it doesn’t that he will grow to be less masculine in the same fashion as the woman who chooses to study engineering or mathematics doesn’t lose her femininity. Everyone should be able to follow their dream and the faculty choice is the first step towards its relation.

On the whole I argue that all the universities should decide weather to allow or not each given student to study in the certain subject judging not by their gender but by their knowledge and eagerness.

Many people involved in music or films production claim that they lose very big amount of money because of the pirating. However, there is another group of people, which believes that different tupes of art should be free for people, as they belong to all people in the world. Both groups of people have their own argument, and it would be interesting to know them and decide whether or not pirating is a bad thing.
The first group of people which support the “anti-pirating” point of view claim that pirating damages the rign of pirate property which is one of the fundamental right of all humen. “Every intellectual properties belong to one who produces them” – they said. Also, They usually say that pirating damges incomes of musicians and filmmakers, so they worry others about the situation that the worldwide music and film industry becomes less productive and more dependent of government (which affects the quality of all types of art).
The second group of people which support pirating usually refers to the idea of “free intelectual belongings”. They proclaim that only private (not intellectual) properties can exist. Every mental idea produced by anybody belongs to everybody. For example, famous musician Phillipe Kirkorov has once said that he is ready to spread his music among people for free as real arts is more important than “real” money. It’s very expensive performance to my point of view.
In conclusion I would like to summarize all argument and give my point of view. I definitely agree with the second group of people as I think pirating has small influence on in comes of musicians and film makers. Moreover, I suppose that such ideological idea of “anti-pirating” promots social inequality and harm the spirit of collectivism. So, in order to summarize previous arguements, I suppose that arguements from the first group are irrelevant. So, the second group is definitely right.

But pollutions are essential part of modern life too. This essay will look at all advanteges and gisadvatges of planes.
It is commoned believe that airplanes are one of the less dangerous transport in the world. For people today their safety is more important then air and water pollution, or such kind of global problem as warming. Transport statics gives us the information that there is a minimum risk to face with different kinds of terrorists or murderers in the plane, because all passengers must de checked.
Many people prefer planes, because it is more comfortable and faster then travel by a train or a ship. For instance, for buisnessmen plane is a good opportunity to have more then one meeting a day in different country, even if he is alone in the plane.
But on the other hand, the environmental problems are problems of all humans. If government will not decline the number of airplanes now, our children would have problem with clean air or fresh water. The number of endengerd specious would grow every year because of flobal warming. For example, the polar bears would have no place to hunt, if icebergs slide. Would exist problem with electricity and another tupes of energy.
Having consumpted both sides of the problem it can be concluded, that I personally agree with the idea that governments should introduce the low to decrease the number of air travels.

Some people argue that children are not controlled well by their parents, others tend to say that it is the government to blame for these issues. In this essay, I will outline different causes why young people commit crimes and possible solutions of how to tackle these issues.
Firstly, lots of people blame parents for not rearing their children in a proper way. Children who are not well prepared for the world's environment tend to riot and do illegal things just to prove thair uniqueness. Morever, uncontrolled children continiously play computer games with a lot of violence and if they are not aware of the possible harmfull consequences it may cause, they mirror the doing in the game to their lives and, as a result, become those who commit crime unconsiously.
Secondly, the government can be a cause. The more crimes exist, the less government use its special forces to protect people from crimes. What is more, police officers should be on duty in every part in any country. If the territory is well-obesvered, it is possible less dangerous because everything is clearly seen.
In these two cases, it is possible to provide several solutions to deal with these problems. First is to make parents oversee their children more often, which can be done by creating friendship relationship with children, at the same time not overwhelming them with the controll. Everything needs to be balanced. Second solution to the another cause can be creating extra police force and develop new ways to oversee the territory.

To conclude, I would like to say that the issue about young people who commit crimes is quite vital and needs to be studied more precisely. Each solution, whether it is providing the whole awareness of children that crimes are illegal, or whether it is about increasing the controlling of the therritory. Each solution is a long-term method, but tackling the problems about crimes should begin as quickly as possible.",65,2,2

Looking at the chart more closely, it is obvious that USA sells more books than any of the other three countries listed. On the contrary, UK makes the smallest market of all four, followed closely by China. The other thing that catches our eye is that eBooks seem to become more popular if we believe the forecast for 2018. In USA and Germany the amount of eBooks rockets and multiplies by 1.5, in China the tendency the same, eBooks increase by 50%, in UK the uprising is not so radical, but it is still evident.
To sum everything up, I can conclude that consumption of eBooks' production will increase, which will have a positive effect on markets in all four countries, especially USA.

However there are some argues about this fact. Personaly I can not agree with the statement.

Firstly, I believe that the choise of the field of the study is closely connected with nature of the person, his habits, family and other factors which makes us take disissions , it is not only our sex. Secondly, it is known that girls and boys thinks different. So why should their choises be the same? Of boys are interested in mathematics, they will choose it in their unithersities. The situation is the same with girls and humanitarian studies. In my view, universities really have a situation when more males than females want to learn some subjects. This is the reason why some faculties has not equal number of men and women. I think the try have equal-numbered maled and femaled courses is crashing down, because of this fact. Universities just can not provide this idea among students, where everybody wants to learn something interesting, not equal-numbered.

Overwise there are some factors make people think that equal number of males and females is important. The key point is that in faculty, there are, for example, 10 girls and 10 boys, educational process goes better as a result of comparison of views. Scientists also think that this way of studying is good for student’s future, because they became more tolerant and peaceful to the other sex compared with social groups where are same sex people, which are more likely to be sexists.

To sum up, I can say that having both the equal and non-equal number of males and females could bring some advantages and drawbags for communication. Although I bekieve universities should gain an interest to a subject as a key point of studying.

And it is common knowledge that people all over the world prefer watching British or American films to their local films. Should we blame governments for not giving money to local film industries?

We all know that films that are made in Britain or America are more popular than films that are made in other countries. There are several reasons why people prefer them to locally produced ones. Of course British and American films have huge financial support, not only from governmets, but also just from rich people who are intersted in them. However, first of all, these films are really well made and they have interesting plot. Secondly, British amd American films always have impressive visual effects, people like them. Thirdly, the most well known directors are from Britain and America, that is why people will like their films even if they are not so good. The reason is the perfect reputation of these directors.
Finally, Britain and America are very developed countries, people from other countries always want to follow them. And they can admire British or American lifestyle through the screen.

However, some people are sure that financial support from governments can make any local movie better. They think that all the visual effects can be made using special expensive programes.To their mind, there is no need in talent to make great movies. Money would be enough to create a masterpies.

Some people believe that the best way to reduce the crime rate is to give longer sentences to the prisoners. There are also people who suppose that we should find other solutions for this problem.  From my point of view, it is not a good idea to give long prison sentences to the people, who are guilty for breaking the law or who have committed a serious offense. To begin with, the living conditions in the prison may affect badly the individuality of people, because when a person is under the prison for a long period of time he starts to forget how to communicate and socialize with other people. Furthermore, he starts to forget how the world around him looks like, and it might become really a difficult problem to him to rehabilitate after he will be allowed to go free. Nevertheless, there are people who think that the best way to struggle against the problems connected with crime is to place people in prison for longer periods. Firstly, it might help to reeducate them. Moreover, it provides the assurance that the prisoner, who is guilty, will not commit another crime.  I do not really agree with that opinion and I am sure that there should be found alternative ways of reducing crime - community services, improving the police forces and so on.   To conclude, crime is really a serious and dangerous problem in our society. There are people who argue that prison sentences should be longer, as well as people who assume that we must find other ways of dealing with the problem of crime. I believe that our government should immediately take measures against this problem of the reduction of crime and improve the situation with all the possible methods. ",65,2,1

For example, if Russian people want to go to America they will not use a train or a bus because of a big distanation and ocean some people can say that people should travel in nearest places. Sometimes people need to use a plane because of work. It is necessary to reach a country as faster as it possible. There is no another solution of such situation people think that bisiness and leasure is not so important part of life because of it governments decide to reduce these types of traveling. In my opinion, people should travel by plane in any cases no matter bissines or something other. Nevertheless, one should consider problem from another angle. There are a lot of important factors where using of air travel is unnecessary. A plane is used when people need fast help. Foe example, it can be some medecine help for country which has sudden dangerous. In this situation people should not think about air pollution and global warming, they have to go for help immideatly. Taking everything into consideration, one can say that it is really important to protect air pollution. It is difficult to find a good solution of this problem. I do not agree with governments desision because I think that everyone who wants should use our travel.

At the same time, the disappearing of this phenomen is only the ullusion. And the question is ""What we need to change?"". Some people belive that the best way to stop crime is to make prison sentences longer. Others claim that the high purity of life can prove only the humanity method.
The fist ""camp"" confident in the right position of making punishment longer isntead of letting prisoners be a part of society. The frenetic pace of increasing crime cannot stop the small period of sentence. The world need to rethink and understand that the main way to end with dreadful crimes are making people to fright by using hard methods.
Another ""camp"" claim that all people have a chance to change. Mostly the prisoners made awfull actions due to the fact of the social problems. All people has light beginning inside the soul. The alternative ways(by using education, social works etc.) are the right choice to make our world better.
To my point of view, I understand that the fast way of progress, wich make the differences between poor and rich people are highest, wil be continuing to increase the crime. However, the right position is to change prisoner's mind instead of the time's period of his sentence.
To the end, it should be mentioned that the best idea of stopping crime is trying to give a comprehensive deveplopment of personality frome childhood. It's really important to prove the glory of life by giving an opportunity to be a part of society to every person. That's why to achive the worldwide purity we need to develope the best character traits by using immortal values of life.",55,2,0

However, there is no one strategy to improve the cituation, some people suggest that long imprisonment is the best way to prevent the crime as the punishment will distract people from commiting it. Nevertheless, it could be  helpful there is a fundamental flaw in this solution. First of all, it matches only prepared crime but not an accidental one and those people who caused death because of their low attention on the road ,for example, are sentensed to the punishment which is very strict.  Other people consider that there are more efficient measures for this problem like helping unprotected social groups of people who are at reask to become a criminal because of their poverty. Another solution is maintaining social awareness and high level of responsibility among the people, enough to call the police if the crime is commited. It is also needs to mention that effective work of justice and police are the main measures.

Music and films are the same product for sale as gadgets or food. The authors of music and film directors spend their working hours to create a new song or to shoot a new film. That is the the reason why they have all rights to make revenue and get money from their job. It is wrong to make the results of their hard work available for everybody.
Looking at the another side of this issue, the internet users are not blamed that they have the opportunity to download something for free. Many of them have low salaries and they could not afford to buy legal version or CD disk.
The government should introduce low prices for downloading music and films. So the demand of such products won’t decrease and the right owners get their reward.

To begin with, people burn with a number of characteristics. Comprising the base of our behaviour, it has crucial influence way of people’s life. For instance, if we talk about the appearience, lovely face, natural charisma and also smile allow people to be in a good relationships with others.

What is more, personaly experiences have a great influence on people’s mind. Relationships with coleags also is a bulk of job performance. Moreover people need to be in touch with family, because it is related with life satisfaction.
In conclusion. both the characteristics we are born and development over the life period and experiences have a crucial influence on our personality. They are important in a equal way.

Moreover, other part of people think that only sport but also the food, thoughts of people and their job can influence the health. The fast-moving world pressure on people, therefore they have no time to eat healthy food, vegetables and fruit. So they start to eat fast food, junk food, (for instance, french fries, coca-cola and other soft drinks, burgers etc.). It leads to different diseases and damages the health. Moreover, people can not relax, because their jobs bring them nervous things. And human beings are too busy to spent time even with their family. And, of course, they can not spent time to go to the gym. Furthermore, negative thoughts and emotions give the worst results. If people think in a positive way, they will have a good health.

For some people downloading music and films is a theft, which must be punished. 
On the one hand it is a really problem, because people always download music and films free for a long time. The film or composition was done in 1990 year, for example, but people are listening it free for latest years. Musicians and producers involve a lot of money for their compositions, so they need to make money again by selling films or music disks in special shops. The main role plays own rights and rights of property. Musician or producer makes imaghines. some interesting film or beautiful music, so it is his mind and he must be given money. And people who take it from author without permission really make theft.
On the other hand musicians and producers make money from concerts and seeing films in the cinema, so they have enough money for pleasent and comfortable surviving. The music and films were free in the internet for a long time, so now people really cannot imagine life without it. Seeing films and listening music is a good chance to improve your shills or mind. For example some russian people like to see original english or french films because of studying languages. Another argument is that buying all new films or music disk is too expensive. There are a lot of new films and some people have not money to buy it. For example poor people or children, who are without parents and have no money to do it. But they may download some films or music or watch it on-line in the internet.  For this mind free films are not a theft, because it helps to develop people’s mind.
It is likely to think for people that free music and films in the internet is a better way than buy it. For this opinion downloading of illigal copies should not be punished because of it help and pleasant influence for people’s lifes.

Besides, there are things that sould be solved as fast as it possible, but there is a question: what is more important to invest in?
From my point of view, space exploration is one of the most significant parts of the country's position in the world. The more you are doing for this field, the more priviledges on the international scene you have. First of all, people tent to look in the future and they try to find a better place to live and raise children. For example, the number one issue in the space science: can we find a planet that has all the conditions human beings need? And scientists have been working on it for many years. What's more, today it is seems that the quantity of strenght and money a country spends on the space shows the real potential of this country.
On the other hand, many people think that the social problems such as poverty or greenhouse effect, for instance, are much more important for the society. Firstly, the space exploration requires enormous amount of money which can be spent on lots of problems. Moreover, problems of space do not have average people's attention. They have other problems to deal with and do not see the advantages of being citizens of the great space country.
However, I think that there are a plenty of ways to cope with this issue. If the government invest not so great sums of money in space, it will have more to give people to solve their problems.

Of course, there are reasonable causes to give longer sentence. First of all, there is an opportunity for prisoner to realize what he or she has done, analyze it and regret. Prison services will be able to rehabilitate and re-educate a prisoner. What is more, longer sentences may not only make prisoner regret, but also prevent them from commiting a new crime by teaching. However, some people argue that leaving in prison for a long period means that prisoners will not improve their character, while they live with other criminals. One alternative way is community service. This gives an offender the chance to make something good and positive for the society. Thus, they can improve their character. Furthermore, the government could focus on the causes of crime, which is very important to prevent future crimes. In my opinion, it is important to take into accaunt alternative methods because they are more pieceful and in many cases more efficient. Many prisoners after a long prisoned period cannot adapt to life and have to commit crimes again and again.

The difference between the highest and the lowest point is quite radical as it is 8,1%.

I can not agree with this statement. Because everywhere I see examples of destroying this theory. For sure, noone have ever born with skill of speaking or reading, but it is obvious that people are not the same at this and it is only because they get different education in their family before they go to school. And, as for me, the most essential role in getting children education have parents who become ideals for their sons and daughters. And from how they would teach their children will depend their characteristics during the whole life, because it is the most crutial part of educational process. Moreover, people’s characteristics and skills are developed through the habit and personal surrondings which also take a part in making a person from a human.
Infortunately, I cannot deny a theory the main point of which is connected with persons DNA. It is clear that many great people have not less great children but it also not just because they are their children but because their parents and teachers always educate them in such a way. And there are a lot of examples when such children become not so smart and talanted as their parents, only in case of bad education and absence of needed experience.
In conclusion, I could only add that everyone in the world has its own chance to get all of characteristics that he want and the age for this doesn’t matter anything. It is all only about personal mind, if you want, you can.

On the one hand, of course, the characteristics we are born with have much more influence, because in the childhood we gove lots of important life skills. At this time we lear how to tell with other. It is our first experience in our life and many people think, that in this time we learn more than in adult life. In the childhood we have a lot of face to face conversations and we spend a lot of time with them, because of this, parents opinions and characteristics have much influence. And I think, that this characteristic we take from parents affects on us in all life. Of course these are very important thing in our life.
On the other hand experience we may have in our life is important too, because in adult we learn, how to tell with different people and of course this conversations affect on our mindset and our character. In our life we improve and develop our thinking and connecting skills. We learn making good conversations and take some business judgement. 
To my mind, lots of characteristics we take in conversation with people, with different people, with other mindset and, of coure their opininion affect on us.

How can we reduce crime? There are two points of view on the last question, and we will try to discuss them both in the actual essay.
At the one hand, there is an opinion that we need to give the criminals longer time to spend in the prison.This idea could be suitable, because the prison changes people very much. The lack of freedom, bad conditions and a lot of time to think about their behaviour. Most of murders stop to do steal or kill after they were in the prison. At the same time, this idea is not absolutely right for all the people, because the majority of criminals think that they will never be cought. So, we have to invent somenthing else.
At the other hand, there are a lot of ways to reduce crime in the modern society. The alternative ways to do this consist of many strategies to rise the level of humans live and to turn the condition of their living to the better sight. For example, the government should give the sufficient ammount of work places, to devepol the educational system. The governmemnt have also to improve the economical, social and cultural domains. All these things can help to reduce the crime, because no one will want to steal or to kill someone in a successifull country with the total order in it.

By the way, transporting food by the road is more popular than transporting it by rail (30% to 10%). So, we can think that road transport is more fast than rail-transport (trains), because food is fast-dying material, and speed of transportation is general factor.

To begin with, UK and USA are very rich and developed country and they can spend enough money to make a good and realistic film. Then they know what people need because they feel the mood of our society. There are a lot of fashion clothes there and girls from all the world may look like their favorite characters. Nevertheless, I am sure that the main reason is the fact that the most of countries are oriented on American culture and some people want to look like Americans or British.
Some people wants governments to give money to local industries to develop them. It is a difficult question if governments should give more money to such firms. On the one hand, the level of American and British films is rather high and it would be difficult to do something better or at least the same. However, on the other hand, it can be something new and may give new directions to the cinema.

Several reasons for that can be provided and some solutions can be offered.

First of all, it is widely supposed that modern teenagers have lost the sense of responsibility for their actions. Some of them are overprotected by their parents and that may cause their obcene behavior. Parents should spend more time and effort to explain them the basics of norms that are accepted in the society.

What is more, children that are brought up in a family of alcoholics or drug-addicted parents usually copy their lifestyle. They are nurtured in the atmospere of hatred and cruelty and consider it normal. These young victims can be saved with the help of social service, psychologists and teachers who can truly take care of them and save them from possible future of criminals.

In addition, some movies and video games may affect a child`s flexible mind.
Those that contain murders, rapes, harassment which escape the punishment, may seem realistic to a young player or viewer and trigger him to do the same. Parents can control the content that attracks their children and also convince them that the events shown in films and games are fiction and turning them into life may cause terrible consequences.

To sum up, the rising number of crimes commited by teenajers is a serious social problem. However, following the recommendations given, their intentions to break the law can be prevented at early stages.",70,2,0

And some of them think, that people, who copying, sharing or downloading films or music from internet, should be punished. I would argue that there is two sides of this problem. 

On the one hand, the pirate copies doesn’t let musicians and produsers earning more money, they could lose million of dollars because of pirate copies. Also, because of this reasone they could lose motivation to create anything else. Do you remember what Beoynce said once? ‘If you are adore what I do, if you respect me as a person, if you are my truly fan, you will buy only official products by me’.

On the other hand, let’s look on people who, for example can’t efford a ticket to the cinema? Or they just can’t buy an official Beoynce album in Itunes. So what do they have to do? Are anyone able to make them to stop loving Martin Scorsese movies or Beoynce songs? No. These poor people go to the pirates sites because of love to their favorites actors/singers. Not because of bad minds or something like that. 

In conclusion I want to say, that downloading a pirate copies from internet isn’t a crime, it makes singers/actors more famous anyway. And maybe, if the pirate copies problem will be solved one day, all this famous people could lose a lot of their truly fans.

The portion of chemicals transported by rail was accounted for 11% and its percentage of goods transported by road was 16%, that is almost equal to the first one.

Children start to attend classes of foreign languages since their early childhood. However, it is argued that such an early age is appropriate for study of this difficult subject. In this case, are there more advantages than disadvantages in learning language in primary school?
On the one hand, if a child starts to learn foreign language in primary school, he can become an expert in this language in the future. Moreover, children get used to what they study for a long period of time. Continuing this study, a child becomes to speak fluently.
On the other hand, children do not understand what for they have to learn foreign language. Consequently, the study is likely to be inefficient in this age. Nevertheless,  a child, who enters the primary school, has no idea about the number of subjects he will have to study. In this way, it is very tough for a child to study so much at first.
However, I tend to think that the best way to learn language is to start it in the childhood. One more reason for it is that it is more easy to teach children. What I mean is that children have a good memory and it can be enough to make lessons attractive and funny, so that children will be interested in them. 
To conclude, there were presented both points of view about the advantages and disadvantages of learning foreign languages at primary school. However, the advantages are stronger. Many more people will agree with that. That is why a lot of children nowadays start learning foreign languages so early. I believe that it yields better results.

To say another way, they move of developing countries and give the work places to the local. In this essay I will try to look through some pros and cons of this process. Firstly, having transferred  his own business to poorer country, employer can easily find cheaper workers who are ready to bring income to his company. This way, it is quite possible to decrease the level of poverty in this country and move its economic situation more stable. But there is a high possibility, that there are few qualified workers. With big background who will be able to work hard. That is why the company can’t increase its income and can be destroyed. Secondly, not only company’s moving let us owner wide the working network around the world, but also he can get nesessarily connections which will mark his company among the others. Moreover, if the company uses earth’s sources in the production, it is more likely to found out new ones in another country. But if the company has moved. For example, only one year ago, it easily can meet with problems with the government or the different local companies with the same direction of the work. To conclusion, I would like to say, that the way of company’s moving has more advantages than disadvantages. So if I were an owner of an international company, I would probably open it in the developing country.

Another example, there is a steady deterioration in real meatings and talking face-to-face. People lose some issential skills.

However, many people disagree with that. Let`s look into it. 
The approach of building more sports facilities is really straight-forward. Those who vote for it believe that there is a proportion between the amount of people who do sport and the number of stadiums and such. Be that as it may, they thinks it`s the best way. On the one hand, this seems like a nice and simple solution, also because these facilities will be of use to professional sportsmen.
On the other hand, it may not be so simple. First of all, because in order for these facilities to run properly, it takes a lot of resources for its staff, maintenance an the energy it consumes. Many people think that this is not cost-effective. They suggest measures like promoting sports, especially outdoors. It is said to be cheaper and more effective to motivate people to do sports by themselves, without necessarily using special sports facilities. Also, they say that it`s very effective to take care of your nutrition, as it has a great influence on the way we feel. 
I personally think that building new sports facilities is a good measure. But certainly not the best. I believe that public health is more than just doing sports. But even if we talk about sport, motivation is much more important than the amount of sports facilities around. The motivation to do sports is what makes people do it, not the stadiums.

Two ways of overcoming this problem are offered. The first wag is the limited term ban for the sportsmen using illegal drugs. Another way is the ban of such sportsmen for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view and then offer a variant of solution.
Regarding the first opinion, there is a strong arguement to support it. A large number of famous sportsmen whose name is brand (e.g. Usain Bolt) need to use drugs for good results in large scale competitions. To give these sportsmen a ban for the rest of their lives means to deprive the companies using their names (e.g. clothes producers) from their incomes. An arguement against this point of view is that commercialisation of sport is itself an issue to struggle with.
As for the second opinion, it has a strong arguement to support, like the previous one. This is the way to prevent sport from further commercialisation. However, as mentioned, today sport is an unique source of incomes for plenty of companies. It is certainly the case that if sport becomes less commercial, many employees of these companies will be left without work places.
To conclude, it seems impossible for me to find a viable solution of the problem under discussion.

There is an opinion that pirates who steal the data and upload it to the World Wide Web and people copying these files to their PCs should be fined. There is also an opinion that there is nothing bad in this situation. I would like to express my point of view on this issue.

From my opinion, the process of pirating films and music is illegal. Filmstudios and showbuisness industry spends a huge amount of money on their films and musical albums. The whole industry will become poor, the Hollywood will end its remaining and millions of people who work in this sphere will become unemployed.

Nevertheless, I think that CDs and DVD discs cost too much nowadays. In the situation of global economical crisis which continues nowadays, people can’t afford themselves to buy it. I believe the main key to the solution of this problem is the decrease of the prices on the official CDs and DVDs. Also there should be more stores where people could buy it in the world because sometimes people start downloading films from the Intertnet because of the lack of filmshops in their area.

To continue, I suppose goverments should add fines for copying and sharing digital files on the internet to stop the process of stealing films and music.

In the conclusion, I would like to stress that I believe pirates who make illegal copies of films and music should be stricktly punished and fined for their crime.

We can make a conclusion that in 2000 Africa had a crucial problem connected with education. Later, there was an abrupt change. In 2012 Africa was able to decline the proportion in gender. Perhaps, it was associated with interversion of another countries which wanted to help Africa’s people. It is nessesary to consider South Asia which is very interesting too. We noted that girls had a small access to primary school education (21,6, 11,3). I propose it involved traditions which tend to  describe that women should be only a housewife. But in the future some conditions was changing. The amount of boys and girls have approximately equal figures (4,8; 5,1). In 2012 the world has a positive effect in educational system.

To begin with, most business and leisure air travel contributes to the economical state of the governments. The budget of the majority of hot countries depends on the tourism rates and the amount of people visting their country annually. For example, the southern european countries, such as Bulgaria and Greece, rely on the industries providing a wide range of service to tourists, comming round annually. The more the amount of visiters will be, the higher the government will earn.

Moreover, a lot of modernised air companies already meet ecological regulations, introducing eco-friendly designs, prohibiting overbooking and regularly rising costs in the most favourable tourism seasons.
In conclusion, there are some people who support air travel restriction, yet I believe that it will have a detrimental effect on the economicies of tourism countries and stop the development of the air travel industry on a global scale.",70,2,1

They help these poore people to get enough money for the living. Those who works for the new company will gain enough resources to support themselves and family members. Moreover, local workers need certain skills for being employed and international corporation are opened to teach that skills.

It is clear that a ban for a limited period seems to be relevant. An athelet could consider that as a punishment and understand that this his act migh be valued as a crime. Also for example two years break would'n damage a sport cancer of this participant. Moreover an athelet could use this time for more intensve and fruitful sport doing. However feeling no fullfulment and satisfaction such person can have a desire to take this chance again and be more careful using drugs in the next competition.

Probably it could be another decent way although it might be called even cruel, because at the other hand the career and of even such life person would be ruined for eternity. According in rent difficulties in thee modern world due with new job searches it's actually strong punishment.
To my mind the way of limited period ban is more better way. If an athelet accepted his or her mistake he (or she) would start to develop the sport career again. However I suppose that if a person uses such illegal drugs the second time it will be actually needed to ban him for the rest of the life.

Firstly, moving a business to another country means an expand of its spectre of influence. For example, Apple Company will start selling their products in North Africa and from that they will get a profit and potential costumers who will continue buying their goods. Also, according to “The Guardian” ‘s research if developing countries will go out on an international market the profit will increase by 30%. Secondly, employing local workers decides each government’s problem: unemployment. According to financial research it seems that in Samsung Company in Los Angeles work 30000 people. Now imagine if such company will establish their filial in Egypt and how many people can have a possibility to get well-paid job. Thirdly, starting a business in developing countries also helps it’s economy. New investments will stimulate the national economy and the country’s government can overcome the crisys or money in different spheres. On the other hand, there are some problems companies can face in such countries. For instance, there would not be many classified workers company can employ or the political situation does not allow to start business here. Besides, there can not be a lot of potential costumers and company will only lose from an investment. However, I think that these problems depend on time and companies, for example, can make courses for potential workers of just wait until the situation will not be stable.

There are several improvement in life due to the positive effects of technology and there are some negative impacts as well. One area that has dramatically changed is the way we communicate and maintain our relationship nowadays.

The issue is that they are closing, because of the new big stores instead of. I think that there are more advantages than drawbacks. Let us consider them in this essay.
To begin with, I want to mention plusses of this topic. in multinational brands one can find everything for any taste. There is a big variety of goods from some things for houses to clothes, for example. Moreover,there is no need to visit a big number of shops, beacuse with the large malls you have an opportunity to buy anything you want in one place and with a great choice. Also, such kinds of shops are located near to underground or bus stations, if you have not got a car, it is very convenient to go to, while local shops are more likely to be situated in the city centre or in the neigborhoods of it.

Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, local shops have their own atmosphere, they are not conjested as the big one's.
And almost all small shops are specialized in one sphere, so if you need something extraordinary, you are probably to find it there.

To sum up, I would like to say that local shops have some benefits, but in our modern world it is better to open large brands, which includes almost everything in it. This kind of shops will help people to save time, that is very important in oue lives today.
That is why the advantages outwegh the drawbacks.",60,2,3

On the other hand, birth rate slightly decreased from 38 to 34 per 1000. As a result, the USA population grew to 25 million people.

Crime is one of the biggest problems in our society. We should always try to reduce its level over and over. Many people think that the best ways to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences others believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime. We will discuss about views and try to give our opinion about this problem. There is number of problems in giving longer prison sentences. Firstly, more prisons should be built, because number of prisoners will increase. Consequently, government will spend more money for them, because criminalists have to eat too and more staff to serve the will be needed. Secondly, many criminalists think that they will never be caught. So they will not to stop break the law just because of more serious punishment. I think that first of all country should solve problems in its government system. In our country many people in this system are corrupted and the biggest drug and weapon dealers will never be locked in prison because they have enough money to give it to right people in this system.  I am not expert in this field, but in my opinion should beer cottuption and we can see that it happens, but happens slightly. And we can help our country being honest with law.

And now when we have more right of freedom and less censors we feel better. But some people ordinary and also some artists use it in uncorrectable ways.

In this essay I would like to discuss the reasons and probable solutions of this problem.
The first cause of such behaviour can be vulnurability of young people. They can be influenced a lot easier than children who still see their parents as authorities or adults who are more responsible for their actions and are aware of how they can effect their future. The teenagers need to show that they are worth being respected by all means. This is why they are being used in commiting crimes. Another possible reason may be lust for money and luxurious life. If parents are not able to give their children money or if they are just poor, young people will try to seek for another opportunity to get them. Since they do not have higher education, the only way some children find is committing crime.
First plausible solution to the problen can be envolving teenagers in different kinds of voluntary work. In this case they will learn that it is much better to help other people than to harm them in any way. Another variant may be opening some vacancies for young people either during summer time or in their free time. Through this important experience they will understand how hard it is to earn money and will not have to ask their parents for cash. Moreover, as for working with the teenagers who have already committed crimes meetings with prisoners can be arranged, who will tell these young children how they really regret doing that. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is highly important to show young children the consiquencies of committing crimes, to make them realise that it is not an easy way of getting money.",70,2,0

One part of society believe that athletes, who were noticed using illegal drugs would be better banned from sport sphere for limited time. Another part consider such sportmen should be excepted from sport competitions for the whole life. In this essay I will discuss both points of view and give my own one.
For some people it is important to punish sportmen, who use illegal drugs by banning from competing professionally only for a limited period, because the list of illegal drugs is rather wide and include some medicine, which are legal in some countries. For example, the public conflict with Maria Sharapova, who used drugs, which are sold in any drugstore of Russia, to get rid of her flue and backache. Sportmen don't want to feel suffered and have no possibility to do their job, that's why they take such illegal medicine. That's why some people believe that the punishment for this illegal act shouldn't be very strict, because sportmen had valuable reasons.
On the other hand, it is thought that sportmen that used illegal drugs should be excepted from competitions for the rest of their life, because they didn't follow main rules of sport comitee and sport ethic. First, some people consider that if sportsman uses illegal drugs, it means that he doesn't know the rules of his job and that's why he is unprofessonal. Secondly, many people believe that the use of illegal medicines by sportmen is a consequence of their great wish to be the first on competition, even if they don't have a lot of force and professional qualities. This fact is percepted by many people as a lie, not only to other people, but to yourself. Due to this thoughts a part of society think that sportmen, who use illegal drugs can't take part in competitions anymore.
In my opinion, it is necessary to ban from competing professionally for the rest of the life such sportmen who stepped the antidrug law, because these competitors catch possibility of other honest athletes to take part in sportgames in illegal way. However, I consider that investigation of these cases should be done in more careful way, as it wasn't happened with Russan athlet team for summer Olympic games 2016.
All things considered, both points of view on banning illegal drug. Sportmen users can exist, but it's really important to regulate the antidoping system at first.

On the contrary, others claim that this measure will be not enough to help people keep fit.
If government or private firms will decide to build more sport centers, it will be of a big help for those, who had to spend hours reaching the nearest sport facility, or of those who did not have such opportunity at all. So, it will not be required to have a car to go in for sport. Moreover, due to always encreasing population of cities, new places for children in sport clubs are needed. Today we have overcrouded groups and strict competitions for the place, when coaches are only doing an opportunity for those who have a talent. Of course, new sport facilities will solve this problem. But will it be enough?
Other people support another opinion. They consider that new sport centers will not solve the problem of people`s health, because only that will not encourage them to go there. We should inform people about healthy life-style and its opportunities and advantages. More than that, they say that sometimes the real problem is the cost. We should pay a considerable amount of money to visit a sport center today. Thus, not everybody can ever afford it. So, we should adjust prices to encourage people to do sports and to improve their health. 
To conclude, it should be said that, all measures should be taking into consideration, because there is nothing more important than health.

The graphs show the reasons for studying and the amount of support received by students of different age from employers.
It is clear that studying for different career purposes is more popular among young people, whereas talking about more mature persons studying for some personal interests is of a great interest. For example: judjing by the last two charts of the first graph, it is obvious that the amount of students over 49 years old who are chosen some course to be successful in their career is approximately 4 times less than the number of those who decided to study for their own interest. The next interesting point is , however mainly the amount of students in the first graph differ quite a lot , the last but one two bars are absolutely equal, so among people between 40 and 49 years old it seems to be the same way, in which they prefer to study. 
The second graph illustrates the percentage of employer support given to employees divided into different age groups from slightly under 26 to over than 49 years old. The level of support declines gradually starting from over 60 percent of support at the age of under 26 and reaching its minimum at the level of approximately 30 percent at the age of 30 – 39. But starting from 40 to 39 years it begins to climb, then it reaches the level of 40 percent at the level of slightly over than 49 years. 
To conclude, the preferences of students differ very much in terms of what kind of education (for career or for interest) choose and it depends on the age of a student. What is more, employers support is depend on the age of an employee too.

I think Planes is one of the greatest invention ever. First of all, It saves time. What is utmost important for businessmen. Secondly it is save, as accidents happen very seldom. Then, there are such destinations which hard to reach by means of transport. For example the way from Moscow to Washington takes 13 hours travelling by air, at the same time it would take a couple weeks to go there by trains and ship. 
Nevertheless it is clear that air pollution by planes is significant. They consume a huge amount of fuel and then emit it in the air. The damage from which the environment.Suffers is great and the most essential point is that we can’t fix it. 
I think that the solution may be found easily. The governments should ban all air travels for short distances. At the same time they have to develop introstructures for example, make trains to go faster or to buid roads for speed moving. 
In conclusion I would like to say, that plane is a good mean of transport and it should not be prohibited at all. We must find ways to use planes more seldom to save our planet Earth.

Nowadays we may find the problem of seres in the job area or professional area. All of us understand that for giving a job you need to have a gpecial education. In our case - it will be the higher education - study at university.
So there is an opinion that every faculty should accept equal numbers of females and males. I have to arguments. One of the will be for that idea and the second will be against.
As for me, it will be right if women will have the same rights in all of the spheres. I know there is a common opinion that the most amount of men are mathematics and think more logical, among of them there is a plenty of great scientist. But it's not fair to think so, because women may use information in different way. I mean that women may find truly ""new ways"" in mens areas. As the example I may name Maria Curi who made a real revolution in science where traditionaly were occupied only males.
The argument against is not very complicated , but strong. I think that universities shouldn't accept equal numbers in every subject. That's because men have much possibilities than women. They have another minds and nature. Women body have another musculs, they are thiner and their height is not so much.

It could be seen that there are a jreat disbalance between women and men  in some subjects such as education or engineering. It is connected with a gender discrimination and many people want to end up with it.
From my point of view, it is obvious and normal that there are different numbers of girls and boys students in some subjects such as life-risk activities or really hard jobs that are unsuitable for women or men due to their physical characteristics. It is impossible for women to lift 100 kilo weijht things. However, there are some exceptions in each sphere, but it is more connectable with the Record Books.
Despite the fact there are some exceptions and unique situations, it is unfair to appreciate one gender more than the other. In many countries there are no discrepancy between male and female – only really intelligent, smart and talented people enter the university. If this rule is done, the situation will fair because there are no difference with gender a person is – the main idea is about his or her talent and abilities
It could be seen that I am against gender discrimation, but only really good-motiveted students should be accepted by universities and it does not matter which his or her gender is. Nowadays there are big numbers of works and jobs where could be employed male and female persons at the equal level.

For example, the most dramatic variation happens in skilled vocational diploma section with 90 percent of males having this diploma compared to only 10 percent of women. Another serious gap occures, for instance, in postgraduate diploma level with a 40 percent differential led by men.
On the other hand, the proportion of men and women who got bachelor's degree is quite even, followed by a medium-sized 20 percent gap in getting master's degree.
As a conclusion, it is needed to be mentioned that males are more tend to continue getting their post-school degrees and diplomas until the very end, while females are tend to be contendent with their bachelor's degree or undergraduate diploma, but not less than that.

According to my mind, increasing the number of sports facilities is the good way of improving public healts. Because each person could fond some activity which is really usefull for him. “As many people – as many minds” - it is the best argument for this position. However, I think that thease way of improving public health should be mixed with social adverticement and TV programs.

While the idea of such a system suggests nothing but positive effects on citizens, there can be a few not as obvious drawbacks that are worth being mentioned.
It goes without any doubt that the system can have a positive influence on people and the whole society itself. I will take under consideration a few of them which seem to be the most significant to me. Firstly, it could provide citizens with a chance to start saving money for things they were not able to afford before. For instance, college for their children, a new house or their own business. Secondly, as this system represents a guaranteed source of income, people will not be afraid to quit the job they do not like in order to find a new one or move to another city and start a new life.
At the same time, there are some disadvantages to be listed as well. In my opinion, this idea sounds good in theory, but not in practice. Where do politicians plan to get money from? The only answer I can come up with is them rising taxes. And if it will be this way, what is the point in introducing the idea? What is more, it could be assumed that many people might want to leave their job as they will be satisfied with the amount of money they will be provided.
In conclusion, pros and cons of a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system are quite evident. In my opinion, its benefits will not outweigh the drawbacks as I consider possible disadvantages to be of high importance.",70,2,1

Secondly, it is always cheaper to rent the land of building for your business needs in the developing countries. The prices there are not as high as in developed countries.

People concerned with this problem, and we should find reasons, why teenagers commite crimes, and how we can solve this problem.
The first reason of this problem can hide in a childhood. Nowadays parents spend a lot of time at work. This causes lack of time, which parents should give to their childrens. This lack leads us to lack of education about good and evil, and concequences of evil steps. There could be another reason of our problem. Poor families quite often have more than one child. If parents don’t try to educate their children properly before school, children can get in some bands. People from these bands can provide teenagers with money, but they will ask teenagers to do some “dirty job”.
There are a lot of solutions of this problem. First of all, parents should give more attention to their children and spend more time with them. These points can increase trust in future, and parents will be able to understand, with whom their childrens are communicating more. Therefor, government should pay more attention to the poor group of nation, and make thought-provoking propaganda about crimes. These measures will help children to avoid marginal groups of people.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that problem of rising amount of youngsters, who commites a crime, can be solved by parents, teachers and government. The main idea is to give more time and attention to children and their social life.

The most significant problem is cancer which could be triggered by mobile phones and other devises that uses waves. Although scientists said that microwaves is safe for health there are still lack of information in other positions, for example, micro wave diagnosty. Other wide spreaded problem refers to mental diseas. Everyday surfing on the Internet leads to anxiety and depression. Social networking also is a cause of syndrome of lack of attention and the main reason while individuals often easily loos concentration. Information nowadays is overwhelming, people spend too much attention on bright buttons and youtube videos and then don’t able to focus on important work.

There are some solutions to this problem. First of all, people have to be informed about dmagin features of some devices. For example, teenagers to that was talked about mobile phones influences on brain tend to charge their iPhones away from their bed. Another way to reduce health probles is to fund projects that develop safer technologies, especially medicine industry. When it comes to mental health, governments all over the world should be concentrated on developing sence of fullfillment and meaning of life in their citizens and try to attract them live in a real life, not it the imaginative mobile world. Socialization, since it leads to cohesion, is also significant, conection between human being is a need, not just a want.

The problem now is far from being solved, but I believe that people would find the answer and build happier and heathier future for next generations.

Let us consider who's opinion is more reasonable.
To begin with, on the one hand, public health can be increased by such method, but, I think, only among the people of young age. They have much free time and, of course, the big number of sport facilities will definitery grab their attention and make them more interested and involved in sport, and that's why their health and physical form will improve.
However, on the other hand, I don't think that public health can really be improved in such a way.In every town there exists, at least, some sport centres, gyms, etc. If people were interested in it, they have an opportunity to become healthier by taking up some sport. But we can see that it is not really effective. of course, many people do sport and they like it, but it can't improve public health. I suppose that there should be taken some other methods to achieve this goal. For example, the government should make medical system at all cheaper, so that everyone can visit a medical centre with any reason and get help there. What is more, public health can be increased by making people more interested in sport, but not by big number of sport facilities.
To conclude, it is difficult to give a clearcut answer to the question whether or not public health will improve by increasing the number of sport facilities. I thin that that goal can be achieved only by a complex system of actions of a government, but increasing the number of sport facilities will definitely influence on it in some way.

In fact a lot of time and money will be spent for reaching a necessary level of skills of local workers. Also some old factories needed to renovate and changing the diveces and technics items. Furthermore it is hard to manage already an international organisation. It is followed by increasing of staff and responsibilities. To sum up it is a controversial question.

Sport centers and sport shops can reduce prices for sport equipment or for club cards to do different sports. There is no evidence that someone is not interested in some sports, but it can be difficult to buy equipment. For instance, hockey defence for goalkeeper has the enourmous price. Secondly, government can provide different policies which will make investors more interested in building sport areas or sport center for everyone. Also government can make it free or with some preveuligues for special groups of people.
On the other hand, increasing the number of sport facilities will not help to improve people`s health in significant way. Also it depends on people. People who interested in sports but do not want to do it will not feel the increasing number of sport facilities. There are other better ways to improve public health. For instance, governments can also provide policies which will have different restrictions for alcohol or smoking. As we know, modern world has such examples and you can find it in history. Public health depends on mentality and worldsight of people. Also sport fashion has the influense. For example, during the Olympic games, young people become more interested in hockey and they wanted to play.
In conclusion, i want to say that health improvement depends on differents things and everybody and every country should choose the right and optimal way to do it with help of facilities or something else.

One supposes that it should start in the primary school, another in the secondary school. In my point of view, languages must be begin to learn as early as possible. There are several advantages of it and they will be explained in this essay.
First of all, child memory is better than adult one. This fact was proved by scientists, children get new knowledges faster and more qualified than other people. For example, many sport activities are requared  to begin in the early ages: skating, hocking, athleting – in these sports it is impossible to become successful professional sportsmen if you begin do it later.
Secondly, it is more efficience for children, because of big amount of free time in the primary school. There are not many different subject that are obligated to study by pupils and they may to spend more time for learning foreign language. In secondary school there are various of difficult and complicated subject, for instance chemistry and physics, which requares all time to be learn properly. 
In conclusion, it should be said that there is no disadvantages of the chance to begin study foreign language earlier than in secondary school, because process of learning for children in the primarily school is more easier than in the secondary school, and, what is more, pupils in the primarily school have less subjects to study and consequently lot of time to study language.

That is why nowadays governments try to invent a beneficial system of rewarding for citizens to always have some capital in case of emergency. One of these experimental programs is “Guaranteed Basic Income”, promising a sum of money paid monthly to everyone, whether a person has work or not.
Obviously such a project has a vast number of advantages. Firstly, it guarantees life for everyone, recessing the spreading of poor and homeless population layers. Secondly, in the end the sum paid could be sent back to the government, stabilizing the taxes paying and the financial circulation in the bank system. Moreover, it would certainly improve the quality of life and strengthen the international authority of the country.
However, there are some evident disadvantages. To begin with, the monthly paid sum of money could discourage population from work at all. Let us take the example of modern France, where similar law, concerning only people without any job, encourages thousands of migrants and poor people to benefit from it. What is more, every initiative connected with money could collapse the financial system of no matter which country with no stable income.
Personally I do not suppose that such a suggestion could see the daylight, the disadvantages totally outweighing the benefits. On one hand, it requires a strong financial background of the country in question. On the other hand, this kind of program would appeals to lower classes, which would provoke its boost.
Finally, as long as financial problems are crucial, people will be inventing a huge range of methods to solve it equally for everyone.",70,2,0

Whether it's watching sport match on TV or going to a live event, some people are convinced that it doesn't make any sense to devote so much time and energy to something so trivial as sport. In this essay I will try to support this idea by providing my own opinion on this matter.
First and foremost, rooting for your favorite team can result in violence. A lot of sports fans feel so involved with the game that if their favorite team gets knocked out, it aggravates them so much that they cause disturbance to other people. The prime example would be the numerous fan fights that occured during the World Cup.
Secondly, being just a fan and not actually doing sports is a waste of time. Instead of sitting on the couch and whining about how the players perform, it would more beneficial to your health, both mental and physical, to go out and excersise. For instance, it has been proven by various studies that most sports fans don't work out themselves.
But nevertheless, some people claim that being a sports fans and rooting for your country during world championships bring the country together. But I believe that this is not true as most of the time it only fosters animocity between countries.
Take the Olympics for example, many countries get banned from participating in the games, which leads to conflicts.
To sum up, it's evident that the disadvantages of watching sports outweigh the advantages. Therefore, it's clear that it's a waste of time.",75,2,0

There is an opinion that the increase of the variety of sport facilities can solve this problem. However, other people think that it’s not the right way and it won’t help somehow.
First of all, the bigger number of the sport facilities can solve the situation with the health, because it’s a good way of giving people different opportunities. Secondly, if such facilities are able for everyone and are free or not so expensive, this may encourage people to try something new in their life. Moreover, the increase of the sport facilities can be the cause of the new trends such as, for example, healthy lifestyle. This can led to a good impression on the society and the public health will be improved.
On the other hand, it is necessary to remember that if a person does not want to take care on his health, nothing can persuade him, or only a strong disease. And that is the main reason why the variety of sport facilities might be useless.
Personally I strongly believe that by increasing the number of sport facilities it is possible to solve only a part of the problem. As a whole it can be solved only by giving people an idea as a healthy lifestyle is something good, useful and worth doing. Here can be used advertisements, TV programmes etc.
To sum up, public health needs to be improved in different ways. Not only one method of changing sport facilities’ number can be used here, as it was said earlier.

In my essay I am going to examine this question from both points of view. On the one hand there are those who argue that the best way to reduce crime is to make prison sentences longer. The main reason for believing this is the fact that longer sentences will make criminals think more and hesitate more while having in intention to commit a crime. It is also worth pointing that the violent and mentally ill people will be isolated from the society for a longer period and this increases safety of the civilians. On the other hand, there are people who think that the humanity should search for alternative ways to make the crime level decrease. They think so because not letting the crimes happen is a better and an easier way to reduce crime. It is more efficient to create a better social environment, and try to fight against social unsatisfaction, which leads to the main part of the crimes, than to punish criminals with longer prison sentences. I can add that it is scientifically proved that severe punishments such as really long sentences or death do not reduce the crime levels. Also, there is always a risk of the judgement mistake and the person who is not guilty will suffer from it. As we can see, there are no simple answers to this question. In balance, however, I tend to believe that alternative ways to solve this problem are better, because it seems to me more efficient not to let the crime happen, then to make the punishment more severe.",70,2,2

The question is: what are the causes of this problem?
To begin with, it needs to be said there are a lot of both direct and indirect reasons why youngsters do such things. First of all, this is about social stratification and distribution of wealth in society. In fact, there is a huge gap between the poor and the rich, and most of people in the world live in poverty. Consequently, there is no other way for such teenagers to make ends meet, but to become a criminal. In this case, it is up to the government to solve the problem on this level. Probably, they have to help them to find a job or get an education. Secondly, in some cases parents give their children either inappropriate nurture or do not care about them at all. The statistics shows that only 65% of parents are really aware of their child's life and help them to overcome some problems and hurdles. The solution is to explain young and adult parent that it it vital to communicate with children, bring them up properly and prepare for a real life.

They believe that after three ways of feminism it is important to give the ability to ambitious women as well as to men, who chose to take jobs, traditionally cons, dered as a woman – type job, to realize themselves in a tolerant society. 
Moreover, the equal number of male and female students in classes provokes honest competition regardless gender stereotypes, they state. 
However, if we take a deeper look at the problem, we can notice that the proposed solution to ruin gender stereotypes involves positive discrimination first. Since we help a person to get into class we ourselves buit up new stereotypes. It becomes significantly difficult to get over gender stereotypes if it is not a success of a person to get into class but our help. We do want to have an example that would encourage people to find their best role and selfrealise. However, the more we set special conditions the bigger problem with gender stereotypes is. 
In my opinion, it is necessary to set the conditions that would allow any student to get into class based on his/her academic performance rather than stay for equal representation that stay for equal representation that build up new stereotypes such as ""you would never get this place otherwise itself"".

I completely agree with idea that everybody should pay for other men’s labor, so the government should punish people who make pirate copies and who spread it. It can be proved by some arguments.
To begin with, all money which musicians and producers are not get from pirate copies may be leant to developing their industry and making new unique art smashing content. The leak of resourses sometimes slows down process of making it.
Then, using illegal pirate copies is iquel with stealing goods. Modern governments usually punish robbers, that is why, this rule should be spread to such content.
Finally, the ban of using illegal copies will dicrease a shadow sector of an economy of a country. It will lead to growing of cashflow to dealers too.
So many men, so many minds. We can not say that this or that opinion is wrong. But in this particular case a punishment for spreaders and users of illegal content will bring to life a lot of positive results. which one associated with clearing an economy, growing benefits for dealers and increasing of motivation level among musicians and film producers. The government may establish low price for such content to make it available for big masses of people.

These years, mostly in Russia, a great amount of sports events are taking part. To take an example, the Olimpics in Sochi, International Students Games and etc.. In addition, I would like to pay attention to the importance and strong influence of sport on children, the future of our planet and human being.
But, on the other hand, if we give up an opinion about sport, we will find a lot effective opportunities to make public health increased. Having thought about the youth, we are able to enter the extra class in schools connected with healthy diet, knowledge about the way our body works and its necessary needs.

As far as I am concerned, this problem can't be solved only by one specific measure. From my point of view, the best way to improve public health is increase level of each reasonable cause. In other words, people should insist on the healthy lifestyle including spot, diet, relax, eight hours of sleeping, spending time outdoors and so forth.

It is clear, that modern technologies, such as mobile phones, laptops and others, have significant influence on health. The main reason of problems, which can start after using some popular modern technologies, is dangerous waves, which produce all modern phones, laptops and other technological products. One of the most popular problem, which very often people can have after long-term using their phones is problems with eyes, they cannot see small details without special glasses. Moreover, people can have other problems, such as cancer, because we try to have our technical products always with us. 

Nevertheless, we can reduce some of problems. First of all, people should try to increase the time of using their phones and other technologies.

It is unreal to live nowadays without any modern technological products, but  people should try to increase their level in daily life.

And due to this problem some people think that those ones who share such content must face the law. As for me, I partly agree with introducing punishments for them due to next reasons.
First of all, there is no doubt that it is absolutely illegal, because those moves lead to great losses of musicians and film producers. Almost all of the people would prefer to just download free content instead of paying for it, if there is one. For instance, most of my groupmates wait for the pirate copies of the films and do not pay in cinema for tickets. In that case panishement will defenetly motivate them to stop making illegal moves and start paying for content.
Moreover, in copied content there can be misreprented information, for example, not official translations or cut scenes, so the overviews will be low and will not show the real picture of the film. May be because of that film produers will not be sponsored in the future anymore. This problem was common for Russia at the very beginning of the century, when people did not have enough money to buy films or music and they just got pirate translated content which was absolutely incorrect like “Goblin’s” one.
On the other hand, there are still a lot of people in any country who can not afford to pay for it, but they support right’s owners by sharing it with friends, who may have money and desire to buy it. For instance, my friend last year recommended me film called “the hatefull eight” after watching it illegally online. But thanks to that I wathed it in cinema even 2 times, because of it grateness.
Overall, there are pros and cons of 100% punishment for “pirates”, but it really depends on the area, where they live, whether it poor or rich one.

They propose some ways to solve it. Some people think it can be solved by increasing number of sports facilities.  However, other people are convinced that it is not the way out, and another measures are required. I totally agree that improvement of sports equipment is not enough to improve population health. 
In the modern world, a lot attention and efforts is paid to sports facilities. Government allocates significant sums on building new football field, basketball boxes and another places to spend time efficiently with benefit to health. Schools are also engaged in this process and spend a lot of money to equip their sport halls. And some changes can be seen. For instance, children go out from their homes, not spend time watching TV and surfing the Internet, but communicate with friends by playing in active games. As a result, they don`t have problems with health. 
Nevertheless, this only method can`t dramatically change the situation, another measures are needed. In particular, television has a great impact on people, especially, on young generation. It promotes some negative and inapropriate ideas like drinking and smoking through TV comercial and another sources. Another sphere which sometimes has a negative influence in music. Lyrics of many groups, sometimes even famous like containts awful words and situations which, sequentially, are repeated by young audience. The only way to improve the situation is to check  these sources and, if needed, impose some penalties on companies which spread ideas of unhealthy way of life. Secondly, alcohol and cigaretes are the most important source demaging our health. That`s way if government ellimite illegal sales of this products and punish dishonest producers the situation may positively changed. Besides, it can increase pices on harmful production, thus, public will no incentive to smoke and drink. 
To sum up, the only way to improve public health is not to prohibit something, because it is useless, but to influence people mentally through promotion of healthy way of life with the help of TV and the Internet.

I disagree with this statement for a series of reasons.

Firstly, nowadays people can make a decision pay for an entertainment content or not. These circumstances provide an opportunity not give a lot of money for something you maybe will not like at all.

Secondly, expose to lack of laws copying and sharing music on the Internet continues to grow, It is not costumer’s fault that special governement organizations can not protect the online information. It is evident that people who downloads pirate content are just users, they do not make a crime like producers of illegal copies.

However, there is an opposite point of view. Some people argue that if people will know about certain consequances of their doings like punishment, they will stop downloading illegal information. It probably a good idea for future experience but it requires a huge government spendings and new technologies to know who hacks the sources or break the law.

So, the only way to stop the crimes with author’s rights is to create a better system to regulate producing pirate copies.

In conclusion, money should not be such important for musicians and film producers because their masterpieces were made to bring beauty to the world, it should be more precious for an artist than making money.

So punishment for Internet users will not lead to decreasing of pirate content and increasing in artists savings.

That is not a secret that labour in developing countries is cheeper than in developed ones. So it seems rather thoughtful to reduce the amount of money people invest in business. A second reason is recources. It is very clever to try to avoid such problem facing the mankind as overpopullation. Going to another country where many natural resourses and not so many people may simplify the process of producing something.  A last reason but not the least is that there is a possibility to improve the technic development, to show the locals new science inventions or to invent something important on the area, where it's necessary.

Many people are aware that illegal copying music and films should be punished, while others consider that it is not illegal action.
From my point of view, the copying is the same as the theft and should be banned on the Internet. One convincing argument in favor of is that it leads to big costs for musicians and film producers. As a result of it, the price of original products becomes higher and other people, who would like to listen to music or to watch a new film, should pay for these illegal actions on the Internet. Some of them are not able to do it, so they have not alternative ways to buy an access to original products and tended to use the Internet, too. The last, but not least argument is that the illegal pirate copies usually have a low quality, and people form their opinion about the work of musician; artist or film director according to these works. As a result of it, there are negative comments, which, unfortunately, affected the significance of the film and forme public opinion.
However, some people claim that illegal copying and sharing different types of art is an essential action and should not be punished. They consider that illegal pirate copies make films available for everyone. The high prices for discs and tickets at the cinema or exhibition make art available only for people with high income. But pirate copies are available for everyone on the Internet and people may watch a film or listen to music for free.
I strongly disagree with this point of view. As it was mentioned before, the price for all films and music depends on costs, which musicians and films directors have. If the government had addressed the problem 10 years ago or imposed strict laws against illegal copying, the situation could be changed and the price of all products could be significantly smaller, which would definitely make art available for everyone.
In conclusion I would like to say that copying and sharing music or films on the Internet creates a lot of problems for original authors and should be banned in order to protect their property. But this protection should be closely connected with measures against high price for music and art, which should make it available for everyone.

I strongly believe that international companies give  helping hand and do q good deal for all world this way, I can name only one cons despite many positive sides. To begin with, many countries suffer from pack of work places. People have to work on low salary job to feed their family. Big companies found a solution and give opportunity to work in comfortable conditions with career growth. For example, Valio factories in Russia. They were opened by finnish businessmen and helped many Russians to find work, moreover this improvement increased quality of milk products in our country. Another main benefit of moving businesses to poorer countries is innovations which new employees can create. All shereas of business need changings and transformation. New clear brains of workers from developing countries can really bring significant achievements to their bosses. Fresh ideas can not only help in business profit but it make people to be proud for their succeses. I read about psychological factor of developing business in one book, and the author said that poor workers usually try to be usefull for them employeres more than other workers. There is only one disadvantage of this development big amount of money and time, which companies should spend on moving their business. But this is just a small problems, compared with all benefits.

Some people claims that building new sport centres and facilities will help to increase the level of the society health. On the contrary, other people believe that other activities should be use to up the quality of public health.
Building new facilities would have certain benefits and positive effects. Firstly, it could make a better condition for a lot of residents: they would have a lot of places where the will have an opportunity to take different classes near to their houses, consequanetely it can increase the number of people, who do some sport on regular bases. Secondly, it will also provide an chance to find a perfect kind of sport for every single citizen because of the accses to the variety of different sport location.
However, unfortunately, this kind of developing a new method can lead to zero effect. Firstly, even if goverment are able to build handieds of new sport centres, it will not change people's mind to try some healthy lifestyle, and it could bring only a disastrious money waste. Secondly, increasing the level of the people sport life can only be achieve by using a complex of different measures like populatization of healthy lifestyle through commercials and press, providing public health exerciseses and make agitation to attract more people into this new kind of life, that will be much better for them.
To conclude, I would like to say, that increasing the number of sport facilities is great option, but it will work only with the tight integration with other methods, because this kind of improvement had been already done before, and because of lack of the enthusiasm and information has failed.

There are a lot of international companies that help to employ workers in developing countries by moving their businesses to them, in modern world. As for me, such kind of help has as its own advantages as disadvantages. On the one hand, this development can really support poorer countries. Firstly, more and more people become employed that, secondly, rises standards of living and, therefore, makes this country’s economy function better and improve. Also this innovation can affect on other people’s desire to live in this country because it has become more perspective and better for living.  As for businessmen themselves it is a brilliant kind of marketing, especially PR, because they support those who need it, simply giving it to them in their country. It is important to note that the majority of people in poor countries can not afford themselves to live somewhere else abroad. On the other hand, there can appear some complications because of moving business abroad. The former thing is that there are always cultural differences between different nations, therefore it would be important to take into a count some cultural aspects such as not bringing a brand with some unpleasant symbols or words even. The former thing is competition. If particular company with a particular business direction took place somewhere in Africa, some African starting businessman would not have an opportunity to develop because his company  would end up badly, competing with an international company. To sum up, I would like to say that moving international business seems a really successful idea as for business helders and as for country-recipient, having more advantages than disadvantages.

The aim of my essay is to show some adventages for my point of view. 
If first of all, it is said that girls and boys have different views on life. So, having the same number of both genders in groups, students can expand their minds by chating with each other. 
Secondly, there are different ways of solving tasks. Some of them can be found only by males , another only by females. In this case, pupils in groups with equal numbers of men and women find out many new ways of dealing with different problems.
On the other hand, some people argue it is too hard too gather a group with the same number of students of both genders. They explain that it will be honest if someone do not enter a group only because it has already gathered all members with current gender. 
In conclusion, there is no doubt that gathering the group with equal males and females can be problematic. However, there more pros in such groups like the chance for pupils to expand their minds and to find out many new ways of coping with life problems.

On the one hand, male and female students should have fair opportunities of getting knowledge they need. Every subject should be available for any hardworking student. It is true that both genders have their strong sides at particular fields of education and there mustn’t be any barriers for entering the interesting sphere for a man or a woman.
On the other hand, some people suppose that there are some subjects where men are more likely to be successfull than women. For instance, the history gives us a lot of examples of man being talented in math subjects such as physics. Historically, woman were always better at house-keeping or cooking. They claim that woman in science is quite a modern trend. Personally, I don’t agree with this point of view.
To sum up, I would say that everyone should have equal chances of getting education. No matter what happened in the past there should be a fair opportunity for one who wants to study to be able to choose the branch they want to learn about. I agree that men and women have different talents and skills but there also should be a space for someone who has non-standard fields of interest. The modern system of education should be based on the principles of equality for both genders.

There are many discussions about the way of lifes and the way of health`s upgrading. So thus, the question “what is the best way to improve public health?” arise.
Undoubtedly, the growth of quantity of sports centers will be very acceptable. I could say that in modern world the importance of sports activities has an upward trend. People are interested in their body, figure and of course their health. For this aim big and medium-sized cities have a huge range of sports clubs. For example, government also maintain the sports programmes such as encouraging of Olimpic winners.
On the other hand there are a significant number of different measures which are needed to improve public health. For example, it would be a great idea about restriction of producing carbohydrats products. Also, the offering of fast-food restaurants will be declined because it leads to overweighting of population. Anothe way of improving health is using of ecological transport like a bicycle. Therefore, rhe environment would be a little better. And I think that a stress situation has a bad influence on people`s health. But it would be improved only by personal introspection. 
All in all, I`m totally agree that introducing of sporst facilities will increase a level of population`s health, but also if people will be combine a sport lifestyle with healthy food it would have a huge effect on the main target as a public health.

Why did the crime rates increase so sharply and who is responsidle for such behavior? In this essay I will provide some causes and solutions for this problem.

First of all, it is obvious that with the development of technologies and the Internet not only children became obsessed with it but also their parents. For this reason, they pay less attention to the upbringing and education. Children want to be recognised and want care and love, that is why they choose such radical ways to be in the center of attention. However, there is an easy solution for parents - simply to spend more time with their kids, to prove them their love and to be interested in the live of a child.

Secondly, the problem may be caused by school life and the relationships with teachers. At some schools students are not allowed to think and act independently, they are put into the straight borders. Phycologists believe that people of this age group are more likely to be sensitive and imposed to mood changes. If they are offended they let an anger to drive them. The possible solution for this is to give children more tasks and games connected with art, emotions, physical activity, focused on the improvement of critical thinking and self-confidence.

All things considered, never before had the children been so violent and likely to do illegal actions. People can argue infinetly about the causes but the one who cares about kids and loves them will never get an evil back.",65,2,1

Therefore, there is a trend to teach children foreign languages as sooner as possible. However, does it do more good than bad? In this essay it will be tried to discussed.
  First of all, knowing of foreign language is absolutely necessary nowadays. Sooner you will start to learn is better, because in childhood the memory is more flexible and more accomodative to foreign languages. So, it will be possible to learn and know more different languages and to be cosmopolitan. 
  However, in the early childhood, children are not very determined to learn. Given by the statistics in elementary school in Russian Federation in 2010, there are no significant success in learning foreign languages. The opposite situation is with elder schoolers, who show positive results in language education. Let’s don’t make too much pressure in little children. The learning of languages should be enjoyable.
  To crown it all, considering to opinions, learning language in the early childhood is rather fruitless.  So there would be much more profits for young people, when they start learning foreign languages in secondary school understanding what they are doing.
  As a result, nowadays is absolutely necessary to know foreign languages. It is valuable in education, business, tourist spheres. Hence, very young children usually have not significant success in learning foreign languages. So, there would be much more advantages, in my opinion, when children start learning foreign languages when they are a little mature and understand profits of learning foreign languages. Even so, so many men, so many minds.

The air travels are not the only way to transfer. All other types of transport developed actively, so people have an opportunity to choose it. For example, high speed trains can go through long distance faster, then a few years earlier. Moreover, such type of transport often is more comfortable and safe, so people can feel calm and peace in it. People with mental illnes like phobies are already feel it.

To my mind, this issue needs a thorough look and a serious tackle. In this essay, I will outline several reasons for this behaviour and suggest some possible solutions which can be taken.

What is more, during the development of the Internet, bigger amount of dangerous and violent information spreads by it. More young people nowadays have access to the global net so they see this cruelty and it influences their minds.
As for the solutions, teachers, for example, can organize additional lessons for those kids, whose parents are busy at work. They can also organize excursions, trips to the cinemas and theatres and other interesting activities. Parents, in their turn, should spend enough time to look after their children and be more attentive to their thoughts, mood and behaviour. Of course, it is their responsibility to give their children love and bring them up properly. Also they should put special filtres on home computers which avoid dangerous cites with an inappropriate content.
In conclusion, I can say that if the above mentionned solutions are implemented, the number of crimes committed by young people will decrease. It is very urgent issue and it is our responsibility to tackle it for the sake of our children and security of our society.",60,2,1

It can be seen, that metals and manufactured goods take the biggest part of all goods transported this way (35% and 25% respectively). Machinery, chemicals and food products have approximately the same percent of all goods, which are transported by rail, while non-metallic minerals is only about 6%
The second chart shows percentage of all goods transported by road. Manufactured goods and food products have 58% together, and also take the first place among all goods.

Some people believe that social media should be used for sharing useful information while other people argue that social media exist simply to have fun. In my essay I will discuss both points of view and provide my own opinion. A lot of people say that the initial purpose of social networks was to gain knowledge. They say that a person may use them for work, studying or self-education. For example, a person can be friend somebody from a different country and to know more about culture of that country. It is also easy to conduct a survey through social networks which might be helpful for students studying social science. Besides a person might also read some articles about politics, economic and another subject he’s interested in. at the same time, many people argue that social networks to be used for entertainment. A person educates himself in school or university and uses social media just to relax. For example, a person can play games or watch movies he loves. Social media also allow people to communicate with their friends and to make new friends all over the world. In conclusion, different people have different opinion. As for me, social media can be used for both education and entertainment. Sometimes I use social networks to search some useful information for my studying but I also use them to communicate with friends and have fun.

There are some pluses and some minuses to this topic. There are some advantages for companies to move to poorer countries. First of all, there are a lot of local people who need work. They agree to get job with little salary, so company can employ more peoply but pay them little money. For example, there are a lot of migrants in Saint-Petersburg and some building companies emply a lot of these people because they work hard but they do not need more money than a professional builder. Secondary, a good point is a transformation of developing country. If there are a lot of international companies in the country, there will be more investments, so the country will have more money. However, there are some disadvantages for this topic. Firstly,  people who have professional skills can not find the job. It caused very bug problems because a huge amount of workers become unemployment. Another minus is find in poorer countries it is easy to make money for companies but there is also a big competition between lots of them. Some companies become with no money and the percentage of unemployment is grow up. To sum up, it is better to move business to poorer countries because it is a good propose to give them a chance for better life. It can help them to become not so poor and decrease an amount of unemployment. For international companies it is also effective source to share new amount of their money.

As for me, of cause, it is not totally right, but I think people should not be strictly punished for copying without lisence.
Firstly not all people have enough money to efford a Bly-ray DVD, subscription to Netflex but they still want to watch movies and listen to music they like. I think that musicians and TV-produers should give an option to the person to pay money or not, because this way they will be more generous to their fans. The famous Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky publish his books with millions of copies and he gives an opportunity to download it from the Internet for free In one of his interview he said he wanted to let everybody to read it and the appreciation of this work is worth much more than money. Actually people still would buy a paper book after reading. Electronic version if they really liked it and enjoyed reading. The same thing with music if the song really touchs your soul most people prefer to pay for a high-quality song. So the are no need to punish people who let us to try some movies and music and then decide of we want it to buy 
Secondly, some educational movies should be avaliable to watch them for free, because forcing people to pay for basic knowledge of world leads to the uneducated nations and global problems – so at least Discovery and National Geographic programs should not take fee.
It’s not a secret for everybody that companies lose lots of money because of illegal sharings of their files but I don’t think it’s a crucial question for them So copywriters should not be punished for their actions.

For my opinion, musicians and film producers should be thankful to people, sharing theire products on the Internet, because they made for them a land of commercial. It is difficult not to agree, that in such industry doesn’t matter if it is music, film making, art or smth else, PR plays one of the main role, and of course, much more people can learn more about your work, your movies, music tracks and so on if it is free. 

For example, many years age I have watched the movie ‘Transpporting’ in the Internet and I loved it very much. This year then the second part of this movie appeared. I went on it to the cinema. May be, I will never watch this movie if I didn’t find it one day in the Internet, so, I wouldn’t go to the cinema and, at the result, the producer didn’t get money for it.

The same situation with music. If you hear good tracks in the Interne, you will go to the concert, and musicians also will get there money.

So, in the end, summurazing my essay, I would like to say that we live in the centery of information, and nowadays Internet is the main information source. That is why I don’t think, that sharing music and disks on the Internet should be punished.

And I also think, that art (becauise movies and music is a kind of art) shouldn’t be commercial, that is why the artists should share it with people.

There is still no universal answer for this question.
I do believe that illegal connection to the pirate content should be punished. Firstly, copying and sharing pirate copies undermine the right of intellectual ownership. It leads to money loss and a violation of basic right to have a property. The situation goes even worse if we will not forget the fact that such types of content (music and films) are produced directly by the authors. Secondly, due to the high popularity of illegal content then is a reduction of investitions in the music and films productions. Every project needs to be financed properly and there is no exception. It is highly unlikely to create something special if there will not a necessary material base Tonit. Thirdly, consumers should pay for music and films because there is a strong point in the understanding of a connection between a spending of your own money and consuming goods. There is no debate in the society whether people should pay for air tickets or not. Music and films are not usually associated with classic private goods and it has to be changed.
To summarize, there some somewhat strong arguments to the punishment of law violators. These actions are unjust, selfish and ineffective. They may lead to dramatic reduction of content’s quality. That would be a huge pity and a loss-loss situation.

Firstly, this essay will analyze the causes of this tendency and secondly, will propose some possible solutions to this problem.

To begin with, it is obvious that various kinds of mass media account for the increasing number of young culprits.The research shows that young people are particularly vulnerable and it leads to their psychological deformation as they imitate the behaviour of their favourite characters. The Internet and TV often propogate the temptuous image of criminals which is connected with a great number of merits, such as luxurious life and respect of other people. This shapes the wrong attitude of young people towards crime and its consequences and replaces the true values of humanism and hard labour. Moreover, deprived childhood and poor living conditions also contribute in the committing crimes. Young people often have limited opportunities and have to strive for any source of income to provide financial support for the family. Usually unemployment or lack of skills hinders their chances to earn for living. Consequently, this makes young people commit crimes.

Some urgent measures should be taken in order to tackle this problem. First of all, parents should eliminate any danger that comes from mass media. It is necessary to control the content of TV shows and serials and sometimes restrict the access to some sources. There are special controling programs which should be used by parents on a massive scale. What is more, it would be useful to organise special events in schools or universities in order to make young people reveal the adverse consequences of delinquent behaviour. For example, teachers can invite former criminals to share their negative experience and the outcome of committing crimes.

To sum up, the increase of crimes committed by young people is an alarming problem which requires complex measures in order to eradicate it.",70,2,0

To my mind, the main reason for such tendency is a freedom in Internet, where it is not very likely to find a censorship on most of the websites and also computer games.
To overcome this parent s can restrict the accept for children to the Internet. First of all, parents can pay money for the specialist, who will install parents control on the computer, so children would not have any opportunity to visit webpages with specific content. The positive effect from this is that the level of children aggression would really decline, since they would not be able to see violence and crimes. However, there is no guarantee that they would not be able to watch it in their friend’s house.
Moreover, schools can try to make children to understand the consequences of bad behavior. The idea is that schools should organize special lessons, where teachers will tell children about the rules and morality of our society. Children are the ones, who perceive information very well, so they would grow up with the knowledge of etalon behavior. On the other hand, this method can be not successful, since there is possibility of making the situation worse by constant reminding how to live.
All in all, I suppose, that the problem of youths crimes caused by violence is not going to be solved in nearly future because of the many aspects, though I think that the parents control is the most effective method today.",65,2,1

There is big difference in number of elder people (60+ years) between two countries: 3,6% in Yemen and 24,1% in Italy. Analysing projections for 2050 in Yemen it is possible to see dramatic increase in number of people 15-59 years old (11%). It will cause steep fall in number of children (13%). The amount of old people will raise steady. Projections in Italy show sharp increase in number of people 60+ years and noticable reduction of people 15-59 years old.

Young people behave against the law more than before and this issue shold be solved by their parents and others as soon as possible.

To begin with, the problem which makes teenagers comming crimes is the lack of money, for example thay can see that their clssmates are more invested than they are and they will try to be suitable for these particular group. In this case their parents should find suitable schools for them, where then wiil not feel miserable and consequently there will be no need to commite crimes.

The second reason why teens can act auwful is the bad surroundings, like friends or community where they are trying to express their personality. This sittuation is pretty common among the teen, who are trying to identify their personality. To avoid this cause teachers and parents should make some special talks about what consequences can follow you after you would be catched, showing them that the panishment is closer than they think.

Finally,acting against the law can be cause by simply game which is popular nowadays. Young people, for example, shoplift and then they count the price of the products and generate the winner. Solving this particular sittuation parents should try to save their children from this groups of teen, spending the laisure time of their childrent to the helpful activities like sport and other hobbies. Teen will have no free time to spend it on such stupid things. On top of that, parents should tell or show to what can prevent such activities.

To my mind, countries have to produce enough for their own population as well as for selling it abroad. It will defenetely improve economic situation in the country.

First of all, in the modern life a lot of developed countries achieve the stable economic situation by selling produced food to other countries. It must be admitted that the quality of all spheres in our life depend on the country’s economic situation.

Nowadays a lot of countries in the world can still be proud of their independence because of their export. For instance, countries like Peru and Venesuela are well-known by their fruits export to other countries. And it significantly benefits they economy.

Secondly, some countries are not able to produce enough food for their own population due to climate issues. Thus, countries like Russia and Canada have to buy import food from southern countries. To remain their economic situation stable these countries sell other goods like oil, wood etc.

It must be said that people who believe that countries should concentrate only on producing food for their own population think that it will make their life much easier. They will have to work less because they would produce food only for themselves.

To sum up, I am defenitely disagree with the given people opinion. I think, that import and export are crucial parts in countries economic. If the goverment wants to provide to their own population stable lifes they should not forget about import and export.

It is fault of competition with other corporations, expensive taxes in own country and cheap manufacture in poorer countries. Firstly, competitions in developed countries, especially in megapolices, can play a significant role in making lecission of moving businesses to developed countries. For example, a new owner of bakery couldn’t develop his brend in his city, because there are a lot of other companies, specialized in bakery shops too. That’s why this young owner move his business in poorer country with other culture. As a result, his brend “bakery” in a new country, for example, in China, would be a fresh wind for the local residents, who eat in everydaylife, such, rice and sugar and so on. Secondly, high taxes in big cities in modern countries could be extremely high. If company spends lots of money on taxes, money from the business would be really unsignificant. International companies move their business to poorer country, where they could pay less taxes and salary for local workers. Finally, manufacture in the developed country could be extremely expensive. However, in the developed countries it would be cheaper, because owner of companies could employ local worker and pay them low salaries without giving long weekends and vacation. In this case, a high name of brend doesn’t bring for local workers good qualification high and salary but such manufacture is really convenient for owners. Moreover, moving business to developing countries can bring to decrease of quality of goods. To sum it up, advantages of such development are profitable for owners at companies but it cause a dangerous  effect for local workers, because lots international corporations try to carry only about their income. All in all, there are a big number of companies’ owners, who really think about their worker, but it’s another story and point of view.

And while one way group of people including me agree with this statement, the other prefer to think that we can use better variants . first of all, it is the obvious fact that if people who broke the law more time in prison, they will not do again what they have people have done longer. For example, government look for killers and does not give them the chance to kill anyone. Another way why longer prison sentences is good is that many prisons give these people opportunity to help society while the are there. For instance, law breakers can clean streets, make clothes or cook. So, rising of prison sentence means that they will help us longer and with this they can return something for their bad things. On the other hand, if people have not done anything illegal but they have been charged by mistakes for someone, they will have to stay longer inside the prison because of the increasing sentences. In my opinion, we have to increase prison sentences, so peopled will pay for killing people or other illegal things that they have done. And thaks to that people will afraid to break the law because they will fear to waste so many time in prison. To conclude, if we will increase prison sentences we definitely reduce crime and help society more but some people who have not broke may suffer longer.

Of course, it may be new laws and also for all the genders and nationalities.A bigger amount of police also can help country to reduce more crime.

The most obvious problem that can be view amound the people is obeseness. The modern lifestyle allowa people to sit at home and work, order food, play games, etc, everything is available to stay at one place. So this passive live leads to the absence of activity and a person just starts to put on weight.

American citizens are famous for this kind of lifestyle and statistically it is the country with the highest rate of people with obeseness.

The other health problem is bad eyesight. We spend over time working, entertaining and chatting on the computer, smartphones and other modern gadgets.

One of them is that small local businesses are being replaced with large brands in many countries. This sutuation has some advantages and disadvantages, still I suppose that it is useful process for our society.
Firstly, I believe that large companies can help our national economy. In cities near the large supermarkets different developed places are located. For example, near the malls we can find a lot of entertainments, interesting activities, restaurants and parks. Therefore I can Surely say that large shops are expected to improve the local area.
The second advantage of large brands is the convinience for customers. From my point of view it is better to buy all the items in one place. People should not go to the different small shops and buy there two or three things, when they have the opportunity to go to the supermarket and find there the abundance of different things from different areas. Moreover it is cheaper for custumers, because they have no need to waste money on the road to different small shops and search there what they want to buy. Also people will save their time, which they can spend with their families, friends or they can spend it on doing their favourite hobbies. However, others suppose that the situation that small shops are being redundant now by large brends has some disandvantages. For example, people lose their small business and their jobs as well. It becomes difficult for them to find a new place for working, so they suffer from this .
To conclude, I should say that every social problem has its own benifits and drawbacks, but we always should find positive sides. I believe that this situation has more advantages than disadvantages. Large brands are really more convinient for modern society than small shops.",65,2,2

This problem been a controversial issue for many years as people became more concerned about the problem of air pollution. Two basic points of view will be considered in this essay further. To begin with, it should b said that nowadays the issue of air pollution is a vital problem for the whole population of the world as more countries develop their industry, many factory and spheres and so on. That is why people pay attention to air travel as the consequences for atmosphere are devastating. The matter is that law can b considered as one of the strongest means of influence the situation, while other mechanisms are not so effective. Moreover, the number of air travel is not likely to decrease by itself because it is a profitable sphere. So people have limited amount of resourses which can after the situation dramatically. In other words, only strict measures such as introducing laws can change it. However, there are those who disagree with this point of view. These group of people claim that such issue is insurmountable because of its characteristics. Firstly, some barriers such as law can stop the development of air travel business which can negatively affect on the further situation in the sphere. Secondly, in may be cases it will be an optimal measure for both sides. Two subjects (government and people or business) will not meet their needs. More precisely, people will be disappointed by the lack of number of air travel and business will loose a huge of profit. That is why the government may get another problem too. Taking all these points into consideration, I personally suppose that introducing laws to reduce the number of air travel for business is not an optimal measure which can make it better. The reason for such conclusion is that the consequences of these actions are even more harmful and dangerous then if we do nothing and leave the situation as it is. So our aim is to find new means of changing is to succeed.

I will try to explain why this happened and how parents and teachers can solve this problem.
First of all, i think the main problem is that young people have a lot of free time and instead of doing something useful they commit crimes, i think that happens because there is nothing to do in their cities and they tend to spend more time on the streets, which can be bad for them. Also, i thinks there are people who already criminals may be even their peers and they hang out together and their influence can easily lead to new crimes being done and even more criminals appearing on the streets.
Nevertheless, there are a couple of ways i can think of how this problem can be solved by teachers and parents. For example, teachers should make their subjects interesting for students so they would spend more time studying instead of just walking round the streets. What is more, teachers could start some extra classes like football by coach, or advanced chemistry by chemistry teacher that would fill all that time which is usually spend on the streets. Talking about parents i thinks they must pay more attention to their kids activities and who are their friends. That would reduce influence of those who are bad man. They can check who is in their kid's friend list in social networks in what activities they are involved because nowadays internet makes it really easy to control everyone.
All in all, I think this problem can be solved just by those who are spending a lot time with young people their professors and parents without police being involved.",70,2,0

Nowadays the problem is even more relevant than ever before, because governments are failing to tackle the problem via strong punishments and extra restrictions. That’s why the society should develop new approaches to the problem solution, based on positive influence of parents and teachers.
Let’s try to list the main reasons for crimes commited by children and teenagers and think how those crimes should be prevented. Some children might be engaged in stealing or robbery because they don’t have enough money to fulfill their needs and desires. Parents should definetely try to give their children an opportunity to earn their pocket money. Doing household chores or walking with a dog will not only bring a child a couple dollars but also teach him or her that money should be earned by labor.
Others might feel lack of understanding and love from their parents or classmates. Parents and teachers should talk to children, help them to build communication with other people. A person who is able to make true friends and who knows that he or she is surrounded by love and care is less likely to commit a crime.
The last reason which we will mention is permanent stress children and teens face in their everyday lives. Fear of flunking an exam, quarelling with parents might cause negative psychological effects and aggression finding its way out through violence and even crimes. Teachers should be very attentive to such students and provide them with a help of professional psychologist, if necessary. In other words, the best solution to problem doesn’t lie in the field of tough punishments and the strictest laws. We should try to smooth the process of socialization and growing instead. Being able to earn some money, make friends and having support in tough times will significantly decrease the incentives to break the law.

However, there is also a widespread  opinion that government must control their work. 
It goes without saying that artist people such as painters, writer, actors, have a very special view on the world. They create masterpieces on the basis of their talent and inspiration. Moreover, they are said to be very sensitive and their emotions and feelings shouldn't be affected by any restrictions otherwise they can lose their artist spark. 
However, a lot of people think differently. They say that art belongs tto the society, so itmust be controlled by its government. Furthermore, they believe that not all forms of art can be correctly understood by different people. That is why government should define what kind of art is acceptable. 
In my view, artistic people should not be influence by any outer circumstances. Firstly, their work cannot be compared with other material things. Secondly, governments should not influence the development of culture and put pressure on people who create it. 
In addition for example listening music is most  interesting habit to all clases of people. Apart from the negative side, artists can keep traditional culture by making attractive music on native culture. In this sense, they are the wealth of a notion. Many historical books are taught as an academic lesson in school and college. It artists have more freedom in terms of writing may be encouraged of their creativity in art fields. 
In conclusion, artistic world is really sensitive and if it is controlled by governments orany restrictions are made, they certainly should notruin inspiration and destroy the ideas of talented people.

Indeed, the 20th century totally changes the lifestyle of people, because there have been invented some unbelievable things like the Internet or a mobile phone. Nevertheless, the idea that people depend in gadgets and technology often sounds in the environment. 

So, such total interest to using technology can not stay unnoticed for people’s health. The first issue is that the modern style of life (with constant using of technology) contrihifies to ‘sitting’ style of life, because almost all modern gadgets have an aim to make life more simple and comfortable. Sometimes or two places with four walls start to be only areas of human’s life. This man does not need even walking, because the Internet broadens horizons and gives new experience. Gradually, a man can become too fat or stop to see well, besides such style of life affects on a heart, which become too weak, so a problem of a heart-attach starts to be real. People should understand that the natural rhytm of life must include workouts and sport, so even if a man has a job, connected with modern technology, he should be sporty.

Another problem of using technology is that the ability to live without them can reduce. Modern technology surrounds people since the childhood, consequently if a man is in any difficult problem, which obliges him to undertake a responsibility about own life, he can loose the control and he certanly not to survive.

For example, they have the right for freedom , for voting , for education and etc. However, they want more and more - in some countries women want to get as much places in government as men, or enforce universities to accept equal numbers of male and female students.
To my mind, the last position is not righ at all - it sounds like a feminism.
Firstly, I suppose that every person should has equal chances to be accepted in university or in school. And the decision of acceptance must be more on the basic of knowledge , not on the male of a student. I mean that only clear , hard-working and open-minded students should be accepted. And in this situation there are no differences between girls and boys - they are equal.
Secondly, not every subject is suitable for female students. For example, IT technology or engeneering are more suitable for boys then for girls. However, that doesn't mean that female students shouldn't be accepted for these courses - if they have enough knowledge and intention to study these subject why don't they be accepted?
Thus, there must be no borders between male and female students in question of acceptence in universities and it's better to give them equal chances and equal rights then woke these borders.

Some people think, that sportsmen, who take these illegal medicines, should be disqualificated for 2 years, while others suppose that these athletes should be out of sport for the whole their lives. I'm going to discuss both these ideas and give my opinion.
Firstly, athletes who use illegal drugs before competitions are not honest with other sportsmen, their opponents. Sport must be objective, there will be no scandals in it. That is why such ""not honest"" sportsmen will be punished by banning them from competing professionally for a limited period of 2 years. This disqualification is not so long, because some athletes do not know that there are some illegal drugs in their medicines. For example, Russian biathlonist Ekaterina Yurieva was shocked, when the World Biathlon Federation showed her doping results, they found some illegal drugs in her blood. So, the sportsman was disqualificated for 4 years and couldn't compete with other sportsmen.
On another hand, there are many examples, when the whole national teams use illegal drugs before championships and the Olimpic Games. In such case, sport federation of one country is not honest with sport federation of others and every sportsman of the national team should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives.
In my opinion, disqualification from the sport for the whole life is a very hard punishment, because for every athlete sport is his everything. I think, that disqualification for 2 years is a good punishment and it will teach sportsmen to be honest and do not use illegal drugs.

This may be caused by things like poverty, lack of education, physical and mental abuse, violent computer games, etc. This essay will discuss possible approaches for parents and teachers to be taken to solve this problem.
Firstly, the responsibility of raising the young generation lies with their parents. Making sure that their child is not involved in violent or abusive activities is crucial in this case. Parents should monitor the types of computer games their children play. Knowing who their child is friends with is also necessary, because peers often shape each other's mindsets, which sometimes results in seemingly quiet kids being involved in bullying or any kind of activities that include violence.
Secondly, since teachers are those who the children spend most of their days with, they are also participating in the forming of future generations. It is essential for teachers to crack down on anything that can provoke violence or be a cause of it inside the class. Becoming the child's friend and knowing their strengths and weaknesses would help them create a bond of love and respect, thus forming an individual that is law obeying and respectful to the other people.
Finally, both the parents and the teachers are the main role models for children, thereby being a lawful and considerate individual in the eyes of the child is essential.
In conclusion, it is the responsibility of the adults to solve the problem of growing rate of crime among young people. To be loving, caring and attentive to chidlren, to be a positive role model for them to look up to, are the best methods of solving this problem.",75,2,1

Personally, i stick to the idea that this activity can do much good to their followers and below i am to provide reasons expaining it.
To begin with, massive sport events can make different communities more close-nit. For instance, it is well-known that a lot families gather together each time a football or basketball match is on on TV, or a great example is the USA where lots of citizens make parties inviting their collegues and friends to watch socceer on TV at their homes. This all can basically mean that sport events embrace people.
Besides, watching sports in live gives people an invaluable opportunity to travel and make new friends. What is meant is that each sport event hosts thousands of people who sometimes travel long distances, overseas, to see their favourite sport team playing in live. In this respect, not only can they broaden their horizons by discovering a new country, but they are also very likely to meet people of different nations which is definitely a useful experience to have.
In conclusion, i should point out once again that watching sports on TV or participating in them as an observer can open new doors for self-development and entertainment. An additional example is that by doing this activity a person can develop critical thinking.",60,2,2

Therefore, some people hold the opinion that the government is able to ban some kinds of air transportation in order to reduce the amount of waste.
One of the most striking features of this problem is that air transportation is preferable among the residents. Althought, this kind of travelling is a great deal more convinient, the decline in it's popularity would cause some benefits for the envitonment. For instance, one could assume, that the atmosphere would contain less harmful emissions. Moreover, if the government intriduces a special law, the other types of transport should be also developed. In other words, people should get a good alternative to air transport, such as trains. As a result, people would be encouraged to use these ones.
One should nevertheless, consider the problem from another side. Despite the fact that the law might reduce the number of business and leisure air travellings, there are the other types of air transport usage. As a result, a chellenge of environmental polluting would not be completely solved. Furthermore, other kinds of activities such as automobiles or working of factories also influence the growth of harmful elements in the atmosphere, so, the law of the government would not change the situation completely.

Obviously in the field of tolerance to gender differences are still an enourmous amount of things to do. Women in the whole world are still struggling with gender discriminance. They are paid less than males, they often can not get a good job according to their gender and these are only a small list of difficulties, that every single woman has to face with in the modern world. Of course this unequality leads to different proportion between males and females in the universities. So there is an opinion that the cure from this problem is to forbid acception of different number males and females. Still it may not be the best solution.

Different faculties attracts males and females, for example men tend to choose some technical disciplines to study and women are more likely to choose something connected with cultural, society or humanity studies. But this tendency is not a rule. Sometimes people make another decissions but it is undoubtful that percentage of males and females in different faculties varies and the main cause is the will of students, not the stereotypes.

The second reason for different number of females and males is the physiological conditions. Males are bigger and stronger than females and it is ridiculous to deny it. So some proffessions connected with rising big weights are unappropriate for women so that it is understandable that some practical faculties are refusing to teach women. But in any theoretic discipline such situation would be discriminative.

According to all these aspects it should be noticed that despite the uneasy conditions, in which women are living today, sometimes the refuse to allow to work and study some activities for women is reasonable. It avoids unwanted harm for health and injuries. And still women and men tends to choose different fields of studies, so accepting the equal number of men and women in the universities is unnessecary.

There is an infinite number of problems that can play the role of incentives. In this essay I would like to discuss some of the ways that can help to overcome this development.
First of all, speaking about my personal judgment, the main cause of discussed problem is problems in families. Sometimes teenagers face domestic violence that can affect various aspects of their life and, as a result, they consider such behaviour as normal and act accordingly not only at home. Our parents are the ones who are the role models for us and if they do not behave appropriately, their children would think that they should also behave as them.
Secondly, the underlying cause of teenagers' acts against the law is some violent games among peers. It is a common trait of young people to try to be cooler than everyone else. Some of them are stealing clothes in order to be in trend and that noone would banter them because of their appearence.
Speaking about ways that can help to overcome this problem, firstly, it is essential for parents to understand their significant role in developing their childrens' charachers. Some lectures can be provided for those adults who have children where this problem will be discussed. What is more, teenagers spend most of their time in schools. Therefore, teachers can influence them too. It is vital for young people to know that they should not listen to their peers as they are not role models for them. So this topic can be discussed on some seminars. Thus, from the first grade they will be aware of some problems that can raise, as the result, of bad behaviour.
Taking everything into consideration, there are numerous reasons why teenagers are involved in the crimes. Despite of this fact, some tactics can be deployed in order to bypass this development.",70,2,0

Young boys and girls are being frequently acquired of committing robberies, attacks or even murders nowadays. Such horryfying trend force people, especially parents, to search for reason of this phenomenon and figure out methods of dealing with it.
In my opinion, causes of this problem can vary. Firstly, parents are using easier manners of home education, Moms and dads tend to grow up their children in a free atmosphere to let them think broader and develop themselves In the society. Sometimes it can lead yougsters to take after their weakly educated peers a even criminals which ends up in their own crime involvement. Secondly, the cause of youth crimikability may become the growing poverty among families in many countries. Lack of money is able to make people become criminals to earn their living.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to cope with this problem. Spending more time with one's child and trying to understand his youth problems may be one of the solutions. Parents spend much time working nowadays and it can lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding, between parents and kids. So, it should be fixed not to let children break lawl. What is more, comprehensive psychological support especially in schools can reduce the number of crimes by solving mental problems of growing persons. Of course, youngsters with their own problems may not be able to deal with them by themselves and protest through breaking the law.
To conclude, it is necessary to mention that the problem is extremely actual and up-to date. Leaving alone the dependance of this problem from the behaviour and attitude of parents and family, it is necassary to struggle the mental reasons of such social deviations.

The development of education in Africa, according to the chart, is not that fast, compared to South Asia, there is a slight change: 27,5% fall for boys (20 million to 14,5 million) and less than 50% for girls (23,7 million girls in 2000 to 18,2 in 2012).

There are many opinions on this topic, and both views should be considered.
Some people think that those who illegally use drugs to achieve higher results in such huge and important competitions as, for example, Olympic games have to be banned for their whole life. In their opinion it is absolutely unacceptable to have people with such reputation of cheaters on any country's team, when there has to be somebody else with same results reached with the help of natural abilities. That, as they believe, should seve as an example to those who consider ever cheating the rules of sport competitions.
On the other hand, however, there is another point of view. The other group of people holds on to the opinion that athletes should only be repelled for a specific period of time, which might be two or five years. To them it seems like a more sane decision, because even if an athlete used drugs, it might have been a good lesson to him, and he will not ever do it again because he learned it well. Also, sometimes claims of drug use can be fabricated, so the person accused might not even think of it, but would be sentenced anyway. There is a lot of politics involved, so it is not a rare case, therefore it is unfair to take somebody's dream away just by supposing that he has done something wrong.
I personally think that it would be more accurate to ban athletes for about two years to give them time to regroup and reflect on their future career. 
In conclusion, I have to say that everybody believes banning is necessary, although, different conditions should be stated by the low and applied to everybody; the amount of time for which an athlete should be banned can be extended if necessary.

Let's sink in on this topic and discover why is happiness is so difficult to find? Many psychologists says that true happiness  is unity of our lives and way to sucess that we dream of. If they are together you will be in good state of mind. 
Example for that statement is research of the Canadian lifestyle-coach Todd Benkerstone. He tested 25 richest men of Canada and interviewed them. All off them said that work and business, in their opinion, is fun and simple. They havea lways dreamed of having business and when they buit one it gave them a lot of happiness.
Why happiness is so difficult to define by ordinairy people? it is simple: We do not know what to do with our lives. Great french writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called is ""existentional crisis"". Sartre said that this crisis is the main root of our happiness and oven health problems.In my life I also was corrupted by thi horrible feeling, but my family, teachers and friends bring me to life and show me path that I'm going on at the moment.
What is important to do to achieve true happiness? You should undertand what are you dream of, after that set goals to achieve and start to move on this life-path. My ""panacea"" to contradict unhappiness is meditation and yoga. Eastern techniques cures many mind traumas and heals the soul of person who used itb Philosophy and religion is also may be a good choice to achieving happiness. Why? They set goals to us and smoothy forces us to move on, to achieve it.
To conclude the essay I should say that no matter taht we live in fast, sometimes cruel world. For true happiness we should stay for a moment and asked to themselves: ""Why am I here?"". The answer of that question is the our personal path. There is no two similar fingerprints. And, finally, journey on this path brings us a lot of love, friendship, new emotions, fun and, as a result, true happiness.

This sum will not depend on any other income you receive and will be the same for everyone. However, can advantages of this system outweigh the disadvantages?
In my opinion, such system has more disadvantages that advantages for two reasons. Firstly, this system will not lead to significant changes in lives of middle-class and upper-class. For example, people who earned a lot of money from elsewhere will continue to earn their money, but this system will just give them an additional income. Other people, who do not earn much money, will also have an additional income, but this will not change their position in the society. We can see that the situation will remain the same for ordinary people, but the rich will get richer. In addition to this argument, it is obvious that prices will grow with the introducing of this system, so it will not make people’s lives much better, but will just spend government’s money.
Secondly, this system can damage the interest in finding a job. If people earn money doing nothing, why should they work? This problem will definitely occur with this system. The level of unemployment will grow dramatically but the main problem will be that people will become too lazy to work and will not be willing to find a job. This will damage the economy.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this system may have some advantages as it gives people more income and makes their lives a bit better. However, its drawbacks will bring more problems than advantages benefits.",70,2,4

But who can give the right definition to the word “happiness”?
In my point of view, nobody can suggest it for some reasons.
To beging with, this term “happiness” is difficult to define because people have different opinion about how to become happy. For example, some of us want to have a lot of money and power. However, others prefer think more about health of their relatives and friend. Thus, we all have differents priorities in our live, to my mind, it forms our percieve about happiness.
What about factors, which is important in becoming happy. As far as I am concerned, that people should follow the phrase: “Do what you like. Like what you do.” It means that we ought to chose our way in life taking into account our interestst because you cannot be happy if you do not like your job. Secondly, if you want achieve something you should do the best for it. To my mind, laziness kills happiness. Another factor is the support because people who have close friends with whom they can talk about problems, they are able to do everything. Friends give some advice and help when you need it. In my point of view, if a person have friends, he or she is lucky and happy.
To sum up, I strongly believe that people define the word “happiness” different, however, all of us should to feel support to achieve what we want in life and to become happy.

There are some advantages of this idea and because of them many people support it. In my opinion, the y do not outweigh disadvantages of this organizational principles. To begin with, replacing manufactures to poorer countries seems to be a good idea to companies and consumers. Firstly, labour in that countries is cheaper than in developed ones, therefore products made there is cheaper too. Lower costs attract people strongly and they buy products from Asia and Africa realized under the famous European or American brands. Moreover, building factories in developing countries gives them a chance to develop faster. For example, Bangladesh or Vietnam have increased their GDPs rapidly after the opening of some factories by European companies there finally, any new manufactures placed in a foreign country makes these countries closer, economic cooperation supports the idea of world united by all types of communication which brings all countries new opportunities to develop. On the other hand, I am sure that all mentioned advantages have got the opposite side. First of all, replacement of manufacturing into a country with cheaper labour kills local markets in developed areas and causes unemployment. Companies do not want to pay more to qualified European or American specialists and prefer cheaper substitutes in other countries. By those decisions, many people have to change their specialisations.  What is more important, this system makes poorer countries dependent on the richer ones, because of economical internetion made by their companies. After that a developing country might develop only a certain way suggested by factories’ owner. Finally, the replacement actually does not make the world community closer but divides all countries into two big groups – producing and selling. It is clear that this situation might lead to a number of problems. To sum up, there are some advantages of many companies’ decision to replace their factories in developing countries but I think that it’s disadvantages are equal. World business community has to find the balance solving this problem and it will give an opportunity to develop economies of all countries.

In spite of this, other people suggest that there is no point for developing this side of issue.
It is obvious that sport plays significant role in health of people. Average person should does some sports regularly, if he/she want to stay fit and healthy. Some people are not able to do some sports because there are just a few sport centres in the area, where they live, moreover, this gyms can be very expensive. If government provide a big number of sport facilities, people will have more opportunities to improve their health by doing some sports. As we know, sport can normilise blood pressure; help your heart work and prevent the development of obesity.
Despite these facts, some people think that creating more sports centres will not be enough for health improvement of huge numbers of people. Other ways of solving the problem should be invented or devised. Creation of sport facilities does not automatically foster the people to do sports. in modern reality people sometimes do not have time to attend gym or swimming pool Moreover, people can bring harm to their health by eating unhealthy food, drinkink alcohol and spending long hours behind the computer screens. That means that some measures should be implemented in that direction. And some kind of healthy way of life propaganda should be done.
In conclusion, I want to say that increasing the number of sport facilities has positive impact on peoples health only in case of co-working with other measures, which should be brought. Overall, some steps should be done towards the awarness of people about their health and way of life.

So, the main question in this problem is how to punish this criminals.
First off all, the way of thinking of many people is like that: criminals must be in prison for a long time. From my point of view, it is a good solution of the problem because these people won't do other bad actions in future. However, I think, that it is not nesseccary to make good conditions in the prison becausee there are people who killed and robed. They are not pay attention to the law, so we need not pay attention to their conditionals.
From the other hand, there is alternative way of punishment: it is reabilitation. People in prison have very good conditionals, for example, clean bath and own toillet, book shelf and tabel, TV and soft bad. This way of reabilitation is good for people who want to change their life. In prison they can work and after a few years they become a normal people. In my opinion, it is a strange way of punishment due to this conditions. It is look like that they are not in prison but they are in theit normal life, where they can walking, working, watching TV and enjoing their life style.
In conclusin, the best way of punishement, I think, is being in prison for a long time. Although, alternative way is exist: it is reabilitation, but it is too ""soft"" for criminals.",60,2,2

Universities is not the expetion and the following suggestion is offered: should Universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Personally I’m of the opinion that it is not necessary to pay so much attention to this sharing.
Firstly, not all students are interested in some subject identically. For instance, the amount of female students in the sphere of literary, foreign languages or journalistic is always higher than the percent of male students. I study filology and there are nearly 35 female students and only 3 male students on my faculty.
Secondly, there is not always the opportunity to share female and male students properly. It often depends on the demografic situation in the country. For instance, in Russia, where I live and study, there are much more women than men, so the problem of equal numbers of male and female students can not be decided.
Moreover, there is the coherence between the level of intellect and sex. It’s well known that it’s too hard for female to deal with any electronical or ingineering sphere. This fact also illustrates the big amount of men, who work with modern innovations and nucklear research. So, has it any sense to share male and female students in the same proportion?
To sum up it can be said that the question of sex is too actual and there is not one proper answer or it’s too hard to find it. However, in some cases, for instance, in case of universities, we should not exaggerate the impact of feminism and emancipation and should not pay so much attention to the male and female rights.

The first thing to speak about is that the living rates in Yemen are relatively low, which is represented by 3 and 5 percent of those who are above 60 in the years 2000 and 2050 respectively. We have another situation in Italy: the number of those, who are above 60 is expected to almost double. The number of growh-ups in Yemen is expected to shorten from approximately half of population down to nearly 37 percent.

It is very comfortable and really fast: with the help of air travel you can achieve your final destination in shorter period than you could do it about 100 years ago. But there is the other side of air travelling. Planes produce the pollution of the air and many other deseases like warming atmosphere. That is wht some scientists say that we need some rules introduced by government, which are connected with the airtravel in different purposes.
As for me, I think that global warming is one of the most important problems for humanity in the 21st century. Firstly, there are so huge amount of risks for people's health and lifes connected with the result of the global warming. For example, it is not a secret that global warming contributes such changes as coast lines movings and climate changes. So, as the airplanes have significant impact on this factor, governments should decline this risks by creating new laws for air companies and people who travel a lot. In my opinion, it will be very useful if our government install some amount brouds for travelers.
What is more, everyone knows that airports are never situated in the cities, but near them. One of the main reasons of this is that negative effect of airplanes is still one of the common dangers mentioned by specialists. Providing air pollution, air travelling should be more reasonable, I think. However, governments should be alarmed by this danger for people, animals and plants. It is in competention of governments to decline negative effect of air travelling by producing special laws to control air travelling.
In conclusion, I would like to underline that travelling by planes has it's dangerous effect on our health, for example, get lags make us feel bored and tired and crushes our biological watches. So, new rules and laws introduced by government are really needed today.

However, there is a problem of global warming and air planes also have got a bad influence on this fact. The question is what the governments should to do. I am concerned that the governments should regulate this sphere but not by reduction the amount of air travel for business and leisure. As for me, it could be more ecological fuel or other ways to make the bad influence of air transport the least. So from my point of view, it is impossible to cut the number of flights in modern life. People are addicted to their time. It is impossible for business men or politics to spend more days to achieve another country – moreover, it takes lots of money and time to make a special infrastructure for travelling without air planes such as terminals, roads and other once. It is much more realistic to spend this money on science and create more ecological fuel that helps to avoid bad results of global warming without reduction the amount of flights. It is realistic because such researches take place today, for example, cars became more and more ecological every year so I believe that air planes are not the exceptions and it is also realistic. Overall, I am agree with the fact of the problem of air pollution by air planes but I tend to think that the most realistic way of solution is making legislation about quality of fuel, not about the amount of air travel for business and leisure.

The most popular social networks are Vkontakte and Facebook. Some people think that this kind of social media should be used for sharing the information and knowledge, while others truly believe that they were created only for entertainment. This essay will look at the both sides of the argument. First of all, social networks were made to contribute spreading the ideas all around the world. The main thing that Facebook and Vkontakte give is communication. It helps many people to socialize and being social outcast. From this point of view, it is adequate. However, some people indulge in a vitual life so much that they start forgetting about their real life and especially about their self-development. They waste their time and do nothing beneficial. Secondly, social media definitely should give us knowledge and information, it is evidely known that there social networks provide people with a billion of pictures, videos, different facts and so on, but these knowledge are not entirely seintific. These knowledge won’t help you in your education or to get a degree. But still, if we are considering self-development, it’s an efficient way of getting information. So social networks give us some knowledge, but it after happens in terms of the entertainment, to these two points are closely connected. On the other hand, social media shouldn’t give us any information and we shouldn’t learn via the Internet and there is a reason for it. It is certainly clear, that the information that the internet provides is not very reliable. We always have to double cheak it. That is why if you want to educate, to develop yourself, you should use more reliable sources. However, sometimes the infroamtion is pretty reliable but it is rather an exception. In conclusion, social media I should provide us both with the entertainment and with knowledge, so that we will know that we are not only entertaining ourselves, but also developing and becoming smarter.

Nowadays the situation in the universities shows that not every speciality can accept equal parts of male and female students. This topic is worth to discussion.
On the hand, I partly agree with that because of its ambiguity. Technical universities attract mostly male applicants and than students. The humanity specialities have mostly female one. It is obvious that such a situation should be because male students are interested in practical education and female students in female practical skills, for example, literary, painting, history, languages.
On the other hand, I can hardly agree with such a position. Most of teachers, for instance, who teach literary studies are male ones. Moreover, there are a lot of female researchers in physics, maths and other “male” specialities. For this reason the universities can accept numbers of different students, who want to be taught by these skills.
In conclusion I would like to notice that it is not important, which population is leading on which speciality. I think if student has a great interest in different studies, the universities should explain them that and give this opportunity. Another reason is that the government wants thaeir stidents to part in equal proportion in every subject necause of wish to have equal numbers of specialists in every subject. This reason can be but I prefer another one which is to do what students want. In another words such a theme is very popular and actual in recent years.

More and more illegal affairs are commited by youngsters every day. What actions can people take to reduce the crime rate? In this essay I will discuss some causes and possible solutions.

There is no doubt that there are different causes of this problem. However, the first one is the lack of different activity among young people. Unfortunately, they have too much spair time and nothing to do with it.The second problem is in the sphere of mass media. Nowadays, a lot of films and social networks propogate such cruel lifestyle and make it fashionable to be a ""bad boy"".Another reason may be connected with drug addiction which is very common for this generation. That means when people have no money for drugs they begin to search these money by all possible ways and the easiest one is to commit a crime.

Beyond all doubts, the first thing that parents and teachers can do is to involve their children and pupils in different activities like sports, music,art and so on, in that way they will not have enough time even to think about the crime. Secondly, parents should check periodically the interests of their children and not aloud to watch too cruel movies in very young age. Finally, the problem of drugs is the most serious one, so children should have regular chekups in the hospital and they should be awared by parents and teachers how dangerous for life such addiction can be.

To sum it up, the main reason for commiting a crime seems to be the lack of attention to children from parents and teachers. People grown up in love are less involved in the illegal actions.",65,2,0

It is argued that contestants that were proven to consume illegal drugs should not ever be allowed to participate in competition while another point of view suggests that penalty shouldn't be so strict and should last only several years. This essay will overview both opinions and make a conclusion.
Some people believe that sportsmen that were caught cheating once would continue to use steroids and other means of increasing their physical possibilities even after few year of disqualification. Sadly, sport industry has know such cases. First places at professional competitions bring loads of money, and that is the reason why athlets continue to commit crimes. Banning unfair stars could open a way to young and ambitious people who could be more interested in honest competition.
The opposite argument is that disqualification shouldn't be permanent. Certainly, cheating is a serious crime but does is really deserves such punishment? Professional athlets put all their lives to achieve success, and all their aspirations are connected with sport triumphs. They often can't do anything else except their profession, so leaving a career forever might mean an end to all their perspectives. The other point is that any separete disqualifications. no matter how long they are don't solve the whole problem of illegal drugs use. Much more serious sleps shoud be taken to cope with such issue, the whole system should be overlooked and reformed.
To sum up, drugs use in sport remains a serious problem. life-long penalty has some minor benefits but it doesn't change the whole situation. Neither does short ban for two years although permanent ban could keep more competitors from unfair game.

That point of view is sane, and I mostly agree with this meaning, but only with some remarks.

First of my arguments is that producing is usually cheaper than buying so it is good for economics not to import food, but make it. The government that is not buying expensive food from another countries can spend the money for enhansing the level of people’s life or improving scientific researches.

Secondly, in case of conflict with countries exporting food, the importing country will have a deficite. People will lose some of their favourite product because of shopping the import. But if the country is not buying food, but making it, a deficit will not happen. And it is not just about food, but firstly it is medicine and weapon.

However, there is one problem that lies in possibilities. Countries just can not produce every kind of food on their own. Sometimes the climate or another things just forbid to produce food. For example, it is impossible to grow bananas or pineapples in cold north countries. I think we should nesessary mention it, because if we do not import some rare kinds of food, then people start to miss it and become unhappy.

In conclusion, I want to say that it is not true to provide radical meanings as complete avoiding an import.

So, talking about N.Africa, we should say, that the percent of unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 didn’t change and was the same – 12,5. In Middle East in 2014 the percent of unemployment rate was on several percent higher, than in 2015. Talking about EU, we should say, that the number has rised from 7,5 to 7,9 percent during the period from 2014 till 2015. In Latin America the number of unemployment rate has fell from 6,8 to 5,8 during the period from 2014 till 2015. 

In South Asia the number didn’t change on this period. The same situation in World wide – the percent was the same, but a bit higher then in South Asia – 5,9.

So, summarising this information, we can say, that the highest percent of unemployments in both years is in N.Africa and the lowest percent of unemployments is in South Asia.

I see both advantages and disadvantages in this type of activity, like improving the neighbourhood and working for a charity.
First of all, let’s talk about advantages of being the unpaid community service a compulsory part of high school programmes. I believe, that charity activity and helping and teaching to youngers can teach olders what it feels to be kind for others, can show us what we can better than we already are, and also what we can make our world better and much more beautifull together. It’s really awesome I think, so if this initiative used properly it defenitely should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. 
And which is lead us to another side of coin. As all we know, we live in beautiful country, but still we have a huge amount of fools. Some people can not understand this initiative properly and can make wrong decisions based on it. Some of students in high schools just can’t spend extra time helping the youngers in reason of hard exam preparation. They should study hard if they want to gain good marks on exam and go to the university which they choosed. So if charity activity become “must to do” they have great chance to lose marks on the exam.
So, in my opinion, this initiative can be one of the best ideas for our high school, but just if used properly and didn’t make students lose their marks.

First of all, it is seen that in the period from 1940 to 1960 both America and Sweden population of people who 65 and more gradually increased almost on the same level while in Japan there was a slight decrease. Than amount of such people in the USA sharply rised up to 15% and then levelled off till 2020. In 1990 there was a significant increase of old population in Sweden from 13 to 20% in 2018. Japan proportion of population remained stable from 1960 to 1987 and then steeply went up to 10% in 2028.

It is N. Africa and S. Asia. Although in the rest regions the rates changed, the worldwide unemployment rate was still 5,9 percent in 2015.
Also it can be mentioned that the ranking of regions has not changed in 2015 because there were only slight hesitations of the rates. For example, in the EU the level increased only by 0.4 percent while in the Middle East and Latin America the percentage of unemployed people decreased by 1.4 and 1 percent accordingly.

First of all, this process does not allow the small companies to exist or to work properly. Obviously, It is immensely challeging to create a local business, because the bigger companies have much more opprtunities and as usual destroy small ones.Therefore, there are less and less those who want to star their own local business.
this prosess dimolishs the all opportunities to do it. Neverthe less, the goverments provides special policy to protect local business so they can not disappear at all.
On the other hand, the development of large, multinational brand provides really wide range of products.
Moreover, it's hardly feasible to imagine that something that you bought in that company is not made by high-qualified workers because it has really amasing quantity. So if large companies stop working, dozens o humans will be without really wonderful, fasionable and well-maked products.

Lots of sportsmen were caught using them and lost the chance to come back to professional sport. This caused great discussions all over the world. There are other points of view that will be reflected in this essay.
One one hand, drugs are prohibited almost everywhere and nobody can make or use it or he/she will be judged and go to prison. Sportsmen are not unusuall and outstanding people who are allowed to take them. So, the one who did it should not only be banned from competing professionally but even be judged. It is an illegal action that should be punished. And the best punishment for a sportsman is a banning from all the competitions for the rest of his/her life.
On the other hand, everyone should have a chance to make himself better, to recognize mistakes and do all his best to improve it. If there is an opportunity that if a sportsman was banned, he would not repeat such actions anymore. Hence, the punishment for two years without professional competitions would be fair. For example, I know a tennis player who was caught using illegal drugs and she was banned for 1 year. Since that time she has never used drugs and even joined anti-drug club in Moscow.
Although many people believe, that the use of illegal drugs is illegal action, I suppose that everyone could do something wrong and schould be forgiven at first time. The feeling of compassion is a Christian value but it is worth following by any person.
To conclude, it is essential to say that the issue of drugs in professional sport is a problem, the government and sport comitees tackle with but it hasn't been solved yet. People should evocate more time for its solution and try to find the right choice.

The question is whether it is a cure for some urgent problem or blossom. To my mind there is no nessecity in such a change.
The first reason is that current attendency system is enough liberalised. That means there is no gender, racial or other social barriers while younger people attend any University, that would make the abilities to get a higher education shrinked or abolished for some groups.
The second reason is that equaling the numbers correlates with the fairness of getting the higher education in noway. While the rights of each gender group will be formaly the same, factually that will break the rights of the others that were not accepted for the reasons they were unable to change or choose.
The last reason that must be stated is that in some subjects there is a low percentage of male or female students traditionally. That tradition is not even based on abilities or disabilities of each gender but some social patterns. Some natural or technic sciencies are dominated but the males on a 20:1 ratio , while on some school teaching studies faculties there are no males at all.
To conclude, equaling does not alwayes tied with fairness. Some mechanic equaling may not respond adequaly to some issues especially when we are talking about human choice in their future, but the main reason can be avoiding unnessecary obstickles on the pooth of peoples' choice.

I support this point of view and I see several reasons for that.

Firsly, Britain and American films are trendy. They predominate in different areas such as arts, fashion, music as well as film industry. The films that were produced in the Hollywood became the examples for others. Many brand-new ideas, plots and characters were introduced here at the first time. Moreover, local directors often copy plots and characters from the foreign movies. Hence, people do not want to watch the movies that are copied from the films they have already seen.

Secondly, directors in Britain and the USA are given more financial support. They have more opportunities for expensive special effects, stundmen, equipment and further graphic proceeding. So, many people think that these films are more vivid and stunning.

On the other hand, this point of view is not completely true. There are many Europian films that are loved all over the world, especially French ones. Maybe they are not so popular as American movies, but people enjoy watching them too.

As for financial support, I consider government should invest some money to the local film industries. First of all, some of these industries are unique, for instance, the cartoon studios in Russia. They earn not so much money selling tickets and their cartoons, but not because they are unpopular. People watch them on the Internet and do not pay money for it. Moreover, there are many talanted young actors who cannot work in the film industry - they cannot earn there enough money for living. So, they need some financial support to continue their work.

In conclusion I would like to say that British and American films are more preferred in the world because they establish the fashion and trends. Someti in the movie industry. Sometimes they are significantly better than other films, but the reasons for it may vary quite a lot.",65,2,3

But there is a question if they should be punished.
It is obivous that people, who earn money from legal products, want people, who download or share pirate copies to be punished, as it’s illegal. Every country has speacial laws to protect authors from stealing their works.
To my mind, there should be such prohibitions only on works, which author is alive, because there a lot of companies who have the author rights to works of dead people, and they forbid to share the music or books even if the author wasn’t mad at such sharing. Sharing books can rise the level of education of people, and this is one of the proses of pirates.
Nowdays there are a lot of web sites, where you can watch films legaly, but you have to watch the advertisment first. The advert brings huge money, so the authors can earn money. In my opinion such way is the most appropriate to develop industry of music or cinema. Those want to watch a film or listen to music shouldn’t pay money for it. Art should be free.
I also disagree with the opinion tha producers lose a huge money because of the pirates. There are always someone who wants to buy a legal product so they spend money for it. Othervise someone just don’t have money for such entertainment, so they use pirat copies. But the money, which producers get from their popular works are always huge.

It is a bad tendency and people should think what can be done with this increasing persantage. In this essay I will write some causes of this development and give solutions for overcomming them to parents and teachers.
First of all, many youngsters are trying to show their independency. They start to shout at parents, not to go to schools and so on, because they think that it ia a right way of independant living. Moreover, they star to committ some small crimes like poket lifting or shop robbery. I suppose that parents should speak with their children to stop this drammatic behaviour. They should clearly say what is right and what is wrong to do. Moreover, they can look after children more clearly to prevent some crimes.
Secondly, many yongsters can be influenced by gangsters in films. They watch them and become to do everything to be similar to the heroes of the crime films of 90th. So, as a result they committ some crimes. For solving this I suppose that parents should show only kind films to children since the early ages. When the child grows up, they want to watch only films which have some sence and which let them thinking after watching it. It will become their behaviour which was made by parents in childhood.
The last but not the least cause of this problem is some bad peers of children who do not have parents or their mothers are drug or alhogol addicted. As a result of the communacation with the friends like that, children become to be like them. They want to be a part of the team of that bad peers, so they do all like they. Furthermore, not only crimes are dangerous for them in this society. They also can start to dring alhogol or to take drugs since the early age of 15 or 16. To overcome and stop this trend, parents and techers should speak with children everyday. They should tell them all concequances of their bad deeds. Moreover, the important solution for preventing the communacation with bad peers can be the moving to some other town. So, choldren will try to start new life in new place.
To sum up I would like to say, that there are many solutions for overcoming this problem, but first of all, adults should understant the main reason why their children have committed the crime.",70,2,4

I absolutely agree with this statement.

First of all, every writer, singer, actor and other content maker tries to create a unique product. And the official release of this product is pivotal pare of the process for the author. I am convinced that every work should has its award. But people who share illegal copies do not understand this. Consequently, musicians and film producers suffer huge losses from this illegal actions.

Secondly, I think that distribution of pirate copies can hurm the author. For example, fans of Twilight saga hacked computer of the author, Stephanie Mayer and and shared in the Internet her book. But the book was not been finished. And Stephanie decided to stop working with it. Fans made pleas and asked her to finish but she was really sad.

There are people who say that the Internet is an open space and nowadays we do not need to pay, for music and films. But they should know that there are many websites where users can find and download content for money. It means that internet pirates share for money music and films that they did not produce. I think it is illegal actions and for this theft they can be arrested.

All things considered, I want to say that sharing of illegal pirate copies in the Internet must be stopped. People must pay for music and films, because it is the result of someone's work that should have a money award.

This is not only about charity, politics, medicine or surviving and overcoming environmental disasters, but also about business. Some people claim that the strategy of opening new branches of well-known highly-influential companies in developing and third-world countries is one of the best ways to fight against unemployment, whereas others assume this method to be rather useless. I share the first opinion.    There are some arguments supporting my point of view. First of all, by giving an opportunity of such employment to local workers is actually a whole cluster of decisions, as with this chance people may also receive extra education for their occupation and other perks such as health insurance, which is especially important for them. Moreover, extention to poorer countries usually creates lots of blue collar offers, not only white collar once, which would have more interest in such countries, as it's often factories that's being constructed and opened in developing states.    However, there are those complaining about this strategy being a complete non-sence. They believe that such development may bring managing problems because such programmes are usually performed in remote places. And that distance, as supposed, has its effect on the final cost of the outcome product, which is a result of higher logistic expenses. Still, from my point of view those extra payments don't play a big role in the final cost. That is because labour in developing countries is way cheaper than in developed once, which means that an outcome is practically the same. As a result, it is not only the citizens who benefit from such programmes, but also the companies themselves. Taking everything into consideration, the advantages of such trends are quite obvious and are above any arguments. It is unquestionable that everybody gets the best from these deals, so why not turning a rare practice into a common practice full of benefits for both sides?",70,2,2

A person may doubt and question the assumption whether the advantages outweigh the backwards. To give my own opinion I would like to consider this issue providing some arguments for and against the project.
To begin with, In case the system is not overseen and prepared profoundly, it may lead to severe consequences. It is necessary to create a particular part of country’s budget from which people will be paid. As a result, the government has to reduce or even discontinue the financial support for some important spheres of life such as military or poor population support. To prevent this, the government should raise taxes which are not likely to be approved by people.
On the other hand, receiving a guaranteed sum of money every month enables to have lots of opportunities. Indeed, for most fractions of the society this system can become a good support and base in some struggling situations in life that are common nowadays. For example, because of economic problems a person gets fired from job but still has his or her fixed income which will probably allow them to start up or at least live normally until they find a proper job. In conclusion, having considered this subject and both advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of such a system will outweigh the backwards as it is a perfect social support program.",70,2,2

For instance, metals contain more than a third in a whole delivered goods by rail, whereas it's share in road transportation is thrice less. To continue with, the pattern is reversed for the delivery of food by these 2 means of transport. For example, the amount of grocery, transported by the road, is thrice as high, as transported by rail.

Firstly, it is a good idea to move some business from developed countries to the places are not so developed yet because this action can become a force on the way of development and well-being of the country. For instance, if in the area there are not so many work places, the international companies will employ local workers. Maybe, this decision will safe people from the death and help them to deal with unemployment. But on the other hand there are some disadvantages.

In my opinion, I think that there should be punishments for online piracy; the punishment should be lowered base on the types of content. 

Although online piracy is contributed to many financial problems as well as human brain draing, I think that it should be considered as heavy crime and punishments can be djusted. Firstly, sharing is one of the humanity’s basic instinct. It is inevitable because of the internet. Beside new-released contents there are alse countries contents that are created long time age. Personal speaking, I think the old music or movies are not wothly to pay to savor, but they are too old compared to those newly released. Not all the Internat’s contents should have copyrights, but sometimes some of them should and for that, raising people’s awareness regarding to how, the piracy can cause the author of the writer of the song and why they should use copyrighted productions. Furthermore, people don’t even know how they will damge the author of they use piracy contents, so raising the awnereness.

Such movement have benefit but some people think oppositly. The first advantage of movement business to the developing countries is the opportunity for native people to get a jb with good salary. The second benefits is that companies decrease the investment in manufacture what do the prices of goods lower. For example people all over the world use the things that was made in China and it is not the secret that such goods re much cheaper than others. The next good point of the movement is the creating a better quality of life to the people of developing countries. At the same tie there are a number of reasons why the movement of business is not good idea. First of all, the poor quality of products that can be broken easily. The second reason is the bad influence on the environment/ big factories do unpredictable harm to the atmosphere of our planet. Next problem that connected with the business in poor countries is the creating places for the building of factories. They cut the forests, polute the soil, the huge part of the land become useless and damaged.

In general, we bye something cheap but after the year of using if we should bye the same good again.

A great number of innovations have made our life much easier. However, some people are sure that technology can influence badly on people's health and cause some illnesses.
Firstly, they say that using computers is very harmful for people's eyes. Statisticians report that the number of blind people has increased in past few years and in their opinion correlation is obvious. This problem is especially crucial when children are analyzed. More than a half of population under 10 years in some countries suffer from problems with their eyes. Secondly, some technological innovations can harm ecology, so the water will become polluted and potentially harmful; Undoubtedly, use of polluted water can cause many infections. Thirdly, some people have fears that technology can cause problems with mental health. For example, when a person plays in a scary game using VR-glasses, he can be harmed by heart attack as the picture is too realistic.
These concerns are taken seriously by the society, so the government try to deal with these problems. Speaking about problems with eyes, it is important to mention that governments encourage producers to make screens which won't be harmful for eyes. Many subsidies are given monthly and it is believed that situation will be taken under control soon. Government's measures are effective in dealing with ecological problems too. For example, Chinese government has made special restrictions which banned those factories, which caused too much pollution. Now the situation in China is much better. Finally, nowadays all content which can be potentially harmful for customers is labelled, so when problems with mental health are mentioned it's important to remember, that the main cause of heart attacks is human stupidity and only special TV-shows or articles in newspapers can make them more conscious.

However, other think that such athletes must be dismissed forever. This essay will discuss both points of view.
I can say without any hesitation that professional sportsmen, caught with taking illegal drugs, should not be banned for a whole career. Firstly, a lot of professional athletes are really young and the end of their career may look like the end of their lives. Sportsmen are the people, who devote all their time, all their skills and all their life to trainings. If they are banned forever, they won't be able to do something instead of sport. Secondly, banning for a limited period of time will, from my point of view, help sportsmen to realize their mistake. Banning from competing frofessionally for athletes is like sending to prison for ordinary people. The main idea of it is to reabelatize, to correct the mistake. Finally, sportsmen can't even aware of the fact that they are taking illegal drugs. For instance, it happened with Maria Sharapova. She was just taking medicine including banned meldony to cure. She didn't know that it was banned. As the result, she was banned for 2 years.
Nevertheless, some people suppose that professonal athletes who have taken illegal drugs ought to be banned for the rest of their lives. They say that such sportsmen run the spirit and honor of competing. What is more, such people believe that it is dishonored to their opponent. Cheating athletes must be banned forever to set a good example to other sportsmen.
In conclusion, I should stress again that I am in favor of banning athletes from competing professionally for a certain period of time. However, the issue of punishment for taking illegal drugs is rather controversial and I do not think that there will be a 100% agreement with one of represented points of view.

However, the percentage of people in different ages inside the countries will totally change. For instance, a half of Yemen's population in 2000 was at the age between 0 and 14 years, but by 2050 this number will decrease rapidly and will be only 37%. At the same time part of population in Yemen (15-59 years old) will increase from 46,3% to 57,3%. The percentage of elderly people will remain aproximately constant in both periods.


The changes in Italian demographic situation will be as vibal as Yemen's ones: the majority of its population was about 15-59 years old in 2000, but, according to the forecast, the decline of it will be significant it will be less than a half of all population by 2050.

Crimes – corruption, murders, terrorists’ attack. Why do people commit crimes? Are they really so immoral? And why do young people become criminals?
As for me, the majority of young criminals have been born in not very healthy and well-educated families. We all know that there are some families that have a criminal past or present, in which parents (or a parent) drink or have a drug-addiction. Usually such families are very poor and fathers and mothers do not pay much attention to their children. Children see poverty, alcohol and drugs, they get used to this things, they also get used to crimes (may be they even think that it is a normal way of living and solving their problems). Such teens are usually drug-deallers, or thieves, or murderers. What can we do to help these people? It seems that their parents are not our partners if they are criminals themselves. What about teachers? As for me, teachers can help – they are able to discuss with their students different aspects of life, show that everyone can earn his living in a law way. Their also can organize any group activities – teachers and students are able to grow vegetables together (and help hungry students, who can’t eat normally at home), clean school’s yard, go in for sport, do any projects – about science and society. It seems that the government can also help these children by protecting them from violence, propahanding a healthy way of life, giving the same opportunities as the children from rich districts have.
There is another type of criminals – children who have been born in rich families, they have everything from their birthday and have nothing to do. These young people are usually drug addicted. It seems that their parents can fix the problem – they shouldn’t buy their children everything they want and show that a child should earn what he wants by himself. Teachers also can help parents in creating a good image of self-development and productive labour. Also there are teens and then young adults who have been born in rich families and which parents are not very honest – I’m talking about corruption. There are a lot of examples, when a child continues his parents’ “business” and also steals government’s money. That’s not good, but parents can’t help it this situation – only school and society can change the attitude of a child to corruption.
Teachers can not only discuss this crime with students, but also show the problems of corruption – poor children without parents, ill children and adults, bad streets, low teachers', and doctors' wages, poor old people – they all need extra money, which can be taken from the government’s money.
Also there are a lot of other types of criminals – from rich, poor and middle-class families. They all have their own problems and aims, reasons and solutions. But there is one common rule for every problem – first of all we should fix ourselves, then help our children to understand what is good and what is bad. But we should begin with ourselves.

Secondly, the graphs illustrate that the non-white general population was three times larger in the USA rather than in the UK. Furthermore this very evidence can be proved by the number of the white dwellers in the UK(12%) and in the USA(36%).

Thirdly, the percentage of the non-white prisoners in both countries was different enough.In the Uk there was less than a third of non-white men imprisoned meanwhile in the USA it can be seen more than two-thirds of the same representatives.

So governments are asked to reduce number of flights by law. Some people are hardly agree with this statement pointing on other means of transport, like ships or trains, which seem to them more ecologically-friendly. What is more, nowadays we were presented with cars, working on electric engine, which cause minimum harm to nature as soon as they do not operate with fuel. On the other hand, planes are considered to be the most secure among other means of transport. The chance of dying after air chach is enormously lower then, for instance, attend a car crash. Moreover, air travel is the fastest way of travelling and remembering that we are living in current world, where the most common idiom is “Time is money”, hardly could we deny the importance of air travel. Lots of businessmen spend most of their time doing business-trips. If they had not been able to fly from country to country, they would have spent their lives travelling endlessly. To crain it all, I should admit that air travel earned my respect after many long-hours trips to different countries, which I would not have been able to visit in case my family and I had not had an opportunity to use planes. So, I strongly disagree that we had better reduce air travelling. And the advantages of air travelling outweigh the probability of  a pollution and harm to nature.

South Asia has a great range in data. In 2000 there war 11,1 milions boys and 21,6 milions girls, which is nearly similar to information about Africa in 2012. Next 12 years the quantity of boys dropped to 5,1 millions and girls – to 4,8 millions.

On the one hand, there is a point in that idea, because if a murderer, for example, will be kept in a prison for a longer period, he won’t be able to harm other people. Such strategy in some way isolates potentially dangerous people from other world.  But on the other hand, there are several downgrades in that approach. Choosing that way of coping with crime implies that we presuppose the impossibility of personal changing. By isolating criminals the justice doesn’t give them any chance to become better and stigmatizes them as excluded from the society for the rest of their lives.  To my view, there could better ways of reducing crime. First, we could try to think about reasons which causes crime activity. For example, to my knowledge, there is a proved correlation between an average income level and an amount of crimes. So, if government imposes very high taxes and the average wages are rather low, probably changing state financial politics may help to reduce crime. Second, government can try to improve methods of working with prisoners: provide psychological help, pay more attention to their education and so forth.   To conclude, long prison sentences may be considered as effective in a way that they don’t help to cope with problem, but rather hide it. And if we won’t to reduce crime level, a deeper analysis of social situation in country is needed.",65,2,5

There two views on punishment for this action. The radical one is to forbid athlets to anticipate competions whole their life. The calmer one is to prohibit them to participate for a certain period. Nowadays this problem is really burning and I would like to resolve such a dichotomy.
Adherents of the first opinion posit that the limited period of prohibitance could be an impact to self-development and just a good example for sportsmen. For instanse, the eminent german boxer Max Gräber was banne for two years. Soon after the punishment he became a world champion. He told that thi prohibitation stimulated him to mundane training. He even supposed that if he had not been banned, he would not have won the Olympic Games. The allyes of this theory say that small periods to ban just stimulate to risk with drugs. The cost of fast is not so high.
Concerning the second idea it is difficult to underestimate its severity, but no one has any doubts in its efficiency. The most considerable example is the enermous fuss on drugs in UK. Despite the fuss, victims of this punishment finish their sport career at all. Amators of human rules highlight the austerity of this punishment ant the lack of educative element in this commitment. Mutatis mutandis in UK this system is working. There is no on occasion of drug use was not fixed until the acceptance of this law.
To summerise I have no professional opinion about this relevant problem, but as a defender of human rules, and the adherent of educative model of punishment I would agree with the first opinion. I have no doubts in great efficiency of the second one, but I think that educative part for every human is much more important.

Many world-wide companies move their places of production into developing countries, for example, Africa. People need to know, if the benefits of this development outweight the minuses.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving companies to other poorer countries has a lot of pluses for international companies. Firstly, companies have a lot of benefits from such steps, because the salaries in developing countries are lower and there are more workers. Secondly, there are less taxes and charges for companies, making the production of their goods more cheap. Thirdly, developing countries have fewer laws about the environment and all kinds of pollution, which helps companies produce their goods with less losses.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, moving to poorer countries can cause a lot of serious damages for the local people and culture. To begin with, many children are working for international companies, whose plants are located in developing countries, because they need to earn money for their families, receiving damage for their heath and chilhood. In addition, companies can pollute air, water or other natural resources, which are essential for local population, and they even can destroy some unique natural or historical masterpieces. Moreover, companies use very cheap labour, do not providing locals with medical insuranse, compensations or vacations, which makes them poorer than other population in industrial countries.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, it should be noticed that there are more disadvantages of moving international buisnesses to developing countries, because it damages badly local people.

Undoubtedly, a rise of sport facilities such as sport centers, stades o sport schools will lead to health improvements of people using them. In addition, providing possibilities of doing sports will attract teens.

This essay suggests the ideas what could cause that social phenomena, and it also gives advice to parents and teachers on the matter what can help the situation.

As far as I can see, the world where we live now is more complicated that it was years ago, and that is the main reason and the cause. As I know it from my personal experience, once a child becomes a young adult they get scared of the tons of opportunities and responsability they now have. The fear a young man has may lead to panic and misunderstanding what they should do with their life. Therefore, the lack of understanding of the society they live in forces them to make mistakes and as far as the situation deteriorates a person is likely to get influenced by the wrong people. What is more, as soon as a newly-born criminal realises and admits their sins they are already scared of the punishment and harassment they may get. So, even having realised the situtaion, they continue living the way they have been living for a good while. Thus, the main causes of that socail phenomena are complexity of the world we live in and young people's misunderstanding of the modern society.

Even though it seems to be a global problem that may need a profound approach to solve it, I think it is possible to prevent young people from comitting crimes and even help those who are already considered criminals. The lead should be taken by people who are responsable for children's socialisation: parents and teachers. Both of them should make kids understand that even if they make a mistake they are welcome to rehabilitate and nothing bad will happen to them. Moreover, teachers at school should tell students about how the world live and interact for them not to be scared of the diversity of laws, cultures, ways to live and to work. In addition, young people should be aware of different kinds of institutions existing to help them if they get in trouble.
To draw a conclusion I want to say that there are more methods that could be applied to help the problem. One method may fail in one society, while it may succeed in the other one. Each young criminal has a story to tell, thus, an individul approach may be needed.",70,2,1

But at the same time different kinds of prohibitions, which governments can introduce today, cannot solve such environmental problems like global warming and air pollution. I really believe that in our modern society we can find others factors and ways to cope with this problem. First of all, there are a large amount of different factors, which have influence on such problems. For example, some factories also can destroy our air. As I know in Magnitogorsk some factories uses a very dangerous chemical recources. Secondly, in our casual life we can use different kind of chemical.

This essay will express a point of disagreement with the issue presented. First of all, I would like to provide a brief overview, and, after that, I will add my personal standpoint.

To begin with, it is fair to mention the fact that doing sport in general can be regarded as a rather time-consuming hobby as well as simple watching games and matches.The tendency towards such a 'passive' way of participating is growing more and more popular, which has led to a great amount of agrument; whether it is worth doing at all. I adhere to the point that being involved into the world of sport even by just supporting your favorite teams may have a number of advantages. The first reason to support the idea is that people become more and more aware of the news connected with the particular area. In the long run, followers are likely to turn into active participants since they already have not only a practical constituent, but also a sufficient theoretical basis.
Moreover, sport events seem to be a really widespead topic for a heated discussion, which beneficially contributes to the development of social skills.
To sum up, it should be pointed out that people are provided with quite prospective opportunities when watching games and being a spectator at a stadium, even though it is sometimes acknowledged to be of no use.",65,2,1

In 1990 the surge began and the trend will reach the peak of 27 per cent of all men in 2040. 
Looking more closely at the trend for Sweden, it is worth saying that it is also fluctuating. There was a growth from 6 per cent in 1940 to 14 per cent in 1980, but then the trend decreased to 13 per cent in 1990.

For example, one of the most important problems is pirate copying and sharing on different social media. Because of it the inventors of music and films lose a lot of money.

On the one hand, I must say that the production of music and films demands big amount of things and human efforts. Production of media is the ability to earn money. Also illegal copies influences on the advertisment and wishes of millions peoples to watch the film or the cinema or listen to music in the payfull content. One of important things is the quality of films or quality of sounds is very low in illegal pirate copies and people cannot imagine and feel the atmosphere of film or music. This is bery important. 

On the other hand, a lot of people don’t have a money to go to the cinema for watch new film that interested a lot, or buy new soundtrack in App-store or Play market because it may be very expensive for their. Some people don’t like to go to watch films or they can’t do it because of the illness, and they practice to find pirate copies. 

For conclure, I want to say that this problems is very big and producers and users must find the compromise that allow to decide important questions. Media is one of important things in life of human and it allow to find interesting information about feelings, about world and planet.

It’s true that act of making illigal copies of music or movie is a crime which has negative influence on the society as a whole and therefore heavy measures should be taken to tackle  this issue immediately.

Personally I disagree with that claim and I hold the opinion that punishment is not an effective solution to the named problem.
Undoubtely, there are some reasons for punishing people who do not pay for the content. To begin with, musicians and producers lose money they deserved and it leads to lack of motivation to create new films and music tracks. Additionally, money payed for art producers are investments in future projects. Finally, losing such amounts of money hurts not only creators, but also the government budget which has its own profit from the taxes.
Nevertheless, punishing for copying and sharing music and videos seems to be bad idea. Firstly, free products of art provides cultural development of the population. It is irrational and even unfair to punish those who are aimed at self-development but do not have money for it. This person can be a child, a student or just somebody with financial problems. Secondly, people who are able to pay will pay if they adore the content and they want to say some thanks to those who created it. Thirdly, the Internet is the informational field which is difficult to control by the law, so punishing will be technically difficult to implement.
To sum up, punishing for sharing and copying objects of art can satisfy those who produce them, but also can influence on cultural development in negative way.

This essay agrees that ‘pirates’ cause enormous losses to film makers and  producers and should be prohibited from such action. The following paragraphs will these problem.

First of all, film makers and producers spend significant amount of money in order to create art. Such quantity of funds even neglects moral hazards that are often involved in the process. Thus, by illicitly and have some profit, artists have to sell their works at certain prices. For example, Apple Music and Spotify – famous smartphone applications – allow users to access a myziad amount of playlist and albums within seconds for ten dollars a month.

Moreover money is one of the crucial forces that include people to work. Without being paid. Certain artists may become discouraged to work in this field and eventually stop creating music and movies. In this scenario, the whole society will become worse off. For instance, if everything became free, producers and musicans  would not have possibly enought funds to implement their bright ideas. Hence, it is particulary important that we, as the main audience of artists support them via officially purchasing their works. Additionally the people, who violate these rules should penalized with full responsibility. 

In conclusion, the works of producers and musicians should be protected by the law, and people who illegally copy and further propagate the works should be punished. It’s a result of such rules, people will be better off as a whole.

If students see that their legally binding rights are not protected , this could being strikes and, consequently, decreasing of government’s authority. Business books emphosise , that society and all its members must feel confident in every step taking by politics and what is more , to have an essense of non-restricted protection. For example, my friend from Ukraine have told me, that the reason why his family encourages the actions of current revolution is complet misunderstand and frustration connecting with governmental apporat. 
Moreover, the popular thought about diversification of subject regarding to their so-called use only for one sex should be rejected. Every child or every student has his or her own views on the world , and they all have their own preferences. That’s why to limit the number of subjects which , for example, a girl could take seems abormal. The magasine named “Slon” writes , that the men differs from the woman only physically and now it’s very easy to mess both groups. For example, I’ve read about person , who has more male interests that female’s ones and behave herself according to rules , which society always consideres as male one.
And least , but no less, is phyhological problem: students should study and live in society where all roles are taken. It’s not surprising , that girls and boys have different attitude in 90% times (as British newspaper “Guardian” claims) and that’s why they have to korn something from each other. For example, I know a girl, who studied only with other girls. She always says now , that such life is horrible.
All in all, it should be noted , that equal rights in society should be considered as healthy way to live. No one mustn’t suffer because of their sex identity.

This statement has both sides.

My belief is that people have to do sport, not just be fans. Firstly, it is really wasting of time to watch it, because it has emerged not as attractive performance, but as way to keep your body in fit. The antient greecs did not discover the Olympic games to entertain the audience. It was the competition, in which you can prove and check yourself. Secondly, people, who are watching sport events in real life or on TV, usually are very ""reputable"" critics. They just want their favourite team or wgatever to win. But people become very dissapointed, if something goes wrong. In that case we all can give a lot of worth advice while sitting in the sofe. Finally, the question is, why do not you do sport? I suppose that, it is impossible to watch but not to do. How about the motivation and the wish to look like participans of sport events.

On the other hand, there are a lot of invalid people, who have no opportunity to become a word-known sportsman or simply do it for their pleasure. Due to this fact, watching is a compromise, which can brings they to their dream a bit closer. Moreover, as it was mentioned above, sport is the cause of appearing the myriad of fans.
They, of course, could do some fitness or play football or whatever. In this case, it is the part of their life, the vital one. So, importance could not be a wasting of time.

To conclude, the sport is vital part of people's lifes. It gives us a lot of opportunities and improves our phisical and moral health. But the main problem is to manage somehow watching and doing, because if we split them up, sport will continue to be a vital part, however watching may be the cause of a planty of diverse problems.",60,2,3

As for the first opinion, it is easy to understand where it comes from. If you sentence a crime for longer term in jail, there is less time for him left to make more crimes when he is out. On the other hand, prisons nowadays are not the places where you could be taught not to commit crimes. A lot of self-education books tell us, that you must be surrounded by people who encourage you to be the better version of yourself. But for a person in a prison it is hard to find any other surrounding that the one that consists only of the people who has comitted crime. For me it is the reason for searching better ways of reducing crime. I think, Norwegian jails is a good example of ideal ones. As I have read, prisoners in these jails can work (but not have to) and are paid considered amount of money for their work. They also can get new profession there, if they want to. Which means, that after leaving the prison they would have some money and a demandable profession to start a completly new life. The Norwegian prison is bright and has a big library and lots of others education and sport facilities, which makes it ideal place for person reforming. I think, person is more tend to commit a crime when he is despirate, when there is nothing to lose for him, when he has no money, no education, no life opportunities. The other one important trigger for breaking the law is bad people around, for example, people, who was born in a families where one of the parents was sentenced to a prison term are more likely to commit crimes. That why I believe, that methods, that are used in the Norwegian jails are better, than just giving longer prison sentences.",65,2,2

In general, the first chart consists of two upward tends that witness a significant increase in global tourism from 1979 to 1999. It is not (notenothy?) that, starting off at similar levels, the figures grew up at a different pace.

Looking at the details, it can be seen that in 1979 around 12 million UK residents went abroad. Then, the trend saw a gradual rise levelled off at 20 millions in 1985. After that, there was a dramatical growth over the next 14 years hitting the peak at more than 50 millions in 1999. 

Regarding the second tend, the number of visitors to the UK didn’t change so significantly. In contrast, the figure experienced a stable rise over the period starting at 10 million visitors in 1979 and reaching the number of almost 30 millions by the end of the period.

Considering the second chart, it can be noticed that in 1999 the most popular foreign countries for British people were France, Spain, USA, Greece and Turkey. The first two places are France and Spain with more than 20 million visitors in total, while for other three countries the number of visitors amounts to 2.5 millions on overage. 

Overall, it can be concluded that in comparison with the number of visitors to UK, the number of UK residents who go abroad increased more significantly and at faster rate. The chart also provided us with data on the most popular destinations among British people which are France and Spain.

People always in hurry and they have to eat in fast food restaurant which negativly affects them. Others meanwhile sit all day in the office or at home spending time in the internet or at work at computer. Here comes the question – how to improve public health?
Some people say that in order to improve public health the best way is to increase the number of sports facilities. They say that due to training in the sport facility people will improve their life condition and stregth their powers and energy. People will visit gyms which will be closer to their own homes, because it will be much convinient then drive to the other part of town. As a consequence in sports facilities will be more free space to give more comfort to a clients.
On the other hand some people claim that sports facilities would  have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. They sure that people which have never been to the gym will not go to train in it even if it will be located near their house. Moreover due to it the population which regulary visit sports facilities will not row so much to cover the cost of opening new gym. 
I agree with the last opinion because to my mind in the first place to increase the number of sports facilities we have to make sure that people are interested in it. It will do a lot of damage to the economy to invest money in industry with low demand on its` services. We have to more effectively use this investment. In that way we can do a survey to ask people to choose from several options of public health improvement and find out which of them will be more useful.

Besides, it could help to decrease air pollution. I do not support that point of view for a variety of reasons. Firstly, government should not make people to reduce the quantity if their flight unless they are not ready to suggest the type od transport as convenient as plane. Now the prices of plane and train tickets are approximately equal, but the duration of flight and train travel are much different. Thus government and society should think not of restriction as the solution of the problem, but of new ways to travel, for example, to make train cheaper and faster. Secondly, reducing air travelling could decreased business activity in country, so it would be harmful for national economy. Everyday thousands of people make business trips and it will be impossible or much more expensive with that law and high costs for firms are apparent. Opposite to my opinion, some people claim that ecology is the most important now. It is the right statement, but partly. It is needed where the situation is critical, for instance, in China, country, where impossible to breath in industrial cities. That is why air pollution by planes is not problem.

Othes don`t think so, because it have a little affect to our health. Is it true or false? We try to answer a bit later. 
On the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities can help everyone to become healther. But it need some time for this, for example, we need to visit gym twice a week for 2 hour. Some people don`t have these time. Furthemore, to become stronger you should have some diet, if you don`t, any sport facilities can`t help you. On the other hand, without a huge number of sport facilities, you can`t find you sport, which you like and which is more usefull for you. So people will not doing sport well and then it will be a result of small effect for them. Another reason of small effect is wrong timetable. Your sports activity should be regulary, and at the one time. If you don`t follow your timetable, all you activity will had a bad result. So a big amount of sport facilities will help your to follow timetable and to have a amazing result.
To sum the information, we can say that a uncreasing amount of sport facilities help people to fing their sport and do it regular. As a result men`s health would be better.

Obviously, studying process is very hard and very long, so as people might well tire of learning something every day. However, it is considered by some people that having a gap year is a waste of time.
Firstly, waiting a year before entering university ma give you so much new emotions, as you are able to visit foreign countries, experise new activities, meat interesting people and make friends with them. Moreover, while this free year somebody can settle down: marry, have children.
What is more, the gap year provide people with time, which could be spent on gaining knowledge, skills they will need in the university. For example, when a person whant to be a programmer, he should be developed in terms of Maths, Phisics, should know at least one of the languages. Unfortunately, school does not give opportunities for gaining these skills. Therefore, a person needs time to improve his level.
However, there could be some problems with a gap year. For instance, a financial problem, which might well prevent a person from spending a gap year beneficially, as special courses and travelling, cost a lot of money.
Also, there might well be a problem with changing interests and requests during the year without studying, For example, being upset with his faults, when a subject is too difficult, a person can change his mind about becoming a programmer. 
Summing up, a gap year is worth trying, although there are some drawbacks. However, I consider them to be not so important, as if you want to benefit from a gap year, you will do it without any money and you will cope with other problems.

The essay examines both sides of this exiting issue.

On the one hand, there is a common belief that expenditure on science is a waste of time and money and the govenmental budget should allocated more prudently for folloing ressons. Firstly, lives of many sitizents is likely to be threatened when the poverty rate in a country is quite high and this condition should be the driven force behind the governmental expenditure. If government does not pay attention on this instead of scientific research, the hunanity will experience the great calamity. Secondly, disater will appear if the government skips the enviromental problem. It can be resulted in a lot of deseases , a big amount of victims among the animals and lack of meal for people as a outcome.

But on the other hand, many peole, including me, opine that without science, especially without space exploration the life will lose its meanings. Only by dint of scientific research the humanity has the world we live in, and the scence of existing in expolarion new areas, in knoledge that can be dispenced in the right way to open new horizon.
If goverment spent money only on public needs , the life would be less intresting , people would be less prominent. Space pursuit provide people with willing to research, with aim to make something new for the future, to make life better down the road

The proportion for machinery transportation was six times higher using railways than roads. By contrast, food products transportation is only 11% for railways, while the proportion for road transportation is 30%.

So what are these problems? 

It is obvious that since computers became a common part of our lives people became not as active as other generations used to be and it affects our health. Firstly, inactive lifestyle slows down the bloodstream in the body, which leads to many problems in long term. Secondly, sitting a lit is not good for human’s spine. Thirdly, looking at the monitor for many hours can really damage our eyes. Needless to say that not only computers can cause an increase in our health problems. TV sets can also be very dangerous for eyes, mobile phones and other gadgets can really ruin children’s mental health sometimes and also some devices can have a small amount of radiation too.

So, what are the ways to reduce some of these problems? In general, it is important not to spend all the time surrounded by gadgets and devices. If your job requires to work on the computer all day long it is crucial to do some exercises every day and to let your eyes have some rest every half of an hour.

Many people want to buy some part of art and to have it at home. But now some artists can not work because there are no places where they can work.
Being artists is too hard because they have many problem when try to write masterpiece. Sometimes this problem is connected with their wish, sometimes with place of dream, because they can not find it, or with government restrictions, so they can not draw all they want.
Government restrictions are one of the bad reasons why artists can not create anything. He should work in freedom in place of his dream and wish, and after that he can create masterpiece that will be famous and popular. Also, after creating new picture, by artist it can be forget, because it can have some elements that government restrict. Besides, if there is new restriction, than the picture that is famous can be destroyed.
T the other side of this problem, government restrictions should be on the way of drawing new picture, because it is our future and to change some thing of opinion about masterpiece, all can changed. People should remember about changing in the past and how it is now. Also some creative artists can create amoral picture, so government should restrict it.
However with government restrictions create some new pictures, that can be famous and popular is too hard for artists, but it should exist because another way of drawing evolution can destroy modern art and future world.

First of all, only producing food is to the one important thing that people want. All people must have clothes, electronics, furniture in own houses and etc. It country hasn’t any special factories or manifacturies on the territory it must buy goods and products abroad. This is all usually people’s equipments that government must fulfil, using different ways. If it all willn’t that people will unhappy and angry. People will not be able to fulfil own requirements because mostly good will be very expensive or even is not been able to buy in shops or somewhere. In conclusion, humans will can go abroad that is very bad factor for every country. 

On the other hand, it is interesting idea to separate countries and people. Every country and government exist independent on others. All uses own resourses that they have and produce goods and food that they able to do. In this situation colture of countries cannot changing because of no import of unknown goods and food. Also, it is way to full stopping between countries and governments. Ebery country has only own materials and food and don’t exchange with others. As a result, in world will stay undestroyed strong friendship between countries and people in different parts of Earth. 

In conclusion I would say that all countries must fulfill requirement of own population using different ways.

Music and films related many people, however, there are those who convinced that we should not pay for them and those who are believe that pirate copies and Internet downloads are illegal. The issue is rather complicated, I’m going to express my personal opinion and analyse by opponent’s one.

First of all, I disagree with those sceptics, who are convinced that music and films are beloved to musicians and producers, and there should be punishment for pirate copies. In my opinion, if a person is gifted, if he had God’s talent, his art (music, films, paintings, poems) is bellowed to the whole world, to everything. He should enjoy that the others make illegal copies from his art and save downloads for free. Because the art is not a business; it’s a way. However, those, who are not gifted and make some arts for money also should be glad that their boring arts are useful for someone.

In spite of these arguments, there are musicians and producers and directors who lose their money from pirate and Internet copies. They investate capital and time, but today less and less people buy disks with favourite group and DVD because of Internet where is possible to download everything you want and you do not need even to go out of your flat. People who earn money by art usually want save their work not only from pirate copies but also from other people’s changing, copying, cospleing. So one author want his work to laughing.

Maybe there is some points in my opponent’s position, but these people do not take into consideration the fact that we live in Internet century now, in the big open global world. Everything is bought and sold.

To sum up, I would like to put and emphasis on my opinion again. Copying and sharing music or films is not a crime o theft, people who download these files should not be punished. However, every opinion has its right to existence.

It is argued which of the characteristics have the major influence.
On the one hand, it is believed that the characteristics we are born with have the major influence on our future lives. It can be proved by the scientists who study the genom. It is obvious that children get their characteristics from their mothers and fathers. In addition to this, there are people, who believe that the day and time of baby’s birth also has great influence on his or hers future life. There is no scientific proof that astrological characteristics are absolutely true but there are a lot of people who strongly believe in it’s importance.
On the other hand, some people think that life experience influences more on our personality. Firstly, it is clear that while children are treated in different conditions, they have absolutely different behaviour. There was a research, in wich twins were kept to different families and as the result they have growed up with absolutely different personalities. Moreover, it is proved that children, whose childhood was quite difficult, cope with problems in their adulthood much easier than those who had no difficulties in their childhoods. And last point but not least is that there are a lot of examples in psychology why people absolutely changed their behaviour whyle they were put into different social and living conditions.
In my opinion, life experience has the major influence on people’s personalities. Of course, genes play also a big role but the conditions in which a person lives make this person’s personality.

What is about Samsung, this type of smartphones rose dramatically from 2010 to 2013, but then it became to decrease. It is obvious that the situation related to Blackberry and HTC wasn’t so attractive because their profits were the smallest and in 2015 profits of both Blackberry and HTC were about 5%.

TASK 1
	The pie charts show the information on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. There are two charts for Yemen and two charts for Italy, that give us an information about persantage of people under 14 years old, 15-59 years and people elder then 60 years old.
	As a pie chart of Yemen's population shows, the persantage of teenagers (0-14 years) is approximately a half from the whole population - 50.1%. Then goes persantage of people 15-59 years that reaches 46.3 percent. The smallest group of people is population over 60 years old - only 3.6%. However, projections for 2050 differ substantionally. The persantage of adult people (15-59 years) will increase for more than a half from all population - about 57.3 per cent. People with age under 14 years will have about 37%. The persantage of elder people will not vary dramatically.
	There is another situation in Italy. The persantage of people aged 15-59 dominates in 2000 (61,6%) and will dominane constantly (46.2%) in the future. Nevertheless, there is a big difference with people over 60 years. In 2000 this persantage (60+) is only 24,1%, when it will achieve 43% in 2050.
	In conclusion, I would like to say that such pie charts show us that our population is becoming elder. Those, who was teenagers in Yemen in 2000 will become aged 15-59 years in 2050. So do people in Italy. 15-59 years in 2000 and over 60 years in 2050.

I agree with this topic and I will discuss about it

Countries need to produce the food. This process include different area of production. Moreover, providing the food is develop the economy inside of countries, because people by own production food and other people who work on food stations or make food countinue to work and get salary. In addion, the prices on own production food is not high for citizens For example, people will buy more their country food than other products, because it will be cheaper and more comfortable for them to be sure that food is fresh from their countries. Thus, countries have to produce own milk, meats, fruits, vegetables etc

In my view countries should have a goal to import much less product than consume. It is important to provide own population with own food, because it develop an economy of countries Furthermore, many countries dream to have own prodation for whole population, because it means that a country do not depend from other countries For this countries need to import little products in other countries. For example, one country produce milk produest and some of these producst sell for own population and others send to second country. There will be not milk products for people from first country and they need to buy and bring milk products from other countries. Therefore, people will be angry and unhappy, because milk products will be more expensive than owns and less relaible in due not knowing about their qualities. As result, country will depend of other countries and in any global problem it will affect significantly on all population.

In conclusion, I think own produce in a contry provide works for own population, the food and a good economy  Countries need to produce own food and import as little as possible in order to be successful in economy and undepend from others.

This group of people believes that governments should develope some rules which could take under control unnecessary air travels such as business trips and holiday trips. However, this is a controversial issue worth discussing.

On the one hand, air vehicles such planes realy has a harmfull effect on the environment. To begin with, the gas produced by these vehicles is not environmentally friendly nowadays. In addition, due to the technology breakthrough, there are a lot of planes at the present, so, they pollute the atmosphere a lot. Moreover, there are a lot of different ways to get to any place you need. For example, lots of trains are extremely fast nowadays and have less influence on the air and global warming.

On the other hand, travelling by air is very comfortable. First, it is not waste of time, it is very speedy. Second, it could prove the economy of the country. Thirdly, it could give you a lot of wonderfull views. As an example, sitting near the window in the plane people could see beatiful lands and so on.

Nowadays, there are a lot of countries where children can’t study at school. The  example, ar Africa 43.7 million children didn’t have the opportunity to study in 2000. But this issue has not only location reasons, it has gender reasons too. For instance, in South Asia 11.1 million boys und 21.6 girles in 2000 have no access to primary education. And many researches ask the question: “Who will be this children?”. As for scientists’ opinions, they will become crimers, alcoholics and murders. Nevertheless to this sad tendention, we can see that in South Asia this social issue will disappear soon. In 2012 there were only 5.1 million boys and 4.8 girls without the opportunity to study in Primary School. But the location play an important role. As graph shows, in Africa this problem is solving slowly. Comparing 2000 and 2012, we can see that proportions came down only for 11%. The reason is bad and poor conditions of Africa region. Rest of World have better conditions, they have 23.3 at 2000 and 15.3 at 2012.
In conclusion, I want to say that children should go to school in all cases. Education helps children to know this difficult world. And in my opinion, kids shouldn’t be hurted by governments mistakes.

There is an opinion which says that the universities should accept equal numbers of student of both sexes in everu subject. Personally, I partly agree with this statement.
On one hand, there are a lot of advantages of including this trend into universities. We live in a democracy world where every person, not depending on a gender, has a right to have his/her own opinion. That is why, such lessons which contain equal numbers of male and female students may permit every person take active part in discussion. Such practice makes the lessons more exciting and more useful because it helps to save the democratic atmosphere in the university, furthermore, in the whole world.
One the other hand, there may be found some disadvantages of this practice. For example, sometimes, talking about certain professions, it is just impossible to accept equal numbers of male and female students. This example may be a surgerist. This profession is much more for men because it requires a big phisical power. Morever, there is a well-known fact that women are more sensible and more able to have sensitive feelings what can disturb from the job of surgerist or in military job, for example.

On the other hand, a person, who don't has any significant characteristics, but every day he want to improve himselfes was a good future. In comparison of thirst opinion, the second was more power, because a person, who wont work with brains, who will have reasons for improving the life.

There will be a significant increase in the proportion of population aged 65 and over between years 2030 to 2040 according to the data.

Then, the percentage decreased marginally and started to rise from the end of 1990-s. After the period of fluctuations it is predicted to go up from the middle of 2020-s.
It can be seen that proportion of older population in USA followed the same pattern as Sweden during the period from 1940 to 1990 at the level higher on about 2%. It has seen a period of stability during the 2000-s and also expected to increase from 2029 year.

First of all I would like to say, that there are some different point of view on this problem. Some people opien that the gouvernement need to produce the food for people, that lives in this countrie. I think this point of view are alive cause people think, that they own gouvernement will live without the food. Also some peopl think so, because they opien that, they countries is the main on the whole world.

On the other hand, there are other point of view, that the import it’s also important for gouvernement. In my opinion, when some countries import the food they make some money, therefore this will be good for economics of this countries. In addition, when countries werk together it will be great for futre world situation. Also, we can ecck at the experiance when our country (Russia) was USSR, and when we didn’t contact with many other countrie, and aim to import as little as possible, and nevertheless we have a bed situation whith import.

As for me, I completely agree with those who against punishment for sharing music or films on the Internet.
Now, almost everything became available on the Internet and I think that it is a positive trend that shouldn’t be punished. Firstly, people spend their money on cinemas and musical concerts. That is why musicians and film producers gain very large amounts of money and they wouldn’t become poor if people could listen to music or watch their films for free in some ways. Moreover, there are people who hasn’t so much money to spend it on music and films but with the help of Internet they have an apportunity to watch movies and listen to some songs.
Secondly, I think that people should avoid punishment for sharing and downloading files on the Internet because it is hard to find such criminals. Policy should interfere into user’s private life but such actions can’t garanter that policy won’t make mistackes. Furthermore, they can punish not criminals. I can edd that such undemocratic actions can lead to people’s hostility and outrange to government.
Taking everything into account I can state that it isn’t justly to punish people who only want to watch films and listen to music. Musicians and producers should understand that they have very huge amounts of money in comparison with ordinary people.

Secondly, screens of gadgets have bad influence on the human vision, The possible solution is use these technologies in more healthy way. 

Passive lifestyle, is the problem of modernization. When person is sitting beside computer all day, his heart does not have any practice due to small physical activity. It probably causes heart attacks. For example, in developed countries the rate of heart problems is extremely high. Another disadvantage of electronic devices is decrease in vision quality. When person focuses on the screen too long, his eyes get busy and reduce the quality of the around image. 

Using hi-tech to motivate people be more active  - is a possible solution.

However, I can’t fully agree with this suggestion.

Originating from feminist studies and the equality of human rights, the idea of splitting university courses in equal male and female parts seems absurd to me. The same rules and demands, imposed on university applications, regardless of the candidate gender, already become a garantee towards fair university choices.

More than that, any university is highly interested in the most talented students, despite the student;s gender. In case university admits the «half and half» proportion for the subjects, it may restrict some gifted applicants from either side.

Next, there are subjects that considered to be traditionally feminine or masculine. For example, there is a clear feminine dominance in the sphere of children’s education: kindergardens and schools, whereas in the labour domains where physical force is required, the preference is given to men. Males and females are different physically and phycologically, thus they suit better for different occupations.

Needless to say that males and females have different social roles as well. The university subjects requires corresponding climate and artificial division in halves won’t serve to the best of the atmosphere. It’s much more interesting to study with people who are encouraged and curious about the subject than with ones that were taken the form the equal proportion.

To sum up, I would like to say that history knows many examples of outstanding scientists of both genders. For the university, the prime concern should be on student’s motivation and eagerness to develop, the gender doesn’t matter. However, the equal conditions of entry and fair competition of candidates is of high importance. The university courses should form naturally, not artificially in order to provide best productivity.

Someone believes that a good decision of this will be an increase of the amount of sports facilities, but others have another point of view.
Anyway, a rise of sport centres, swimming pools, gems, etc. is a good way of solving this problem. First of all, it means that sport facilities will be near people's houses and consequantly they will not make spend too much time on just a road. Moreover, the huge number of fitness centres can impact on people's mind and help them to understand the importance of doing exercises.
Nevertheless, an easy access to sport facilities can not be the best variant in improving public health. Some people simply have not any desire to do sport and do not want to think about how it is useful. Besides, nowadays adults and expesially youngsters prefer spent their time playing computer games or chatting with friends in social networks and are not interesting in their helth.

Some people also argue that some social institution like school and family have to cope with this drastic increase.
I strongly agree with the first point while having several additions to the second in order to make a solution more complex and prevention more effective.
At first, among noteably wide groups of youths lawful actions and civilized behaviour considered sign of weakness. This has come from masculine traditions of the past and better survived in either closed racial communities, for example, people of color in USA, or in bad economic environment, for instance, in small towns of Central Rusia. It causes hatred and ganging (like in notorious LA gangs ""Bloods"" and ""Crips"") and class misunderstanding (rage against the well-off). At second, international distribution of wealth may provide newcomers with anxienty and willing to bury with the whole society in order to eliminate and get closer to benefits. We see that many young people consider their environment ghetto with ways away only in outlawed activities. Lifestyle of drugdealers known from massculture rends to be get serious and flawless causing massive addiction to rap industry with it's countinious deviso ""money, women and weed"". It makes drug making, and distribution with sexual harrasment the most widely spread problems of a generation.
From my point of view, the only way from this toxic features of modern society is to change seriously roadmap of budget expendtures for upcoming years. We have to change the roots of culture by either melting everybody at the same pot or provide with enough room for tradition self-identifying to mostly in religious way. However, cobblestone of tradition has been removed almost everywhere and we grew apart of.
I suppose, support of programs claryfying the positive outcome of education and self-development have to be put widely. We see one of the closest relation in economics, friendship between unemployment and crime rate. Youth themselves ful support of doing nothing and using public and family funds to pay checks. And see no way to get a job because of international competition with cheaper rivals from Asia. So we have to make them thinking that stereotype of getting out of poor by outlaw behaviour is unfair, that the only place under the sun reserved for hardworking specialists.
To make a long story short, the problem of young people getting trapped by outlaw behaviour is provided by tough solution of changing the way they understand opportunities.

How universities could accept an equal numbers, depents only on the gender?! In a case of global (except two or three countries) situation, when the number of women is obviously higher, than men is. According to the given theory, 2% or 3% of female entering students have to be cancelled in entering the subject. Without prejudice, just because of «equal number of male and female students». Also, all male students have to be accepted, without any dependence of their knowledge level.

The second question, that I can notice in a (?)-stetement, is an extremely clear difference: there are too many men on a tech subjects, and on the other hand: too many women on civil subjects. I think, that it is normal, especially nowadays, when this difference becomes smaller and smaller. Anyway, as a rule, women are more emotional and common for all types of arts, while men can think more analicly.

Nowadays, the gender difference becomes empty, too far from reality. I’ve got a lot of friends from really tech faculties and universities, and they are women, and sometimes, they are really more successful than men. At the same time, plenty of my friends and me, study civils, and it’s really interesting, I guess we do some success in this subject!

First of all, it is important for people to have hobby, so sport is a good thing to do in your free time. If there are some sport facilities, it is easy to find something yours. So, I think the goverbnet has to make some sport activities, what will improve public health. For example, muss runnig in the center of the city. It is not only good for health, but also help people to communicate with each other. 


The second point I want to talk, is sport facilities in schools. It is important for children from young years have a healthy lifestyle. So football, basketball, volleyball and so on activities in school after subjects are very necessary for childrens future and their health.


But there are other opinion, that increasing the number of sport facilities would have just a little effect on public health. It is thought that oter measures are more required. I can agree with that statement, because these arrangements are not enough for improving public health, but it is still important to pay peoples attention at sport and, as result, at their own health.


To sum up, I want to add, that the health of nations is our important goal. And in every country government has to increase public health it could be not only sport facilities, but also health centers or something else. All the world has to assume measures to improve public health.

Likewise, in our world, especially nowadays, every person should show the loest results, but the standards are high.

This thrend has undothle benefits. First of all, thia year helps people to relax and go away from routine life in schools.

It is proved that when a person watches something on a TV or on his gadget, he closes his eyes more rarely than usually, which has a bad effect on his health. 

Another problem is the increasing number of heart attacks. Young people used to carry their mobile phones in their pockets near their hearts. Moreover, modern teenagers and adults do not do sports regularly.

However, there are a range of solution. People can reduce these problems only if they really want to do it. 

The first possible decision is persuading people to do sports regularly. For example, employers can organize trainings for workers in their offices during breaks. Secondly, employers and owners of food stores can advertise healthy food and healthy lifestyle. Thirdly, teachers in schools and universities should tell children and youngsters about the damage caused by long-time use of gadgets.

The sport gives us a lot of energy and positive, it can make us get out of bed early. But there are people, who has different problems with heart, for example. And for them the big number of sports activities can be dangerous, that is why just using of the amount of sports facilities can not be the only way to solve this problem.
On the other hand, some people say that sport does not give us a huge effect and does not improve our health. These people think, that must be others ways to become healthier. Maybe they mean, that we should spend more time on the open air or eat only fresh and healthy food. But all these measures can not be useful without some physical activities or relaxation like yoga. This type of sport makes us more calm and makes our bodies and our minds clearly and healthier.

There are a lot reasons why such people think that the first works are better than the second ones. By the way, some people are against this point of view and think that governments should spend more money on local films. In this essay I will prove both opinions and show with which point of view I more agree.
First of all, the main reason why people prefer American and British films is the fact that the most popular actors play exactly in them. People watch films as they want to see celebraties. Local works rarely show them as the money that these actors earn sometimes are higher that the the sum of money spent on the whole local film. The second reason why films made by Americans are more preferable to people is that they are brighter, more amazing and more interesting than local films are. Creating films in America, a lot of people work on a plot, decorations and costumes. Unfortunately, producers of local films cannot afford this and they have to produce films sometimes using old materials: those that have been already used in previous films. The third reason for the fact that American and British films are much better is that English is an international language that is learned all over the world. Watching film in English improves your knowledge of language. Many people learn it and that is why films produced in English are more popular among those who want the language be perfect.
In my opinion, governments should spend more money on local film industries as a lot of traditions are shown in these films. This art allow people to save thair customs and demonstrate of what they are proud. It is impossible to make it without good financial support.
All in all, people should not forget about films that are made in their mother land. However, English films are important too. People should watch both kinds of films to broaden their horizons and not to forget where they born and how their home looks like.",60,2,0

Countries produce several ways to protect people and the most popular is to give longer prison sentences. But sometimes there are more effective ways to reduce crime. The most common is to held prisoners for a long time. This would mean that in perspective governments would reduce number of prisoners on the freedom. This idea is used when people need to deal with rapidly growing crime rate fast. When future prisoners think of making money or killing someone, they would think about how law protects his target, hence, sometimes crime would be cenceld. There is one a very huge drawback in this method the cost of a prison. Every quard, dog cell and room in a prison building cost doubled because of the risk. And this money would be taken from locals, what should in the future provide an idea for crime. This close connection between money spend on prisons and crime rate is an underwater rocks for many laws and ways to deal with crimes. But, there are ways to solve this problem. Prisoners are people wich potentially could do a hard work. If government can provide a special building for working with materials  like wood or metal, this can afford to not just help people to reabilitise, but also a few money. Several American state prisons already involved this possibility to a right way. The conclusion here is simple, longer prison sentences has not only an advantages and drawbacks too. The key to success in reducing crime rate is rehabilitation. If prisons can provide it, ay method can be helpful.

On the one hand, it can be a good idea to accept the similar number of male and female in one subject because it can be interesting for people to comunicate with each other. Moreover, these people can miss more lessons because when girls, for example, will have attention from boys, they will want to go to university more (this situation can happen with men too). In addition, a lot of people are single from philology faculty ir mathematic faculty, because they are always busy with their study in order to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend outside from ther university, but if there is the similar quantity of male and female on the one faculty or even on the one subject, these people can have a private life.

This statement is contraversial, but in my oppinion there is a few reasons to disagree with it.

First of all, by importing food ammount of witch can not be eaten by population, country can make money to export products wich it desperatly needed. For examle, in Soviet Union huge ammount of bread seed was importing to other countries for exchange to manufactural machines. It caused a lot of deaths by starvation, but that was the only way to overrun technological progress of other countries. Now, as there is no food problem in modern countries, wich import could boost economy of the country.

Also, some countries will do not have stable income of food and water supplies, such as poor African countries. The only way for them to feed population is to export food in exchange of natural goods, such as oil, gas and others. Decreasing food import from rich countries could be leathal for poor one.

In addition, country also should have additional food storage in case of some unexpectable issues, wich can be floode, carthoprafes or anythink else.

To summarise everythink, even though not every single slice of food would be eaten by country population there is no reason to cut its production. Import of food not just make economy stronger, but also can help other countries. Thas is why food production should not be decreased.

It can be clearly seen that there is a dramatic difference between some regions.
To begin with, it should be said that in Northern Africa and Southern Asia the number of unemployed people remained stable in 2014 and 2015 (12,5% for N. Africa and 3,9% for S. Asia for both years). At the same time three other regions consist of two groups: with rising unemployment level and decreasing level of unemployment. The first group has only European union whereas the second one contains Middle East and Latin America (in 2014 11% and 6,8% for Middle East and Latin America and in 2015 9,6% and 5,8% for both of them). As for the EU, the unemployment rate for this region had not changed too much: from 7,5% in 2014 to 7,9% in 2015.

Who is right? In this essay we will have a look at both sides and I will give my own view. To start with, Facebook and Vkontakte have a wide audience, this is why sending information is really easy, as you may not only pass it to your friends or family, but also to other people. For example, news agencies have their own pages, where they place all the news uptime and people are getting to know about it as they receive notifications on their cellphones and computers. This is very impressive and useful, as you may find out that the rod, you drive for work is closed and get to know about other routs. Social networks are also great for knowledge exchange. Students or teachers (school, university) can send their studies or works just by a click of the mouse to others, that could be in many miles away. On the other hand, people argue that the main aim for such social media as Facebook and Vkontakte is to entertain. Yet, they have a point. Tis sources provide a wide range of games, fun pictures, programs for singing and a lot more. Entertainment is the way how these sites attract attention to them. Nevertheless, this is one of the main ways of earning money by such social networks. They provide additional abilities in the sphere of entertainment for the real money. To sum up, I would like to say that Facebook and Vkontakte are known all over the world, and the only reason for it is because they continue sharing information and entertainment. There are a lot of other websites that give an ability to exchange knowledge and even more that entertain its users. This is why it is difficult to imagine Facebook or Vkontakte without one of these aspect.

Of course, some of innovations may decrease our health. For example, our vision becomes worse because of regular using of computers or phones, our ability to beat hear is damages by music in a big volume. But is it problems of modern technology? How can we influence on solving this problem?

First, we should remember that we responsible for taking care of ourselves and we should control our habbits which can decrease our health. If we know that long-term using can lead to some problems, we should use it less even if we do not want to do it. Second, we should always read instructions from creators of technology in order to know all possible cases and the ways of their solving. Each technology has its own warning, so we always may get to know activities we should not or must not to do. Also, if it can decrease health, we will learn if from instruction. The third argument is we can switch to eco innocations. Most of them created with purpose not to damage the environment and not to decrease people’s health. Technological progress allows us buy more and more safety things, which have no bad influence on people. We should focus on this area as investors, developers, creators or customers. 

Thus, technology may has bad influence on our health, but it is only our responsibility to control the number of influence. We should be solution oriented people if we want to stop it.

Air travel gave people ability to visit far ends of the world. But is this invention safe for the planet we live on?
It is said that airplanes pollute air and this is certainly an awful thing. So from one point of view, it is necessary to reduce the number of flights made on a daily matter. First of all, our duty is to safe planet from our own existence and it seems reasonable to cut the amount of air travel. Government should push laws concerning the air traffic, but they also must consider the consequensies. This means that regarding the fact that people are not prepared to sacrafice their right to travel. They will search for alternative ways to travel. So, no wonder, if the amount of cars, buses and other means of transport would take their lead.
To my mind, it is irrational for governments to enforce air companies to decrease the number of flights considerably. That may lead to other problems which are harder to solve. Moreover, closing air space over some countries as a way of reduction air traffic may be considered as a threat by other countries which would cause more tension than ever before.
In other words, the idea of considerable intervention in the air travel by government is a complete failure. Companies must decide themselves if they are ready to sacrafise their incomes for the sake of planet or not.

This essay will consider some causes of this problem and will attept to offer some possible solutions.

First of all, the rising crime rate among young people is caused by poverty. What I am trying to say is that it is becoming more difficult to get a good education and to be employed by a prestigious company or run one's own business and have a decent income. That is why many people try to get money illegally, because it is the only way they have access to. A possible sollutution is to provide such people with higher salaries. For instance, the countries where there are higher rates of income, there are lower crime rates.

Another possible reason is the decline of traditional values. What I mean by this is that modern values emphasise the necessity of achievements, but do not pay enough attention to moral values and the patterns of behaviour, which are appropriate in the society. One of the solutions, which can be offered, is to demostrate the consequences of such actions in order to make young people dwell on this issue. A typical example is the practice in some schools in the USA to organise excursions to prisons, where teenagers have an opportunity to evaluate the situation and make the necessary conclusions.

To sum up, the rise of crime rates amid young people is borne out of various reason existing in the society, like poverty or changing values. Although, these problems can be solved by improvig the financial situation of this social group or by making young people aware of the consequences of illegal actions.",65,2,3

On the one hand, those people who produce music and films have author rights. It is clearly that they want to have their money back. They spend a lot of time for doing their job well. Also the put their soul inside of every film, song, video and etc. The can not do something if pirates share their art in the black internet. Because in cyber platform it is impossible to stop the process of sharing information. For example, police just can not punish all of the people who download pirate copies because it can be millions of them.

On another hand, people who download pirate copies from the Internet usually do not have opportunity to buy each song and each movie. Some of the artist can be not allowed in different countries so you can not enjoy their art. By the way, today pirate’s activities are not allowed in countries like USA or Europe. It means that goverment is interested in punishing pirates. Also to help people who do not have any opportunity  to pay for music and films in the Internet was created a lot of free platforms like Youtube, Vimeo and Soundcloud. You can not download something from there but if you are online you can simply listen music or watch movies, for free.

In conclusion, people should use free platforms or buy music or film to make our world better. Also if musicians and film producer will get their rue salaries then products which are created by them will have better quality.

It is a very popular and useful method of keeping fit and healthy. Sport can be a source of entertainment. Many people take up different sports as a hobby. But for some people sport can be a way of making money. Those people can earn money by setting up a sport business, betting, working as a coach, etc. But some people take part in sport competitions to win money and popularity. Frequently, such sportsmen take dopping and other illegal drugs to bit their opponents. How that should be punished?
Some people believe that dopping is not a seriou crime. After some time the effects of drugs will disappear and the sportsmen can return to the competitions ""clean"". That is why, people who used drugs should not be allowed to participate in competitions for different time periods according to the characteristics of the medicine they used. That seems fair enough but not everyone would agree with it.
On the other hand, some think that such sportsmen should be ban ned for professional competiting for the rest of their lives. First of all, some medicines will affect sportsmen for ever, their effect will not disappear. Then, using drugs is terribly unfair to other competitors. But banning sportsmen for the rest of their lives could be an extremely strict sollution.
As for me, using drugs in professional sport is inevitible. I have been practising capoeira for 10 year. I have met many professional sportsmen from all over the world. All of them used legal strong drugs just to gain the minimun necessary conditions just to be at ""professional"" categorie. Those who wanted to be champions used illegal ones. Moreover, some drugs today can cause genes and DNA changes in future children, which is not a dopping or a flood. Should those children be allowed to compete? In my opinion, modern sportsystem should be totally changed and coordenated with the modern pharmacy
In conclusion, using drugs by professional sportsmen is an important social problem. People argue about its sollution.

First of all, it cannot be denied that giving longer prison sentences will reduce crime, because the people who going to do illegal action, will more afraid consequenses. However, according to statistic, the majority, who have been in prison, will break law again with large probability. For instance, in Russia, a perecent of recediensts is about 90% it is evidence, that the better way is to discourage people break law. The issue is what this way is. Ther are several approaches to solve it. The first one is make life condictions better by doing this people will have less reasons to break law, and so the crime will reduce. For example, the government may give better help for people who have differenties with their health, wealth and family. The second one, the mass media may make sure people in dangerouse of crime, in awful consequences, in psychologic sufficinets and others. Thus, people will suggest a risk of breaking law else, and then they will do this less frequently as before. I think, that the crime level can be reduced because of efforts of government, citizens and mass media.

The system should also prevent further crimes and, accordingly, a question arises whether longer prison sentences are efficient. Some people believe that the longer a sentence is, the more fear it evokes in the souls of potential criminals. Prison is considered to be hell on earth and it is supposed that a person would try to avoid it by all means if the sentence is long enough. Furthermore, longer sentences prevent a person from having a normal lifestyle for more years, which can be a terrifying perspective. Apart from that, dangerous prisoners could be kept away from society for a longer time and, therefore, cease to threaten life of people. On the other hand, prison changes a person rapidly so that criminals adjust to life there. It is obvious that prison alters people not depending on the length of the sentence. In addition, a lot of workforce kept in prisons doing manual work would not contribute to the economic welfare of a country. Moreover, longer sentences mean higher expences for a state, which can also have a negative impact on the economy. Consequently, economic instability may lead to crime rates increasing. Thus, this measure may turn out to be counterproductive. To my mind, longer sentences would not be efficient in reducing crime. I presume that introducing an improvesd system of fines is a more reasonable and plausible solution. Not only do they punish criminals and prevent people from committing further crimes, but they also can become a source of income for a country.",80,2,1

In my essay I will look at different points of view and give my opinion. To start with, I absolutely agree that social media are associated with global virtual world where we can find a lot of new and interesting information. From day to day people are surfing the net and sharing information with their virtual friends. For example, there are many groups in Vkontakte, which are devoted to various fields and subjects. People join these groups and communicate providing new information. However, it’s known that social web-sites are full of incorrect information. People often falsify some advertisements on the Internet in order to attract the virtual audience. For instance, advertisements about getting cars free re very popular in social media. As regard using Vkontakte or Facebook as the entertainment I agree with the fact that web-sites are mostly used to meet new friends, watch videos, listen the music or play games. In other words, social media give people opportunity to relax and have fun. There is a great number of different games, videos on social web-sites that can prevent a user from being bored. We can take the well-known videos of internet bloggers as an example. Nevertheless, if a person can demonstrate his willpower and self-organization probably he will become dependent on these web-pages sooner or later. Today spending time for social web-pages is usually considered as the waste of time. In conclusion, social media can be used for both sharing or providing information and entertaining. Personally, I believe that the main purpose of depends on what a person want to get new friends, new information, new experience. Social media present a various choice of interesting things.

On the other hand Internet can make people more violent and may be angry. Video-games, action films rude communication all of this may lead to commiting crimes in real life.
To solve this problem teachers and parents should try to teach young people some empathy that depeciated in electronic era. Or maybe we should try to reshape the way how teenagers use Internet. Like educational courses instead video games or pictures. 
Another way of solving this problem is stop to enlight crimes commited by teenagers. They shouldn't know the person but should know the punishment he or she got.

The level of the crime of children and teenagers strictly reflects the future for decades. Nowadays this question is even more important then before because young people start to commit more crimes. It is possible to find some connections between crime level and level of the education, economic situation.
If we look at past, we will find that for a centuries young people were required to work in field for example. They needed to work hard to help their family to survive. Children from rich families studied in academies with very strict control for them. It is not hard to see that young people had not had enough time to do crime. Nowadays the situation is completely different. Except of some African and Asian countries, the world is enough developed to allow young people to be free. The problem of crimes are committed by young people strictly connect to the level of the education, I think. Without public education children from poor families are not able to get an education. They miss the lessons about society, do not get understanding of evil and good, which is usually described in the classical literature. Also problems with economic situation may lead to increasing in crime level. If there is high rate of unemployment, young people are forced to do crime, because it is the easiest way to make money for food and cloth.
Parents and teachers are able to improve the situation. It is important to provide right moral values for children. Young people need to see kind and honest people around them except of greedy millionairs in TV-shows, who are able to do everything for money. It is also important for parents and teachers to teach young people to love classic literature, as the archive of human wisdom.

Nowadays, the crime rates among youngsters are higher than they have ever been before. However, the situation can be changed for the better. In this essay, I will define the possible causes of the current situation and discuss solutions to this issue.
To start with, modern teenagers are exposed to violence everyday. Constant reports about murders and wars have made violence become a part of our lives, and it no longer seems to be something outstanding. Secondly, crimes and murders play a large role in the modern culture, being shown in practically every computer game, film or TV show. Both factors mentioned make young people perceive crime as something conventional, something that is possible to be commited by anyone. Lastly, there are not so many teenagers who are well aware of the modern laws and what kind of punishment follows a theft, for instance.

In order to change the situation, numerous measures need to be taken. First of all, awareness of law and punishment should be raised. This could be done by organizing special classes at schools. Moreover, teachers, having noticed alarming behaviour of some sort, should contact the child's parents to discuss and prevent the possible problems that might occur. Secondly, with the children being more preoccupied with extracarricular activities there would be less time for them to break the law. To achieve that, parents should listen carefully to what their children are interested in to try and provide them with an opportunity to dedicate themselves to a hobby of their liking. Lastly, a more global step should be taken. So as to shift the way crime is thought of, our culture is to be changed. It is easy to make money on violence on the screens, but it also leads to certain negative consequences to be dealt with.
To sum up, crime among young people is a problem that needs to be solved. And this can only be done by taking all the measures possible. Personally, I believe that occupying children with something of their interest is a great thing to start with.",75,2,1

Many people, who download thees files is punished. I agree that this category of people should be arested.
First of all, people do this punishment without telling to autor of original music. Follow, the autor doesn’t where his music is located. Secondly The pirate copies can used by people in many places likes restorants and other can think that it is original.
 On the other hand, copying and sharing music of films on the internet makes it more popular and famous. Moreover, autors of music and film can became really good and famous person. 
To continue arguments of discussion there are many people, who download pirate files by buying the original discs. They spend money for this and after that they do sharing for free. However, it doesn’t compare with losing huge amounts of money every years by producers they. They lose money because pirate copies is selled and people buy it.
To conclude the argument of essay, people who donload pirate illegal files of musics and films etc, should be punished because these people do unlaw things. Moreover, they ignore the law about intellectual promity.

In the process of thought many people embark on varieties of fields. It is nowadays well-known subject to create pictures, music but how much freedom is entitled by the government? The issue in my writing for free-express idea in the field of creative arts. 
It is a fact when freeness comes around that everyone selects the way of disuse. Manually, an artist innovates whatever he or she wishes that is calles freedom of expression. Moreover different people have different choices, artists are not exaptional. They can sometimes create art which may affect in society or culture even to the young star. For instance teenagers are naturally influenced by the bad film so such type of film creation can be harmful for the country. A legal action rather than free voice is the best approach for a government. 
In addition, listening music is the most interesting habit for all classes of people. Apart from the negative side, artists can keep traditional cuture by making attractive music on native culture. Is this sense, they are wealth of a nation. Many historical books are taught as an academic lesson in school. If artists have more freedom in terms of writing may be encouraged of their creativing in art fields. 
In conclusion, due to the increase of excessive freely art mayn cause a dangerous impact on every spare of the country. I strongly believe that creative artists are to be valved and will have free voice in crucial writing.

Concerning this period it can be assumed that the country was undergoing some dramatic changes so that the death rate was high which prevented the growth of population. However, the tendency started to change: the number of people grew gradually during further 150 years. Finally, the number of Americans escalated sharply in the second half of the 20th century, which can be explained by the sudden sharp rise of birth rate.

Recently, more and more music and film companies close the free access to their product. More and more tracking program like ‘torrent’ become illegal and closed. It happens because people who make music or films don’t want lose their money. The main reason is that they be might no have enough money to make a new product if they didn’t get enough from the recent. If you really want to see the new film maded by your best film producer or hear the new music maded by your best artist or group, you should buy the original discs to give them a money for new works.

However, another people don’t want to pay for content they like. They think that all of this products must be free for all people.

This is a vital problem for our society and it must be solved rapidly and efficiently. In this essay I'll try to analyse the problem and propose some solutions.
The first reason for young people to become criminals is their poverty. Social division today is gross. Many families are deprived from the sheer necessities. Families of this sort sometimes have to steal for living. The solution for this problem is a social help programs. These programs can contribute to the general condition of living. However, the main drawback of this suggestion is high cost. One more reason for youngsters to commit crimes is the deficit of empathy. They cannot feel the pain of other people, cannot feel sympathy. One of ways to solve the problem is to establish some sort of ""empathy hour"" in either kindergarden or school. It can contribute to a proper upbringing of children - they will learn how to sympathise to others. Nevertheless, this is not the easiest way to solve the problem as it is quite complicated to create.
The last reason I suggest is a disrespect for law. Young people feel to obligation in acting according to the law because they have no respect for it. The legislative system sometimes is too complicated for them to follow. The solution is general enlightenment in the judicial sphere. People should know the basic laws of the community from the very childhood. Still, it can be very hard to explain the laws not only to youngsters but also to professionals.
To sum it up, many solutions can be found for this problem. I suppose that the third solution is the best one because it is beneficial for everyone.",65,2,0

First of all, it is noticeable that there are two regions where this indicator remained stable. In Northern Africa the percentage of unemployment was on the level of 12,5%. The same situation is in South Asia, where the indicator was 3,9%

In other regions there is a decrepancy between two indicators. In the Middle East the number of unemployers dropped significantly and it is a positive trend. Whereas in Latin America the unemployment rate dropped slightly. The EU is unique region where the percentage of unemployment rised. But it is clear that the percentage did not increased sharply.

Some people believe that a lot of travelling is unnecessary and the number of travel for business and leisure should be reduced by the government. Personally I do not suppose that it can be possible and in this essay it will be discussed why.

First of all banning some kinds of travelling and decreasing the number of flights can lead to many personal problems between people. This law can destroy a lot of private plans which are essential for somebody. For example, a woman has not seen her children who live in another country for many years because of the work. She finally has time now to visit them but there is not any flight and in addition she will not have an opportunity to do this later.

Certainly, such kind of personal situation is a drop in an ocean of problems which can be brought by air pollution and global warming. So I would recommend to reduce the amount of air travel until scientists wouldn't have invented some ecological alternative mean of air transport.

In conclusion, it is recommended to solve the problem of air pollution and global warming by inventing some ways to use an ecological transport but not reducing the amount of air travel. Because people, in general, will not be satisfied when some laws destroys their personal important plans. Moreover people would not enjoy their life without traveling and learning unfamiliar culture which also means a lot for international communications.

On the one hand, governments could unite their opportunities and organize mutual special schedule of flights. They could divide it into following categories: “rare” and “frequent” flights, because in most cases planes are almost empty. Secondary, government could encourage people by travelling, another types of machines, create special conditions, which are practically similar to the benefits of air travel (time, convenience). On the other hand, thanks to achievements of technological progress government can force private companies to shift on BIO fuel, which are safer and less harmful. On the contrary, to confine flights mean to ignore economical factors: much countries survive thanks to tourism and it can lead to its default. Nevertheless, both positions have upsides and downsides, however the most rational measure is to reduce frequent flights and improve, perfect, implementate the achievements of technological progress; switch to BIO fuel, built fast, ground transport and take care of estate of environment for further generations.

It is a big problem for producers because they lost much money. Some people think that government should apply different punishments. In the essay it is worth discussing this problem from different points of view.
On the one hand, people, who download different files without buying must be punished. There are some reasons for that. Firstly, producers spend much money on the process of work and equipment. For instance, decorations have high cost. I think, it is fairly if people who download files free will be punished. Secondly, producers and musicians spend their time for making films and musics, and tey should get salary. But if people don’t buy musics and films producers will not get money and they can not live in good conditions.
On the other hand, the opportunity which allows people download different files is very useful and helpful for people who had not much money. For example, my friend who lives in poor family always download different movies about science without buying. I noticed that his level of education increased. He became more intelligent and smart.
To sum up, such fact that people can download musics, films and other files without buying has advantage for poor people, but instead this factor, I think that people should pay for films, musics and so on. Government and producers must cut down the prices for people in poverty, and if they do not pay they will be punished.

Let’s observe the issue.

To begin with, I would like to say that one reason is the education from student’s families, their parents. Parents don’t have a lot of free time, because they only work. To reach a fortune is value for parents nowadays. Also, two reason is a bad education at school. I believe, that a lots students dislike schools, because subjects don’t interesting and typical. Also, pupils don’t have pleasure of subjects, that also change of mood them and countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour.

To continue the topic, I can say, that this problem with bad behaviour of pupils can solve. In my opinion, parents must spend make time with their children. Certainly, they must go for a walk together, visit some museums and communicate with daughter and son. As for me, my family spend time with me, talk with me. Also, more important, schools should know students, who are not well-behaved so as to reeducate them, preventing them from affecting other students.

In conclusion, it is not only responsibility of families and schools but also the whole society to solve behavioral problems. In addition, those solutions mentioned above should be taken action before the problems becoming too bad to be fixed.

But the Internet is also widespread and sometimes it is easier to find something online. But the question is: is it normal to theft foreign work? There are several opinions about this problem. Some people claim that downloading some files instead of buying the originals is unacceptable. 
Firstly, when you theft someone work, this person or company can incur losses. For example, someone prefers downloading films, rather than going to the cinema and buying tickets. In that case, cinema and creators of the film can lose huge amounts of money every year. Secondly, if musicians and film producers lose a lot of money, the will not have possability to create something new.
But other people claim, that downloading files, music or coping films should not be punished. First of all, if some people or song is widespread, it will be deffinately good for musician or producer. For example, spreading copies of music on some pirate sites can increase level of popularity of musician. Next reason is, that spreading some films, even illegitimately can notably breden people’s minds. For example, spreading some educational film can increase level of our knowledge. 
As for me, I agree with the first opinion, because spreading pirate copies is illegal and beadly impacts on music and film industry.
In conclusion, I would like to say that music and films play very important part in the morden world. So we should support musicians and film producers buying original discs or ticets in the cinema.

Put differently, artists should have the right to express their own ideas in whatever ways they like.

Some people think that the best way is to give longer prison sentences, while others believe that there are an alternative ways of reducing crime.
The first point of view can exist, but I'm not absolutely agree. I don't believe that it can help to reduce crime, because prisoners can used to it, to approximately live in prison. Some prisoners don't care about stay in prison during a life or a few years. However, it's also a good punichement anyway.
I agree with the other point of view that there are an alternative ways to reduce crime. I suppose that the most criminals spent their childhood in awful conditions with violence.
So when the grow up they became agressive and desperate in life and start to commit crimes. I think that it's possible for government to take care of such families, invest money for the better future. I realise that it is not the best way to reduce crime, but it's a try. Another way I see is to make an influence on child and tell them the consequences of commited crime. Also they should grow up in the warm and lovely atmosphere. I suggest that everything starts in the childhood.

Overall, teenagers spent more their time on sport than adults approximately 2 times. The average time which they do sport is 200 minuts togetger man and woman. However, the gender has an influence on the average time spent. If we look at the bar chart, we can see that man spent significally more time on sport exercises than woman and young girl. For example, from 45 to 54 years woman spent about 70 minuts on sport, while man are doing sport in 2 times more.
As may be concluded from the chart, with the age people spent less their time on sport and to 75 years old they nearly ended doing the exercises. In 75 years old man spent only around 29 minuts on sport, while woman spent a way over this amount, 10 minuts. The average time spent amoung adults people is about 110 and 100 minuts in period of a lifetime 35-44 and 45-54 respectively.

Some would argue that is very costly and impossible, others would say that it is a great way to increase welfare of people. However, from my point of view, there is something that should be considered about.
Beginning with the cost, which will be got from the federal budget of a country, implying the loss of money, that could be applied to some crucial aspects connected to the existing problems, which need to be solved, for example: health care, education, legislative system and others. That will undoubtedly trigger a resonance in society and social institutions.
Another opinion states that, on the contrary, if the system is introduced, the level of welfare will take a higher point in people’s living. Everyone will be wealthier with an increased salary and at the same time happier, that he can let buy himself more and live better than he used to. Unfortunately, I do not think the guaranteed basic income will cover all people’s need for unconstrained living, so that citizens will be readily got used to it.

This situation made a lot of noise and scandals in media world, between employers of chanells and make harm for collaboration of BBC Chanell and First Chanell A lot of worries happened in fandom of Russia creators of TV series “Sherlock” were disappointed by this case.

One of the most agreed-upon possible solutions to this problem comes from space travel and space colonization. However, as always, there is a huge debate on whether this problem is urgent enough or should our government instead spent its money on more pressing isssues, like poverty and world pollution.
As for me, I firmly believe that space exploration is deeply benefitial to our society and should not be swept under the carpet in favor of working on other problems of modern society. The first argument in favor of that, in my opinion, is that with space travel comes an age of technical advancement, which, in turn, causes some issues to become more managable. Secondly, with the colonization of other planets, the number of opportunities for making money should skyrocket. It is even possible that a lot of civilians, as opposed to scientists, will find new ways of doing some things or even make a major discovery, thus causing their names to be forever remembered. Moreover, space travel is a fairly recent dream, while such problems as poverty were already experiensed for as long as thousands of years into the past. With that in mind, why should we even pay so much attention to these problems, if they have long proved themselves to be unsolvable?
Overall, I can certainlly see why some people and even politicians consider space exploration a waste of time and money, however, all things considered, such view is extremely near-sighted and can cause a great number of problems in the long run.",70,2,1

The issue is being discussed now more often than any times earlier. All the technologies are developing and it can't pass by sport. Cases of athlets caught using drugs are so common that the issue of the punishment they have to get is really crusial.
There is an opinion that athlets who used banned drugs have to be out of professional sport for a limited period. It seems to be fair because sometimes it is not the athlet fault, for instanse when it was used by doctors to make an atlet feel better and make the pain less. Sometimes it is not so obvious that some months later the pills will be confirmed as drugs. So, banning the athlet from competing for the rest of his or her life is too strict.
From the other hand, drugs have their influence on sport results even if it was used as medicine - we can't ignore this fact, and usually doctors know about the effects and they use them anyway. Sometimes it is just coach who is informed about the pills' effect and they use them on purpose. However strict punishment for the atlet such as being out of professional competition for the rest of athlet's life can make coaches think twice before cheating.
In my opinion, whole the life disqualification should exist as a form of possible punishment, as a note for all the athlets to be honest: with themselves, their fans and other competitors, however prooves have to be strong and obvious to use this kind of banning. For most the cases, from my point of view, we have ban for grugs for some years. It's enough to make athlet think twice but there is a chance to prove their right for sport. Athough, an athet cauught using drugs more than once has to be banned forever.

It is even more relevant nowadays, when the amount of crimes rises every year in our country. There are many arguements about ways of lowering the level of crimes in the society, so let's look at both opinions.
Some people think, that the most effective way of dealing with criminal problem is giving longer prison sentences. They say that it makes people more afraid of the punishment for the crimes they could commit, so in this case fear can prevent crimes.
They also state that isolating all the criminals from the society for a long period of time is much more effective, because If all the criminals cannot commit crimes, the problem is solved, so prison is a perfect measure of social safety. Finally they say that prison can teach people how to become healthy part of the society, so schools and education in prisons can help people to socialise after leaving the prison.
But there is another opinion. There are people who think that prolonging prison sentences can just make the whole situation worse. Firstly, the prison cannot make people better. There are no proper system of prison education in our country, so people in prisons just do not get opportunity to take any kind of courses. Secondly, the chance of becoming part of the criminal world is much higher in prison, especially for young people, Thirdly, just isolating criminals from the society does not stop other people from commiting new crimes.
As for me, I strongly believe that prison can niether stop people from commiting crimes, nor make people better citizens. Prison just ruines people's lives. It is well shown in Shalamov's stories or the tale of Showshenk by Steven King. People in prison can just commit new crimes, because there is no other way for them to live. To conclude, Though there is an opinion that main measure of dealing with crime issue are prisons, I so not agree. I sill believe that there are many other social ways to deal with this problem",70,2,3

Generally speaking, a close connection between date of opening and the length of the railway can be noticed in 5 out of 6 cities. The older railway systems are assosiated with longer routes. For example, London underground railway was opened in 1863 and the length of its route is 394 kilometres; while the railway system in Kyoto is 118 years younger and lasts for only 11 kilometres. The only exception from common trend is the underground system in Los Angeles. It is 17 kilometres longer than in Kyoto despite of the fact that it was built 20 years later, in 2001.
In contrast, the amount of passengers per year seems to be not so strictly connected with opening date and kilometres of route. For example, Tokyo has 1927 million of passengers in the underground railways with 155 kilometres of route. Meanwhile, the railway system in Washington DC is 29 kilometres shorter it has less than 10% of Washington’s amount of passengers. For London and Paris with 394 and 199 kilometres of route respectively there is a negative connection between length of railways and passengers per year.

This essay suggests that the biggest health problems caused by technology are mental disorders and problems with vision mostly in childhood and submits the paret control of children’s usage of technology or obligatory prohibition of this usage as the viavle solution.

The foremost health problems caused by vanguard technology as we already said, are mental disorders and damaged vision. People say that violent video games, for example, can severely harm young inquisitive minds if we are talking about children while constant looking at the screens of TV sets of computers without any doubt will damage your ability to see things properly. Talking about mental problems even adults can become too aggressive which sometimes can result in mental disorders. The recent study carried out by Higher School of Economics fount out that the probability of children getting mental problems increases by 15% if they are constantly using technology; which the adults this increase is about 10% and the probability of getting problems with vision increases by 50%.

However, there is always a solution. First of all, you have to just control the amount of time you spend with the modern technology. Secondly, parents if their children are overusing TV, for instance, they can even prohibit the usage itself. The RBC in its latest edition reported that if we pay our attention to the time we spend using modern technology we can decrease the probability of getting disorders by 30%. 

In conclusion, although modern technology is essential for our live it is highly recommended to control the time you spend or sometimes even waste on TVs or computers. This will help you to decrease the probability of getting some problems with health.

There are a lot of ways to prove it. Some people hope the best way to do this is to rise the quantity of sports facilities. But other think that this way is not effective and there are some measures that can help more quickly and effectively.
Those people, who consider that we can improve our health to increase the number of such facilities, as gums, stadions, swimming pools and so on, say that if there were right amount of such facilities, people would go to them more frequent than now. Moreover, large quantity of gyms and pools will be cause of price decreasing and people also will go to them, because it will be cheap for them. Furthemore, it becomes the mainstream in society and all members of such society will have desire to achieve some results that are took by their friends or someone else. 
Nevertheless, there is point of view that against increasing of sports facilities, because they think it is spending of money and time in vain. What is more, such people consider the main problem of public health is bad food, that are the main cause of all illnesses. Other measures are to increase the number of good food adds that will provide all vitamins and minerals to each person, because 80% of illnesses from the deticit of such ingridients and from bad nutrition.
To my mind, there is both pros and corns in this issue, but I think it is better to improve our food preferences by increasing the number of shops with healthy food or provide some TV-programmes that explain how to choose good food for your health or how to keep the right plan of a day to improve your health.

However, there are some experts, who think that pirate copies are more convenient to use and people do not have to pay for music they listen.

I believe that musician should receive money for work they have done. Firstly, it is their work, just imagine that someone did not pay for something you have done for him. Unfortunately, people get used to not paying for music, for example, social networking – vkontakte, where you can find any song you want for free. Just several month ago they did advertising in songs, to pay for musicians. Secondly, the quality of legal music differ from illegal, it is much higher. 

Of course, we can understand people, who do not want to pay for music. For example, it is not convenient, when you cannot paste the song you want in youtube video, nevertheless you name the real author.

Moreover, there are services where you can pay a certain fee for a month and listen any music you want and it will be legal. Every person should decide for himself that for good music you should pay money. But it will be with high quality. 

To sum up, I would like to say that every person should be payed for the work he/she has done. If people will download only legal music it will be more convenient and fair. For example, I listen music in iTunes and do not listen to music n VK, because I understat that the quality is really very different. And the sound is different too.

That affect statistic much, as fifth of all imprisoned people in Russia are commited in using drugs. 
The second main causation of this development is transformation of family institutions: traditional family is rare, so young people have less control over them and lack of socialization opportunities. This lack of socialisation was compensated by army in Soviet Union, but now there are do many ways evoid it. As young people have too much free time and no duties at all, they start drinking alcohol, use drugs and take part in crime activities.
Another reason of those crimes is lack of opportunities. As young people have no job and no money they start stealling money. We should help them to find jobs or provide them with enough money to live: this would also costs much, but at least won't cause a danger of crime.

This problem has become urgent, because it cause a lot of different problems. Now, lets discuss the main reasons of phenomena. There is nowhere more evident that women desire to be more independent in modern world. First of all, it is financial independence. If woman split up with man, it will be more easy to adapt to the world again. What I mean is she will have good job and experience. She do not face the problem of unemployment. Also it is belived that all parents want to supply their children with all best equipment and education. So they need a lot of money on it. If husband cannot earn necessary amount of money, his wife should searchs the job and help the family with money. For example, it is hard enough to buy a new flat with two rooms. In the past flat with two or more rooms is not considered essential. As far as I concerned, this cause a lot of problems. First of all, it can lead to the involvment of childs in criminal and bad behavior. Child spends more time on the street. It is more probability to meet the bad company and begin to smoke of drink. Also it might be stealing some food from shop or taking drugs. It is common knowledge that this phenomen can cause the feel of isolation. Child might think that he or she is not loved by parents and they find the job more interesting. It can lead to a great range of psychical illnesses. For example, my friend lose weight in order to attract the attention of her parents. She fel very lonely. To conclusion, I would like to underline that we should take into account this problem and begin to solve it gradually in order to avoid negative impact of this phenomenon.

It is a huge problem, when people copy films or music and share it in the internet. Such situation is very costly for the film studios and musicians. Some people consider that people, who download films and music for free from the internet, instead of buying original discs in a shop, should be punished. There are some arguments against this point of view.
Firstly, the illegal pirate copies of films and music appear in the internet after the premier of the film in cinemas. In some situations, the pirate copies appeared in the internet 2 weeks after the film started in cinemas. In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more that a budget of the film. Moreover, the quality f pirate copies is often bad, with awful sound and dark picture. That’s why a lot of people prefer to buy licensed discs. In this logic, police shouldn’t arrest people, who share files.
Then, it can be easily seen, that the governments of the different countries all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet, where people can download pirate copies of films. But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn’t work, because there are a lot of hackers, who can hack the system and continue to share illegal files. If police catch one hacker, there will be another one. This is a “circle”, and there is no way to break it.
In conclusion there should be said, that people will always share illegal films and music. In this way, the musicians and film producers should make qualitative content. If they make good films, people will visit cinemas instead of downloading films from the internet.

Firstly, especially young people tend to pass a lot of their time in front of computers playing online games, communicating with friends or simply watching videos and listening to music. These ways of spending time can lead to headaches and decrease teenagers' quality of vision. Secondly, there are a lot of Wi-fi networks all over the world that produce electronic waves. Obviously, this can badly influence our brain and body. Furthermore, people can be stressed if they do not know how to  fix the broken computer that they are working on, which impacts our nerves system and does not let humans' bodies regulate natural processes.
Nevertheless, the world is capable to reduce this affect. For example, people can limit the time working with technology to a few hours per day. Also, all the families can switch off the Wi-fi network during night time. Sometimes if it is possible, humans should have vacations outside and enjoy the nature without using any modern technologies. These ways will help to reduce most of the problems caused by electronic machines.
To conclude, it is worth mentioning that modern technology is very useful and interesting invention of the last centures. In any case, it can be harmful for the health; therefore, people should not forget to take the benefits of it wisely.

They offer different ways to make people closer to physical activities, for example to increase the number of sports classes in schools and universities, to make some gyms free and to create special sports objects for children and adults. Supporters of this point of view consider sport as the main measure for public health.
However, there are people who say that it is not enough to make public health better. Firstly, many diseases are not treated by sports, moreover, some of them ban physical activity. Secondly, nowadays the world face with the more serious problems as drug or alcohol addiction, which is more popular than laziness and absence of sports in people’s life. To make people healthier it is necessary to make our world better in such way as environment. Many people suffer from bad ecology and pollution of the environment is one of the reasons of many diseases. Moreover, it is very important to provide good quality of medical care and pharmacology, because in many countries these spheres have serious drawbacks.

It is indeniable that everyone can take part in creation spiritual values, for example films, books, paints, photos and other pieces of art. Nowadays we have a wide range of instruments to embody any extraordinary idea. In my opinion, it is absolutely essential for our freedom, tolerant society. Moreover, any kind of art is precursor of tolerant society without old-fashioned judgement. Moreover throughout the history we experienced some cases connected with governmental pressure on painers or writers. A relevant example which illustrated such situation ink with a famous Russian writer Alexander Pushkin and his unusial poems directed on illuminating the true face of current power.

I strongly believe that all kind of human activity must follow the rules. Creative people should take into account that they art could be under law or in out of accepted rules in society. It can be clearly seen that our creative activity could be useful for other people, can inspire to create something special. At the same time it is not controvershial activity. The majority of moder art tend to include such simple recommendations.

I am absolutely disagree with this statement. There are two main reasons to find this opinion wrong. 
First and the strogest reason is festures of subjects. Everyone knows, almost every university has a lot of various technical, economical, social and other departments . And it is not casually, that in technical department percentage of male students is much more. Obviously, men’s mind works another way and mathemacs, physics and other technical disciplines are easier for the most part of male than female students.  
The second cause of my point of view is variety of social roles due to gender. When we talk about democracy, we cannot exept demographic problem and duty given to women by nature. It can seem retrospective, but I believe, woman should think about offspring first, and only than about her career. Of course my opinion stand on the country of modern of modern democratic thought and a lot of people, especially some feminists, liberalists and so on, can argue with me, but I find traditional family system, when a husband makes a career and his wife grows kids , more reasonable. That’s why I see no reasons to give some additional bonuces by gender by entering into university. Although I see no reasons to restrict the female part of population too. 
In conclusion I find present educational system decent, because every student has a lot of choises and it does not depend on sex. There is no necessary changes by this issue.

Somebody argues, that sportsmen who use this medicines should be punished by disqualification for a some period (half a year, for instance). However other side of people think that sportsmen should be banned forever from competitions. In this essay we try to consider both points of view and make some conclusions.
First of all, sportsmen usually have not PhD in chemistry or medicine and they do not do on their own in all about diet, food and so on. This is their personal doctor's responsibility; it means that any illegal drugs became in sportsman's organism often through their doctor's actions or solutions. Consequently, WADA (organisation which struggles with drugs in sport) have to punish initially doctor, but not a sportsman. Furthermore, some sportsmen are young and if we disqualify them forever, his career will destroy and world lose new talent. So, the optimal decision is ban him for a short period it teaches him be more attentive.
But on the other hand a thought punishment is ban for the rest of live) can make the situation with drugs declined. It is connected with fear about their careers in rest of sportsmen: if they see punishments of other people, they will try to not use any drugs.
As for me, I suppose that ban for a limited period has more justice than ban for a limited period has more justice than disqualification for the rest of live. We can give to person chance to change himself, choose a new way in professional sport without any preparats that not allowed and he may understand that drugs not do not match with his career and that the crime does not pay.
To conclude, drugs, specially in sport, are always wrong decision for people who want to live without any problems with life and professional success, have to reject from drugs in any form.

But the social view on this practise vary across the countries and depend from relation of citizens to importancy of intellectual rights and country’s law. In Western democratic societies people can think that this practice is illegal and unnormal, however people in not such democratic societies as European or American can think that practise of pirat copying is normal and 
So there ate two point of view on this situation with pirat copying.
Firstly, almost all people in really democratic societies think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet and downloading these files is not acceptable for fair people and good citizens because if you do that you steal money from producers and musicians, which spend a lot of time, money and other resources for making this product. So in these societies pirate copying is bad and illegal. “Intellectual pirates” like a stealler, so they are punished by government and societies. Exactly by this reason there are a lot of scandalous deals in courts of this government. Intellectual rights as one of the main principles of modern democracy protected by Western governments.
The other situation with problem of pirate copying in developed countries like Russia and other post-soviet countries. There are not culture of protecting of intellectual rights in these societies, so people such as musicians and producers of the films understand that government do not punish for pirate copying. For people of this country is normal and not amoral because they have another culture, another view on rights. They usually say, that they do not live in a good welfare state, so they only try to survive in this situation, when you do not have money for paying for music or film on the internet.
All in all, pirate copying is not good deal, but in some countries is normal situation. I think it is not normal.

First of all, we cannot deny the fact that multinational brands are recognizable all around the country and they provide people with quality, so that we may be sure in things, that we will get from this company. For example, everyone knows shop named ""Zara"", each time people visit this place all around the world, they know what kind of clothes they are buying, it is on top of fashion, it made from beautiful materials and so on.

On the other hand, small local businesses pay many taxes, that is the base for country's economy and for its budget. That is the reason why government of the developed countries are trying to encourage appearance of small businesses. Moreover, such a business gives people the opportunity to decide on product, so in Moscow we have many shops of organic food, which do not connected to multinational brands and every time I am buying products for my family I can chose the most appropriate for me thing, that is a great idea.

The main point is that in the USA the numbers are much higher than in all other three countries.
Firstly, it must be mentioned that in 2014 the numbers of print was the biggest in all 4 countries, although the USA show the highest among all (10,5 billion dollars). The same situation will be in 2018 (the USA - 7,5, the UK - 2, Germany - 6, China - 4,2) even though there will be a decrease in numbers except Germany where there will be the stabilization.
Second point which should be emphasized is that in all 4 countries the amount of money connected with the eBook market will also grow up. Here the USA will also present the first place. In Germany and China the numbers will increase on 0,5 billion dollars only (from 1 to 1,5 billion dollars in Germany and from 0,5 billion dollars to 1 billion in China).

And there is No doubt that all of them have some influence on us, so we are changed with time going. And it is also a common knowledge that every person is born with some characteristics, which serve a background for forming of personality. As it is said, some resent researches had indicated that characteristics we are born with and the developed once have much more influence on our personality than any experiences we have in our life. I can't agree with this statement fooly. On the one hand, characteristics we are born with are very important I understand it for sure. You are born with them and they come to you from your percents and there is nothing you can do yo change them. But on the other hand, the experiences you Farr trough your development, because you develop together with your experiences and under their influence. My point of view, that any person can make out of itself a person he or she locents. But it takes a lot of time to works in order to form your personality. It is called window. And it comes in many years to those who works on themselfs and may never come to ones who don't care about theirs spirit and soul.
But what I am totally sure in is that development together with life experience is much more stronger and important than the characteristics we are born with. And, for example, I myself try to get rid of the bad charactestics I was born with and to stronger the good inborn characteristics. I can't stay that I'm good at it yet, but I think that in many years, and through out every year, with every new experience. Finally I will change myself and be more like the ""ideal"" personality for me.

Japan has the highest percentage of long-living people, the second place has Sweeden, and percentage in the USA in 2040 is a little bit lower, but still remains rather high - about 24 percents.

This increase is not sustainable. In Sweeden there are three waves of rising the percentage of old people.

Than it hits the highest point in 2040. In Japan the situation is different. From the start the percentage of long living people is the lowest and even decreases in the 1940s until the 1960s.

To start with, the proportion of manufactured production delivered by rail is approximately the same as proportion supplied by road. The figures reach 25% and 28% respectively. Moreover, there is a considerable differences between transportation of food products due to the fact that more food transported by the road, while only 11% of food production moved by railroad.

However, using planes leads to serious ecological problems like global warming and air pollution. That is why some people think that goverment should decline the number of air travel. I disagree with this point of view for several reasons.
The first reason why I have the opposite to such statement opinion is globalazation. In modern world communications between countries become closer and you can use this situation for both: leisure and work. For your leisure activities you can use plane as a way for travelling, for meeting with other cultures, people, for seeing the lifestyles which are opposite to yours. Also, air travel are more commonly use for business. Nowadays, there are a huge amount of international companies which have their business in many countries in the world. That is more, people are more often go outseas to find a better place to work.
The second reason is a advantage of plane from other means of transport. The air travel is the fastest way to get almost to any place in the world. It is convevient because, for instance, using train you cannot cross the ocean and so on.
Summing it up I would like to say that air travel is an important part of modern person life. In my opinion, government should have a politics which leads to decreasing harmful effect of using air travel rather that introduce special laws which will decrease the number of air travel and get the globalization worse.

However, I can not agree with this point of view. Personally, I think that our special experience, communications and integration with the others have big if not to say the greatest influence on our success, personal development and personality. 
On the one hand, I can understand why the researchers come to this point. Our sex, race, physical ability of course have impact on our lives. Especially, that pattern was very widely spread in the last periods, before post industrial stage of development. For example, slavery in the USA of XIX to starting of XX century. In that case, a child of slaves could not get success in his life, became rich and absolutely free person.
On the other hand. it is commonly known that nowadays in developed countries it is not so hard to became well-being done. For instance, in my homeland, Russia, we have many wonderful opportunities to increase our social status. There is free higher education almost for everybody. One can just pass state exams, send results to the university, that he or she wants to attend, and wait about one or two months. It is not important whether you are poor or rich, from small or big city and so on.
To conclude, it is needed to be said that nowadays almost everyone has a chance to reach his goal to be successful. Whatever race or gender you are, you have abilities to grow in social context.  Machatma Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, Indra Nooyi are great examples of how important is your internal strength, not your gender, money of your parents or race.

Both of view should not be underestimated and must be examined very carefully.
The first point to be considered is a restricted period of competing activity of athletes, whom used the forbidden drugs. It is the obvious answer, that sportmen must be panished, neverthe less, the tough cross on their carrier can not be done. Today, it is trully normal phenomenon of drugs' destribution in our society, but the nationalwide authority and local citizens must take a chance to retrieve sportmen's character. Otherwise, a considerable amount of athletes, should not be participated on the international competitions and introduced the glory of their own countries.

On the other hand, banning the professional carrier for any sportmen is a plausible decision to restrict the illegal activity in the healthcare sphere.

The most number of people do sports mainly when they are under 20 years old, so different sports facilities will help teenagers as there is no need to motivate them, they are young and they want to be strong and healthy, so they do sports. However, will it help older people? Also will it make all teenagers do sports, because, as was said, not the whole number of young people trys to improve their health? On the other hand, some people think that government should do something more to improve public health, they doubt that increasing the number of sports facilities will has sufficient effect, because people also should be motivated to do sports, nobody will attend gyms, swimming pools as they wouldn’t feel the needs and reasons to do it. In point of view, government should provide sufficient number of sports facilities. More over, it should create motivation by conducting different social events and making advertisement. Also it will be important, to rise prices on alcoholic drinks as it is a big snag in the process of improving public health.

Goverment may use a lot of abilities to improve the enviroment of our planet, so working with air travels may help to solve a small part of ecology problems. More than that such aspect as air travel are not the most important one because nowadays there are a lot of different things wich stimulate the pollution all over the world.
To begin improve the place where people livem they should improve the things around such as turn off, the light in time don’t lose the waste on the street. In this way goverment will not deal with such problems as air pollution, because there are a lot of ecological problems, wich humans have.
More than that, goverment should improve air ecology system. Most of dangerous pollutions associated with the technical acvices wich will very harmfull for people around the world. So, if means that recycling of the waste takes a lot of time and has an awful effect, on our planet. So, first of all, goverment should introduce law to improve people’s attitude to our planet.

To my mind, first of all people living on air planet should take care about all aspects of ecology sistem, not only air pollution and global warming. In this case our enviroment will be saved and the role of goverment in this proces will increase.

For example, in 1999 there was a massive homicide by two young guys who have killed a plenty of innocent students (their mates also). Furthermore, it was found out that it was done by the effect of horror games and different types of hard rock music. This example shows that some young adults have a very susceptible.

The minority believes that this sources are the best for communication and amusement. Personally, I donot support any idea of this two and prefer thinking that both sources are really good for all the purposes Named. I have rather good arguments in support of both ideas and now I’m going to talk about the first one. We simply can not deny the fact that Facebook and Vkontakte are now more than just messengers. I want to modalise the situation according to Russian reality. A lot of pupils, students and even adults brows interesting pages, groups, societies in Vkontakte in order to find some useful information. But the way, there are a lot of services that make the search of this information much easier and flatter. For example, one can follow interesting pages or groups and all the information being posted on their pages would be linked to his feed page. The same idea takes place in Facebook. Truly speaking, I don’t know who introduced it first, but I prefer to believe that it was first announced in Vkontakte, because it’s a Russian social network. as I said it before, now I am going to name some facts in support of the second opinion. The main feature of Vkontakte is the free access to a huge number of audios and videos. Lots of them are illegal. If you know, but our society accepts it with enthusiasm, and only. There are also a lot of minigames and a huge number or entertainment groups in Vkontakte. This makes some people believe that this media source is only good for entertainments. To conclude, it is important to say that both opinions have some serious argument in support of their positions, but in general, it would be wrong to say that one of them is true and the other is false. I think that in such situation we should reach a kind of compromise and agree that both opinions are rather good, but together they become not only good, but also correct.

Moreover, junk, which all people and many different  factories have, damage oceans, rivers, forests, and it is cause, why many people have many king of problem with their health, and, also, many organisms and animals died.

In my opinion government should care about all the problems that connected with nature, because for air companies and its holders saving our nature doesn’t give and benefit. So the laws like high tax rates will help to reduce negative impact on air and get money for cleaning it that will increase the utility of government.
On the other had every tax causes negatively on economic issue. However, a revenue of air companies will decrease, the prices for fly will become higher and someone will not have possibility to travel for a holidays.
By the way, I suppose that we should think not only about the economic side of a problem. It is obvious that oar pollution ang global warming have a negative impact on social welfare. It is known fact that increasing level of social welfare is the main purpose of government.
To conclude I want to notice that government should use its institutions to improve the welfare of its citizens and I strongly believe that high tax rates on air companies will help to save our nature and protect us from other unconsidered consequenses of global warming.

These creative people have many ideas which should be expressed and it wil be unfair if officials restrict their freedom. Humanity has the beautiful works of art, dramatics and musical compositions thanks to talented artists who had no limitations. 
On the other hand, not all creative people have the ideas which can be appreciated in our society. Their creations probably can be shocking, indecent and cruel.

To what extend do you agree or disagree?
The idea of making university equal – for boys and girls? Sounds good. But I don’t like the way, how authors want to make it real. On the one hand – when in class teacher had the same proportion of both sex – it’s a good posibility to work with gender differences in different areas of science – because there will be a lot of opinions from both sides. But on the other hand, - which one is scary me more – how in our real life universities will try to do this. Maybe they will make a rough rools for student, maybe someone won’t go to the class he wants – because there, for example, will be enough boys.
The main aid if universities should be quality of the education they made not the numbers of female (or male) students at the course. And for this equity they should make good options and good atmosphere  for learning and studing both sides of the medal – female and male. That missunderstanding is very important – not every teacher can think that way. Maybe someone has different opinion because if his historical country development – or religion, or smth else. It shouldn’t be a problem.  
So, because of that reasons, I can’t agree with the statement – idea is good, but not quite good in reality situation. 
In conclusion I would like to say that now some big and famous universities have a problem with gender stereotypes – maybe some girl wants to have military education – and for her it’s impossible.
Or there is an another situation – when a male student wants to be a designer, but he will be the only man in this group because of the speciality.  So, to solve these problems with gender character, university should do something else exept making the numbers equal, and try a few different ways – like making a non – gender ads or organize a special help for not ordinary students.

Secondly,tomy mind, we are where we live. Nature is necessary part of our lifes and humanity will not be happy if nature is ruined.

First of all different countries have differen climate and cant grow some plants. We can’t grow oranges or bannanas in the north, but he cant grow potatoes in the south. In the modern word we havenot problem with transport be tween countries, we can use trains in one  continent, or ships between different continents and sell some food. For example Russia red fish in port fruits from Turkey, and export to them or we cant rise, but we can buy it in Chineese. However people want to eat different dishes, and they need for it different ingredients. Besides nort countries have winter, when they cant grow plants, but thei cam import it from sous countries.

More over inport and export is very inportant for economic at countries, for their friendship. Countries take money on costoms them import food. Also is important for politic between contries.

When our government take more more from import, then take less more from people and thei will be happier. Hovever when contries produse more food for export thei have more work places for people.

At the same time, the amount of air travels is constantly growing. Many people believe that government should make legal limits for leisure and business travel to cope with ecological problems. I am strongly agree with this opinion and will give some essential reasons in this essay.

Firstly, we are the only one who make the world for our children. It has been proven but many scientists and even international corporations that if we will not be more serious with ecological problems today, it will be impossible to live in this planet in near future. So, each of us should do something to save this planet.

Furthermore, travel limitation is important step to prevent air pollution and global warming and what is more important this step is possible to make today. Business air trips should be limited because in modern world there are many other way to deal with international business, like Skype-conference. Speaking about leisure travelings, here limitations could be made. But at the same time people need an opportunity to travel. So these limitations should be quite line for people, for example only once a year. Moreover, other ways of traveling should become cheaper at the same time.

To sum up, steps to save our planet and prevent air pollution and global warming need to be made right now and reduction of amount of leisure and business air travel with government limitation is one of these steps. So, in my personal opinion people should think about our planet and fly on planes less.

Their amount is much more than in previous years.
In my view, the most common reason which provokes to commit a crime is a wish of teenagers to show themselves in front of their mates. They do not want to be an ousider in the young group and they try to do something fascinating and wonderful, however they have not got any ideas but for to break the law. People of this age would like to be respectful, that is why they show their power. Our modern mass media also influences on the young brains. Due to abcense of censorship and a large amount of violence, the youth is becoming much more agressive than ever before. They need to get rid of their energy and then they find a way to go out the line.
The most useful way to decrease the amount of young criminals is to allow their extra energy to go in the another place. Theit parents and teachers should motivate them to find a hobby, which is able to take a lot of time. If it is impossible or very complicated for a teenager, the teachers should to increase the amount of extra lessons, to add sport activities after the main school lessons.

And the question what are the causes of this is controversial. Phycologists as well as teachers make different suggestions about this problem and about ways to cope with it.
In my point of view there is a vast majority of causes of this problems. First of all, schools often does not take into account student`s life background, their personal problems in the process of education. Secondly, schools sometimes does not watch the atmosphere in the school.  The atmosphere itself influence the relationship among students. 
Personally I think, there are a lot of approaches to this problems. Firstly, schools can hire more phycologists to deal with students` mental problems. Another solution to this problem is development of different social programmes, that could familiarize students with consequances of bad behaviour.
In conclusion, it is very important to find solutions to problems with students` behaviour due to the fact that there is a strong link between students` behaviour and their inner world.

Governments of many countries spend enormous amount of money on relevant researches, whereas a lot of other problems, such as poverty, hunger or environmental issues are still not solved. So, it is not surprising that many people think that spending money on space exploration is pointless and it would be better to work on solving more urgent problems in society.

I believe that it is a quite fair opinion. Firstly, it is not smart to spend a huge part of country's budget on space exploration when the economic situation in your country is not very stable. For example, in the last three years Russia did a few unsuccessful experiments with cargo spacecrafts (one of them was ""Progress""). These failures cost milliards and it is hard not to get angry when you think about possibility of spending these money on improving medicine or education in Russia. Secondly, the fast progress in this field of researches is not possible without common technical progress, so, spending a huge amount of money on in just makes no big sense for countries, which have not so impressive background and not well-developed technical industry. It is sad, but I am talking about Russia again: in my opinion, the country, which imports most of the technical products, just is not able to be truly successful space power.

However, it is hard to say that we do not need space exploration at all. It is well known that natural resources are not endless and one of the possible decisions of this problem is colonization of other planets. So, it is smart to start thinking about it right now. But, in my opinion, only the countries with stable economic situation can allow and have to allow themselves to spend big money on such researches and experiments: for example, I think that at this moment Elon Musk is one of the most important people for the humanity because of his space projects.

All in all, humanity obviously needs space exploration, but it is important to set priorities wisely and not think about space too much when your country has another urgent problems.",70,2,2

There are so many films, so some people think that today nobody can find out absolutely new and original plot.
Nevertheless, the biggest percentage of films people are discussing is american.
Talking about Russia, I can say that Hollywood films catch more attention.
Why is it so?
Of course, the most obvious reason is in high quality of american production.
Films from the USA are realy interesting, contains good graphics, have talanted actors in the cast.
Filming industry there is very developed and worth investing money.
Government shows big interest in regular film producing, so directors can afford expencive decorations and high-qualified workers.
Hovewer, in my opinion the main reason of this popularity is advertisement.
The ad is everywhere: on the TV, in the Internet, on the boards on the streets.
Some producers start online quizes about their films with such prises like cinema tickets, posters with actors' authographs etc.' All this stuff easely catch attention, and people become interested in what is told from everywhere.
I can't call myself film expert, in that case I want to say some my thoughts only about russian cinematography.
For some reasons, local films use wide advert company very rare, and their income show low results.
Avoiding boring and annoying ad, I want to talk about russian films themselves.
They have reputation of bad, stupid and sometimes disgusting.
Why should people spend their money on local comedy, when they are able to have a good time watching attractive film about superheroes?
The directors are interested only in money and forget about the very making a good film.
As long as directors can get money without any effort, we couldn't get attractive and amazing films.
For better results government doesn't need to increase financial support or delay foreign films, what it actualy does.
I don't want to say that Russia doesn't have talanted people, who can create good films.
There are, and many, but they can't get money for their ideas, because quite all financials go to small group of people.
I can't say, why investors continue give money to those directors, whose previous films had no success, and avoid the real professionals.
To conclude, I want to say that quality of films depends on advertisement and attitude.
American film industry shows high results because it pays attention to both factors.
In my country there can be two situations: bad films with good advert suppurt and good films, but nobody knows about them.
When our directors combine these factors, we will get film worth watching.",55,2,3

Nevertheless, according to projections, the amount of Yemen citizens, who are children and teenagers, will decrease by approximately 13 percent, while the share of Italian young people will reduce insignificantly. What is more important, the middle aged population of Yemen and Italy took a large part of all citizens in both countries. However, it was predicted that most of people, living in Yemen, will be in this age group by 2050 in comparison with Italian population, whose age will be shared almost equally between middle-aged people and more older.

TASK 2
	Some people belive that if we want to be helthier, we should spend more time on sport activities. But others do not agree with it. Let us try to consider which point of view is more correct.
	There is no doubt that sport activities have a positive effect on our health and well-being. For instance, it is proved, that people who run every day have less problems with the heart. Moreover, doctors always advice to do exercises in the morning to prevent illnesses. In my point of view, the government should promote sport in the country. For example, they can built sport ground, stadiums, increase the number of free of charge sport activities in order to all people will be able to go in for sports. So, I absolutely agree with the statement that the more sport we do the healthier we are.
	However, there is another point of view. Some people do not suppose that sport has a good effect on people's health. Probably, they think that you can be indued doing sport or something else. Or they just think that in order to improve people's health the authorities should firstly improve the medicine in country, built more new hospitals, make medicine free of charge.
	To sum up, in my point of view, a person should care about his health himself. And on of the best way to do is to go in for sports. I suppose, the government should help people by giving them the opportunities for sport activities.

Some people suggest that even in the universities the equality of male and female students does not exist and that the number of boy-students and girl-students should be equal in every subject. I am partly agree with this statement.
During the long period of time girls could not learn at schools or enter in the university, only boys could do that almost until the XIX century. In the modern world the situation was changed and both girls and boys study at school and in the university, but the number of female and male students  is often unequal: for example, in the Philology department there are significantly more girls, but, in contrast, in the department of Economics the number of male students is higher. Psychologically speaking, the equal number of both types of students influences the atmosphere in a group and the relationship between students. It is known that in female collectives there are a huge number of conflicts and intrigues. If the groups was quite equal, would the students be more friendly to each other.
On the other hand, as it was be said, the number of students in each group depends on the subject and on the interests of it. Male students prefer often learn economics or mathematics and rarely choose philology as profession. In contrast, numerous girls learns foreign languages and avoid working with statistics etc. Thus universities not always can accept the equal number of make and female students, because they are not entering each faculty equally. Moreover, some people argue that the universities should accept students for their knowledges and not for the gender reasons.
To conclude, it can be seen that the question of equality between male and female students is complicated and can be discussed during the long time. Personally, I am partly agree with the statement given, but  not fully.

Success in career,achievements in sports, high social status and etc - all of it cqan involve in formula of happiness. I think, everyone has own opinion about happiness and thus it is very difficult to define it. However, I try to show which factors help to understand or define own formula of happiness and achieve it. First of all, people should think about their targets. If someone wants to be athlete,he should train much as possible. If someone wants to earn a lot of money, he should be creativy and pragmatic. On first view it is easy to find target and create plan. But life is moire difficult and people used to reorganise own activities and change targets. 
Moreover, people should to be less serious. Of course, if someone has important task, he should be serious. It relates to scientists, doctors, policemenand etc. 
However, people need to understand that life conditions may change and they will used to live with it. If people will be not serious, they will be less sressful and nervous,  when they review own targets. 
Furthermore, when someone define own targets, he should find right instruments to achieve it. If someone wants to be famous, but do nothing or don't have any talent, theycheck false target. People should realise own possibilities. 
Thus, it can be concluded, that it is very difficult to define happiness. It is very important to see own abilities, realiuse possibilities and find right target. Targets define a sense of life.

First, let’s take a look at the ages of population of both countries in 2000. Almost a half of Yemens population is taken over by the children from 0 to 14 years, while this age group in Italy covers only 14%. The other half of Yemens population consists of 46% of adults and only 4% of elderly people. However, in Italy adults present the biggest part in population – almost 62%. And the elder part is not small too.
Then, looking at 2050 pie charts for both countries, we can see that the elder population in Yemen will not increase much, while in Italy there will be almost twice more elders. The number of people aged 0-14 years in Yemen will considerably decrease, leaving place for adult population, which will grow up by 11%.
To sum up, we can clearly see that Yemen has tendency to have more young population, while Italy has more representatives of elder age groups. And in 50 years the ages of population of both countries will change consequently.

Meanwhile other countries like Germany, China and the UK had the poorer situaton on their book markets.

This means that the chiefs of such companies build factories and plants in developing countries and hire local people to work there. Let me consider both advantages and disadvantages of the process and decide, whethere it is appropriate of not to move the business. There are several advatanges of building industrial sites in poor countries. First of all, new interprise provide work places for locals and give them chance to become more civilized. For example, when an international company moves a business to a developing country, it needs workers and for that reason provides free education for local people. Another advantage is that local children gain an opportunity to get higher education in the developed country from which the business was moved. In other words, sooner or later the new factories will need qualified local workers to be managed by, so the chiefs often build new schools in the area or provide free higher education for local youngsters. It can be added that not only schools can appear in the country of “daughter company”, but also other infrastructure facilities like roads, hospitals etc. however, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it is environmental pollution. International companies generally move the business because they do not want to harm the environment of developed countries. As a result, the pure nature of poor countries suffers from pollution. Another disadvantage is that local work force is usually cheap. People in poor countries do not require high salaries so they do hard work fro small amount of money. Summing up, we can see that there are more advantages of the process of moving business to developing countries, but I am in favour of the idea that the harm caused by disadvantages is so serious that event the improvements cannot cover it.

The lowest figures are in the morning – it stays at 30000 units and, then it starts to increase and reaches a peak at 21 o’clock. In contrast, in summer the electricity is not used a lot in morning.

For example, in the USSR was the ideal situation. There were not import, but people were happy and they were not feel deficit. People of our country made all products and food by themselvs. And that is why the USSR was the greatest country in the world with ideal economic. But there were some technologies which the soviet worker wasn’t learn. That is why we import some food from the other countries. 

But in Russia the situation is else. We import almost every product. Our fields is empty. Our country has the biggest size, but we don’t use it. Because of that a lot of people, who work in the USSR on the fields, haven’t job now. But population need food and the lonely method to get food is buy it from other countries. Exactly that is why a lot of people haven’t job and the Russia economic on the bottom. But if the government do something to change it, do something to less impor, our economic will get the second life.

They give the special significance to this term being sure that the happiness has the huge influence on our lives. However we consider some personal associations when we can see or hear this word, and finally, it is problematic to give the only definition of this state.
First of all, this happens because all people in the world are different and we have unsimilar needs and values. This means that for a man or woman who lives somewhere in a developing country without any items of communication such as the Internet or mobile set, it would be enough to have only what is necessary to his life. For example, those people who live in Africa need nothing but still water and food, but the habitants of any developed country (the European) are not happy with this, cause they need more.
The second reason is the way the person is grown in. The great role belongs to our parents and the way they mold us, cause the problem is if they give us some values or not, and what kind of values we get. Maybe they put some other impact to the happiness.
To conclude, happiness can be achieved by different ways. It is just depends on the meaning we put in this term. For everyoneit can be a smile of the person he loves, for the others it can be achieved only if they get more money.

By contrast, road transportation includes approximately 50% of their group with a 30% volume of food products. Percentage of manufactured goods delivered by both methods is quite similar.

The number of the crimes committed by youngsters reached the highest peak. Some people claim that it is a fault of modern parents. But I can argue that the causes are tied with education system.
Modern parents are mostly millenials. They spend a lot of time on job. High necessity to build the career makes people spend less time on their families. As a result, parents often entertain their kids with the help of TV, games and internet sources, which don't provide good content with adequate and useful information. Therefore, advocates of this opinion claim that this trend created the whole generation with ubnormal values and unadequate perception of the world, what is straight reason of crimes.
From my point of view, first of all crimes show that child has problems with socializing and understanding of social norms. It is meaningful function of school to teach students the fundamentals of normal behavior in society. Nowadays education system is more interested in high scores and ability of students to solve difficult tasks. But math is not the most important thing in the world. So school should provide more attention to personalities of it's students and teach them how to communicate with others; how to be responsible for your actions. School also should teach to respect other people and be tolerate.
In conclusion I want to highlight that education should be more proper. Because school is not only responsible for knowledge, but also over lives.

To start with, toddlers, teenagers and young adults struggle with inability to enjoy some sport sections, art schools and another ways of physical and spiritual education, because of being indigent. As a result, it will always come to nothing but being after wrongdoing, as people who do not have hobbies always gang up with dubious companies, go wild and commit a crime. The most effective way to change that situation is to build more educational organizations which will be affordable for people of all communities. This easy operation can improve the crime rate dramatically, because people will not have time for wasting their life in vain.

It is fair to mention, that alcohol and drugs are world-renowned and it really influences the situation. A strong propagation of tobacco, low prices for alcohol and accessibility of drugs are one of the main reasons for the spreading of crime among young generation, as all these substances worsen the mind and psyche, so people do not realize the boundary between the reality and a dream. If the government strengthens the drug struggle policy and raises the prices for tobacco goods and alcoholic drinks, there definitely will be less crime.

To sum up, the frequency of crime among young people is extremely valuable problem. Nevertheless, is can be softened by taking some measures.",65,2,2

In this essay I will analize the topic and give my opinion. 

First of all, there are many different countries in different parts of the world. Thus, in some places the climate and other environmental factors play a huge role in the country’s ability of producing food. For example, countries with warm weather tend to import a lot of vegetables and fruits because there is more than enough for the country itself. 

Secondly, it is important for countries to import food as it can be helpful for gaining budgets and keeping the economy safe and stable. For example, slightly developed countries such as India and Turkiye depend on imports a lot. 

Thirdly, if there was no import at all, the variety of food you see in most of the grocery stores would be so small that there would be deficit in some products, which could lead to overpricing. 

On the other hand, if the country relies only on its own production of food and can maintain good living standards, then having little imports could be very beneficial as it’s economy can not fluctuate because it’s less dependan on the food market.

To conclude, I personally thin  that it is great for some countries to have minimal imports if they are able to maintain in decent living standards. But the reality shows that having imports is crucial for most of the countries. That is why producing food and importing a part of it is more important.

This essay argues that jail is not a decision of this problem; however, both viewes are considered.

First of all, the main way to prevent some society members from criminal deeds is education, because it affects a person's consciousness at first. To put it more precisely, if a human is tought that crimes, murders and other types of illegal actions entail only punishment they can one day be persuaded by this propositions. For instance, today many prisoners who have comitted crimes are tought by professional psychologists and the majority of them really changes their life style. Secondly, the punishment of crimes could be toughened up in order to keep at bay some dangerous for society's safety individuals. For intstance, in the USA no the long-term isolation (because a person in this case realizes that he or she will inevitably leave a jail in the future) but the highest form of punishment - kill - motivate people not to commit such deeds. It could be also added that the purpose of reduction crimes should affect not only educational and law systems but also all social spehres where inadequate or craving for money people are under control and observation. One convincing example is special places where criminals can realize their intensions not in a harmful way; for example, they can, being under control of doctors and policemen, take care about seniors or children.
On the other hand, prison in the best teacher to convince a criminal of his or her mistakes. As it is widely known, a person who is prisoned face a lot of obstacles such as pressure of other criminals, abuse, deficiency of food which could be taken by more popular and strong prisoned ones. To set an example, many criminalas spending at least a quarter of life in jail and suffering an infinite number of problems try to live a completely different life when they are free. Moreover, the fear of a long isolation from loved ones or family members and a singnificant lack of communication, what to a certain extant affects persons' mind, can persuade criminals to abandon the type of satisfying their financial or other needs.

To sum up, moder society is highly concerned about criminals' destiny and the problem of crimes reduction and mane measures are taken in this field. But I strongly believe that prison cannot provide society members' safety without additional attempts to improve this situation in many life spheres.",70,2,1

In this case, new low, which will be created to reduce the number of air travel, may be really useful. As there are be less gazes, which pollute the athmosphere.
On the other hand, the reducing of air travel may have a negative affect on people’s life. Some families, which live far away from each other, will face the problem of disconnection. They will have some difficulties to arrange meetings. Moreover, such low will affect on the economic situation in the world. Enternational companies will not have an opportunity to lead their business. Unfortunately, the income there may be deerful. And world’s economic may face the erises. The consequenses of this situation will be seen on the population of developing countries. There will be more people, who live under poverty line.

The principal health problem, associated with widespread use of modern technology, is obesity.

This results in many people getting over weight and this problem affects the whole wellbeing of human organism. And According to some statistics, every third person in Russia suffers from obesity.
However, popularization healthy lifestyle can become a viable solution for such issue as obesity. It is clear that there is no ability today to stop technological progress. Despite this fact, some changes in peoples lifestyle can be easily implemented with the help of the government and some non-governmental organizations. These changes include mainly sports development, which primary means creation of new facilities for sports activities in both cities and countryside and engaging more people, especially young ones, in such activities. Russian government is already launching such programms and they do really work. For instance, the number of people, who do sports more than one time per week in our country rose by nearly 30% in last few years.
In conclusion, obesity is one of the main problems, connected with technological advancements, however, it can be reduced by popularization of sports activities. As special programms are already being made, peoples health is estimated to improve over upcoming years.

It is true or false? That is not an casy question and many factors have to be concidered.
 Concerning to me, this suggestion is wrong . Of course, both - female and male are equal in rights - there is no any discrimination. However, we should apply the psychology of men's and women's choice to solve this problem. Firstly, there are faculties , where men's qualities are incredibly needed. As for example building, engineering and so on. Of course, there are profession where females dominate - teaching , cooking... The next question is about interests of our categories. It is known that girls like to treat dolls, look for their brothers and sisters whenever boys are keen on construsting buildings , mechanisms of crushing them. I suggest that childhood plays unbelieveuble role in the growth of character, qualities of person . Actually, there is no question only in psychology. We should also remind physical circumstances. I suggest that there is low population of females are interested in profwssion of policeman or fire fighter because physical training are really needed for this type of work.
Taking all these facts into consideration my conclusion is that equal number of male and female student in every subject is possible but there is no practical benefit. There can be consequences which will be hard to correct - person will do the job, which he or she doesn't like or can not do.

This problem is the consumption of illegal medicine which is expanding in the whole world. There are the different points of view: some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from sport only for a limited time, while others think that they should be excluded from competing forever. In my essay I will discuss both views and give my own opinion.
I think that a lifetime ban for professional athletes who were caught using illegal drugs may have some negative sides. At first, even modern procedures of analysis can cause mistakes. If a sportsman or a sportswoman is caught on something that he/she didn't do, it will be totally unfair. Such mishap might ruin one's career or even life. At second, the problem of choosing which drugs are legal and which are not is controversial itself. For example, an athlete can use drugs, which are get not illegal. The next day or week this drug is proclaimed illegal. What is he/she going to do? So, a severe punishment can be extremely unfair.
This is the reason why many people say that athletes should be banned only for a restricted period of time. I think that this view is far more fair and conscious. If an athlete is caught on using illegal drugs, he/she can have time to think about this problem. If an athlete is eager to return to professional competition, he/she will never use these drugs in future.
As for me, I think that a strict punishment is not necessary. I agree withe the second point of view. If an athlete doesn't want to return to sport, he can do it.

Will this policy make more good than bad? This is what I’m going to speculate about in this essay.
It’s undeniable fact that the world has been undergoing huge economic downturns, that’s why nowadays it’s extremely difficult to find a job even for people with high education. The number of the unemployed has escalated drastically and it’s projected to rise. So in this case it’s quite a reasonable idea to provide people with even minimal extent of money so they can overcome these times and survive. Correspondingly, such policy may prevent death fatalities such as suicides, for example, since it’s a well-known fact that most of the times people tend to commit suicide when encountering financial problems.
Despite the fact that such program seems to be quite beneficial, it has some downsides too. First of all, the number of unemployed people will grow dramatically since there won’t be any reason for them to find a job. For example, such governmental programs exist in some countries in Europe. Almost the most part of the population is homeless people, who live for money given by government, so that there are even vast swaths of the cities of poor people. Last but not the least, even though such program will be created, it doesn’t guarantee the stability and prosperity of the country and the gap between the poor and the wealthy will still be the problem of high importance.
Concluding. Although this program seems to be beneficial it will not eradicate all the problems",70,2,0

But music and films often exist there illegally because of hackers or web-pirates take away them from the official web-sites of musicians and film producers. It is done for getting benefits and cuts owner’s profits. There are laws about private rights of property in many countries. Pirats are not always punished or pursued and moreover people downloading these files should get punishment too.
It can be agreed with the statement about getting punishment both for hackers and people using pirat’s copies. First of all, using materials of theft is the same support as making theft comes true. So, people should be punished for these acts as helpers for crimes. Beside this, people often don’t want to buy expensive legal discs and films and that is why they download pirat’s versions because of a special aim not to spend a lot of money for these media products. Moreover, there is tend to share of musical products in the Internet with friends and relatives. It means spending of objects of theft. It of course, can be pursued for judiciary by courts.
On the other side of the coin, it can be disagreed with the statement about pursueing downloading people. The first argument for their support is that they really could not know about the origin of a concrete film or music track. The most cases it is about old people who like listen to music or watch interesting films. They might not to have enough knowledges for using Internet because a computer sphere changes fast actually. So, this idea should connect with children too. They are very small, they can download fils and not to think about consequances. The second argument for disagreement is taking to attension the fact about who really thefted. It means, people need to look at the essential real crime, not to sharing music and film.
In conclusion I want to say that, of courses, all crime-makers should be punished especially how in situation that pirat’s copies are world-spread. But we need to remember that if we will juge almost everybody it can be finished by exception from the attention unnormous, irrational cases.

Consequently, if we increase lifestyle level, the rate of crimes will be reduced. It is difficult way because of economics of undeveloped countries and crisys conditions in the crime world.

Bad familie conditions like drunk or drug addicted father or mother has an impact on young children. Consequently, they became robbers or in the worse way murders.

However, many people are convinced that there should be alternative ways to make the level of crime drop down. This essay discusses both sides of the question, and offers one of existing solutions.

It is clear that being in prison for a long time can frighten potential criminals. Moreover, the risk of spending all their lives in jale can force them not to commit the crimes.

Nevertheless, if the sentence is not for all life, and the prisoner can one day go out from the jale, it is evident that he or she will be angry with all the entourage. Thus, in any case, the society stays under the danger. So then it is crucial to invent other methods of punishment. Nowadays, people from many organisations which have a deal with this subject regularly present their projects on the topic of different solutions.Some of them support the idea of reducing the number of prisons, while others offer to start paying money for appropriate behavior, or to obligate people attend special courses on how to be social, and so on.
Evidently, there are indeed many effective ways to force people not to become criminals at all. However, if the crime is already committed, there should be a method to punish criminals without strict and cruel actions. For instance, in some countries they create in prisons good conditions for criminals, so that they can read classical literature, attend technical courses where they can study new disciplines to work and earn money, walk outside and communicate with each other. So, a prison that is made according to a model of phsicologicaly healthy society can not solely punish a person, but recreate him with repaired personality.

To conclude, I would like to stress that the cruelty of human beings cannot ever create their well-being, while only being kind and understanding can help us to reach a high level of life and reduce crime.",65,2,1

To begin with, well growing up plays the significant role in behaviour of adolescents. Parents should take care of ther children and explain how vital is not to commit a crime and think about their future. As a matter of fact, a great amount of teenagers thinks that it is the most simple way to make their living and starts grabbing things from the shops. In other words, it is important to get trough the gap year by talking to you children since young age. On the other hand, it is dificcult to reach a compromise with teenagers because at this age they prefer to trust their friends and the only way to solve the problem is to control the friends of your children.

Moreover, education is a key factor to avoid crimes made by young people. To give an example, the goverment should create the course about discipline and encourage people to gain knowledge about laws and how do they work to decline the percentage of crimes. By and large, it is rather long way to get rid of crimes but it, apperently, would work. For instance, there are lessons about discrimination and sexual harassment in schools, it is possible to add talks about crimes or gives examples of people who behaved that way and ended badly.

To make a conclusion, the rising amount of crimes commited by young people is the problem which is needed to be solved so by joining efforts we can decrease the rate of crimes.",70,2,0

The speed of life increases in order to match technological, cultural and social development so living in big cities we often do not have time look after our organisms properly. We consume fast food, do not do any sport and act carelessly on our physical health. So a lot of people are concerned about what methods are best to use on purpose of the public health improvement.
Over the recent years there has been a huge growth in amount of people doing sport on their own using public sports facilities. Such people learned by themselves the benefits of that kind of keeping the body fit and they are often sure that an increase in the number of sports facilities is the best way to improve public health. 
On the other side, a lot of people tend to doubt in such opinion because just placing the facilities won`t make people do sport or even think about it. In this point, there should be some incentives that will attract new people, or there must be other measures not necessary connecting with sports facilities or even sport itself.
To sum up, it should be said that improving health is a very personal issue for anybody, thus what can be useful for one, may be harmful for someone else. So the effect of increasing sports facilities strongly depends on people.

That is why nowadays using planes is very popular way of travelling for everyone. but the issue of air travel is very controversial, because planes contribute greatly to air pollution. Let's consider its advantages and disadvanteges.

First of all, the most important benefit of air travel is reducing the time, which had been just wasted some decades ago. for example, it took weeks or even months to move to another continents, but now the same way takes only few hours. It is especially significant for businessmen, whose slogan is 'the time is the money'.

However, planes affect on the enviroment and leads to air pollution and global warming. The environmental damage is confirmed to be a danger for all human population. Nevertheless as for me, introducing laws limiting air travel for business or leisure has more cons then pros. fistly, it will be decreasing the pace of technical process and globalisation. Secondly, it may lead to corruption in the country because people will decide to buy the opportunity to travel by air unofficial.

In conclusion, I would like to say that air travel has become an essential part of modern world, and we cannon restrict it. Nevertheless, the problem of air pollution can be solved by developing of eco-technologies using governments' money as well as trans-national companies' money.

In my opinion, we should start speak about mobily telephones. Today our telephone is not only a thing to speak and contact to each other, but now mobile is our book, our game, our photo-camera and many other things. There are people who can’t even stay one hour without his/her mobile. Then they get up, they check the mobile, they read while eating. I think that modern mobile phones is an absolut bomba of very very slowly moving. Firstly we all know about radiation from all our devices. Secondly, seeting for ten to forty hours a day watching at a small screen can cause great problems with your yes. 

Another technology linked with smoking are ‘vapes’. During two years million of people botight this electron cigarette, saying that this new technology will help them to stop smoking tobacco. The problem is that nobody even think about the consisting of this vapes. Not only adult, but teenagers too smoke this electron cigarette during all day, thinking that a hundred of different peroxids will not destroy their body. Smoking is a legalized drug, by electron ciggarets are drugs being pack in a very beautiful box.

In conclusion I would like to say that the problem of our world, our decade and new technologies consist of the fact, that people buy all this new things and start to use them like absolutely crazy men. All that was made with unnatural goods should be explored by us carefully.

Such opinion that athletes who using illegal drugs should be banned from competing for some limited period exists. There is another theory that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. It is really try to decide which opinion is more powerful.
Some people believe that banning athlets from competing for ever is unfair. Person could have hard problems, also sportsmen are always in great emotional and nervous situations. So, if human have done a mistake it should not cost a career for him. Moreover, after some medical and psychology treatment athlet can work and compete in the same way.
However, others suppose that using illegal drugs in sport competitions is strictly not allowed. Athletes using drugs help themselves to be more strong and quick due to medical technology and it is unfair and unprofessionally. Besides, people using drugs usually become addictive and it is a medical problem closing the way to professional sport. Also, sometimes using hard drugs causes traumas and illnesses which can even kill sportsmen.
In my personal opinion athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for ever, because it is dangerous for themselves. It is important to say that sport demonstrates human skills and abilities and with using drugs it is just medical and pills competition, so sport just loses it's meaning. Althought, such hard questions should be discusse in professional area using rules and justice.

I suppose that artists should be able to create whatever they want. Nevertheless there have to be some restrictions related to showing it publicly.
First of all, some artists don't have any boundaries and a lot of people love their works. However, these pieces of art can be harmful for children, because they are very sensitive and they percept everything they see. That's why it's reasonable to prohibit children to watch some films, visit some exhibitions and listen to some pieces of music.
Secondly, I have mentioned earlier that these restrictions should not be too serious. It means that artists should have their right to create anything they want. If a child gets access to prohibited pieces of art it's not the fault of an artist.
Also I believe that the grown-ups are able to decide themselves whether to read a book or not, whether to go to an exhibition or not. Even if they are shocked by the way an artist expresses himself they can deal with it. That's why the adults shouldn't not be restricted from getting acquomted with this or that piece of art. The only limit has to be the dignity of other people. I think that it concerns some kinds of installations.
All in all, it seems to me that people are free to express themselves. On the other hand, they need to remember that they are not the only ones who will see their creations. The restrictions are to focus on protection of children and dignity of other people and not on some political matters. These restrictions should not be similar to censorship.

What is more, users of modern technology often suffer from sleepless. Besides, active using of different gadgets can cause proplems with eyes.
Nevertheless, there are some ways which can help to reduce or avoid these health problems. First of all, people should change their life-style on more phisically active.

The price fro air delivery will increase dramatically and a lot of businessmen will just have to stop operating because of high transportantion costs. As the world economy is balancing on the board of recession, new problems for business could lead to a big crisis. Nevertheless supporters of extra regulation of air industry claim that a lot of people buy their own planes and use them in their own interests without any control commissions linked with nature problems. This argument can be hardly taken into consideration as the statistics of nation aviation commissions show that private jets do not contribute much all-machines net flying time. In conclusion, it should be restated that extra regulation of air industry is not needed. The level of contribution of planes to air pollution s mistakable thought to be very significant and any extra regulation might hurt interests of business very much. There is also not proof that private jets deposit much to the global warming. Because of all above – told arguments governments should not introduce any strict policy to the market of business and private aviation.

It is absolutely understandable - people want to make their life safer. Here appears a question - is it reasonable, try to stop harmful behavior with harm?  On the one hand, long prison sentences literally prevent other crimes. Robber or killer will spent the rest of life in prison and will not do more harm. Moreover, law brakers afraid of prison and will not commit into crime to avoid it. On the other hand, prison deteriorate and brakes people's mind and lifes. After prison people can not find jobs, friends and change their lifestyhle on the whole. There is a big possibility that after some time person after prison will do ahother crime. This consequence is unavoidable, because people use to see and to do harm or pain.  As for me, I find long prison sentences too cruel and harmful for people. There are so many stories about people who were innocent and due to the mistake were sent to prison and lost everything. Community should create another way of improving. It could be different jobs or social help. In any case, people have to help each other and first of all government should understand, why person did the crime. I understood it after reading Leo Tolstoy's novel ""Voskresenie"", where the main character tries to understand the rules of life in prison and the reasons of beeing there. Tolstoy gives a clear idea that everybody can change the life of prisoner and prevent a crime, people should save their kindness and morality and help each other. ",60,2,1

But disproportion between male and female in different subjects at universities leads some problems with supply and demand on the labour market. So, some people belive that universities should accept the same amount of men and women students in every subjects.
On the top of that I should say that this solution can decrease a women discrimination in some proffesions, for instance in a nuclear physics or in a some government positions. Moreover, equal numbers of male and female students can make a learning science more comfortable for female as well as for male.
At the same time, this measure has a negative consequences. The first feature that I should add is that there are some fields where equal numbers of men and women is impossible. For example, police and army is mostly men's occupations, but fashion and cooking is actually women's deals.
If observe this issue from practical and realistic view, we clearly understand that universities will decline this idea because of it's unproductivity and unefficiency.
To cut a long story short, this is a very intricate problem. But it goes without saying that this trying to install a balance on a labour market can have a negative consequences.

Some people, and I am among them, believe that special laws should be introduced in orders to reduce the number of business and leisure flights. Firstly, there are other ways of moving around that could substitute air travel even when speed is the key factor. For example, modern trains, such as “Supsan”, are both convenient and really fats, so it would be reasonable to use them ore often of they contribute less to air pollution and global warming. Secondly, a lot of flights are inefficient, because celebrites or governmental people use large personal planes which could potentially carry more passengers. As many of these flights are for leisure, governments should control their frequency when it is possible. However, some people argue that there are areas where moving by plane or helicopter is much easier than by train or by car. They also say that when the distance is long the speed difference between aircrafts and vehicles becomes more significant. I agree with them to some extent. However, these arguments only mean that the laws reducing air travel should consider all the peculiarities of the region, travel distance and whether or not it is an important trip. All in all, I believe that governments should control the amount of air travel for leisure and business, reducing the numbers of flights when it is possible orders to reduce air pollution and global warming.

As for me, I can not totally agree with such position. First, there are usually fixed amounts of money a person is ready to spend on different kinds of entertainments. If he is used to go to the cinema twice a month, he won’t go there more often or pay for films at home, just because he isn’t ready to spend so much money. Second, film makers now earn fantastic amounts of money by demonstrating their films in cinemas, and what about musicians, their main source of income is their concerts. So, there is no awful need for money for them. Third, if ordinary people are punished for piracy, their dissatisfaction will be much higher than dissatisfaction of authors, whose intellectual property is stolen. This is just because piracy has become usual in our country and it will be really hard for people to stop using such content.
On the other hand, punishing for piracy can be beneficial for the whole media industry, as it will provide film makers and musicians with more resources. So, the industry is likely to develop. What is more, people will get used to respect intellectual property, what can be really beneficial for development of society.
To sum up, there are some advantages of fighting against piracy, but there are much more disadvantages. It will be better to preserve current situation, as any probable changes may cause people’s dissatisfaction and even protests.

The effects of such development stay unclear. Although, its advocates see more advantages than drawbacks.
On the one hand, giant companies representing a world-known brand are faceless. They try to manipulate their customers converting them in consumeristic belief. Moreover, speaking from the prospectives of employees working in such corporations, it is worth noting that the conditions do not correspond to standarts. Each single personality loses his significance and becomes a robot, that must pull his weight for a company to florish. Finally, such absorption of small businesses can lead to not national-oriented market, because large brands are considered to be globolized. So products will not be adapted for each culture any more.
On the other hand, giant companies provide people with a great number of work places.Also, they form the most part GDP of the country, because they are liable for mass production.

Moreover, in our modern society the majority of famous people have their own airplane and they do a lot of unnecessary air trips. And, of course, government have to control the number of air travel per day to save our planet and air pollution. What is more government can introduce some laws to control air travel for leisure.
But on the other hand, I think that it is impossible, as to calculate the data about all airplanes and air travel. What is more the majority believe that the number of air travel don not influence global warming. However, government have to control more important areas in our country. Take for example, medicine, education, pollution as a result of factories. Nevertheless, it is the fact that water pollution play the most important role in global warming. As a result, government should control not only air pollution, but it has the most important problems in our modern life.
As a result, nowadays global warming is a very important theme for some debates, but government doesn't have to forget about other problems in our countries.

This people need to be heared like no other. To begin with, creative people can express their thoughts and feelings by the way of beauty. You can always say the right things but the singer with the wonderful songs about the same theme will be seen first. Secondly, people prefer to listen ideas of interesting and smart person. If you can shows that you are creative and clever person the people would like to listen to you and may be go to you. It is all clearly for everybody.


On other hand, should there be the goverment restriction or it should not? Many artists use so special way to talk what they worry about, to introduce their own ideas. May be the goverment should look for the artists more responsible.


It is undeniable that some some of what modern artists create could be very special and unforgetable  for some people. It coul even shock somebody.

I think there is a problem number one. I guese that most popular health problem is the depression (or SAD) and humanity don’t know how they have to fight with this problem. For example, my mom has a depression because she works a lot and when she comes home she starts doing a routine house work. She forget about the rest. It’s very important don’t forget about it. She is a breddwinner in my family and this is why she has such health problem like depression, some other sickness with her head.

I think this problem might be solved if people start thinking about yourself and about their feelings and body. Maybe it is a meditation, or hobby. Something that can keep you in your mind. I guess that people mostly have a psychosomatic probleme with health in our modern world. Or they just can’t find time for the rest or going to the doctor.

All in all, I want to say that people have to believe in yourself, take care about yourself and maybe this way will help us to reduce this problem with health. We have to help each other. Maybe it sounds crazy but some people believe in karma, and that the bad thing goes away if you can’t do the bad thing. Maybe they are right. Maybe if people were more open to each other and take care about yourself and about each other, this health problem will be reduced.

First of all, modern technology like TV, computers and smart phones can cause some health prombles, if we use them for long time. For example children are in stage of developing and their organies developing are not finished. So, the usage during long periods electronic gadgets will cause problems in eyes and in health in general, because they will have lack of exercise. On the other hand it may be sovled with parent's contvoll in time of usage.
However, I want to underline the idea that modern techology in some area like medicene help us stay in healthy and cope with some illness. For example smart chain helps us check our body if we have some problems with health and gives note what to do. Smart watches are not only used by programms, but its also can check our pulse by mesuaring with magnette dots on it and send information to hospital. Thanks to these technologies doctors can check our health status online and in emergency situation pick up patient to hospital.

Secondly, many psycologists considered this question from different angles and they said that women could be more strong than men and they could be as active as men. Thirdly, if female students are interested in education the universities should not isolate them from the science because it could damage their health.
On the other hand, there are some points that could stop the female activity. For example, the biological differences between women and men are reasonable when it concerns harmfull work. In addition, the education takes a lot of times and women could not have some possibilities to do their personal work at home. Furthermore, the equal number of male and female students in the one subject could provoke different conflicts and it is not good.

We can see enormous amount of young people mostly who spend all time on chatting and surfing in the Internet. As a consequence, these people lose their good view and thus need to wear glasses. Moreover, mobile, computer and TV screen affects our brain and destroys it through our eyes. For instance, I know people who have a frequent headache because of endless looking at their smartphones.

As I have already mentioned, the problem of rising amount of illnesses is hart to solve. However, it is real to reduce these illnesses. Firstly, the young generation is affected by new technologies more than others. So parents should make gaps for their children in using of mobile phones. At the same time, it is better to make kids read books because it’s more useful and developing activity. Secondly, it is necessary to invent harmless screens that would not destroy our eyes.

Moreover, they make you more fashioned, but their essential meaning is protecting, of course.

Some people think that such custumers must be punished. But some suppose that this situation should not be paid attention. To be honest, I support the first group of people.

Firstly, the original discs and legal music, for example, in Itune store are not so expensive. So for ordinary people this money is not so significant. But for musicians and film producers it is a salary for their hard work.
       
Secondly, if this situation will not change in future, the number of crimminals will increase. And society will not follow other laws, too. To add this statement, I want to say that the goverment have to controll such crimminal and make more strictly punishments for them.

Moreover, 2 years ago I saw a documental film about the same crimminals. The main idea of this movie was the fact that if people continiue to download different files, films or music by the Internet, music and movie industry will not make relevant materials and wonderful content of these works. Because they will not have money, which producers pay for creating products.
To emphasize once again, I would like to say that many people suppose that such crimes with illegal downloading products are not so significant. But I strictly know that this is the first step to commiting harder and bigger crimes, which have an unpositive influence on society and on people in it.

There are several reasons for that. First, English language has become the global language, making movies produced by the UK and the USA the most popular. Secondly, movies shot in these two countries usually have big investors, therefore making it possible to produce better quality pictures to attract the lovers of good movies. Thirdly, some of the local producers are not known outside of the area where they work, so people don't think it will later be possible for them to keep a conversation or discussion on the topic of cinema with someone from other country.
Governments all over the world have always invested money to produce films that would reflect certain ideology. In my opinion, it's right that authorities support producers monetary, but they shouldn't tell them what to shoot and what topic should the movie have. First of all, by giving money away government inspires young producers to come up with the idea of a movie that later might become popular. Second of all, as we have seen in Russia with the few governmentally supported films, movies that get funding from the state normally draw bigger attention. Lastly, movies as a form of art has always been used to document certain cultural differences that people have in particular country and that is why it is essential that goverment spends money on making note of these traits of character or historical events that are relevant to local community.
Overall, I think that it is correct for governments to support financially local film producers, as it will make an alternative for British and the US movies that nowadays are too overrated. I should also point out the fact that today there are not enough quality films in Russian cinemas and local industries will benefit from having more money because it creates more jobs and requires getting good education.",70,2,2

Some people see sports as the best option, but many disagree. Let us look closer at this issue. To my mind, providing publicity with affordable sports facilities is a great way to improve physical and, at some point, phychological condition of many people. Doing sports develops your skills, mind and helps to entertain yourself in a healthy manner. There is no lack in evidence of people who are living a happy life doing any kind of sport, from table tennis to parachuting, and who have no health issues. However, many people are not so optimistic about sports. They believe, that these are other factors which help us to stay fit and healthy and say, that some sports (like extreme sports), may be dangerous for your well-being. They consider healthy nutrition, clean ecology, good conditions of living and lack of stresses to be more important and influencing factors. But all of those are controlled by the person him or herself, whereas increasing the number of sports facilities, available for big amounts of people, are the measures, which may be implemented by the governments. So, those, who are willing to try different sports and improve his or her physical-being, can do it and others can turn to the extra ways of staying wealthy. To sum up, I must admit, that it is a personal choice of everybody on how to treat his or her health, but I see doing sports as the essential point of staying in a good fit and mood.

Moreover, the “host country” benefits too. The government collect more taxes. People have waraing places. Almost, one of the advantages of such decision is including of country in modern global economicy, giving impulce to the globalisation. On the other hand the “mother country” of such company have less in taxes. Moreover, it almost last a huge amount of working places elevating the problem of unemployment.

It may seem that it is unfair and pirates should be punished but I do not think that it is the only solution. There are some reasons for my opinion.

At first, legal copes are mostly very expensive so users have not another choice exept download illegal ones. For examle, price of a popular game on the original disc may reach several thousands so teenagers can not afford to buy it just because they have not worked yet.

At second, as the territory of Russia is really large, there are a lot little towns where people can not get neccessary edition so they just download pirate copies. On the other side, there are a huge number of Internet-shops and it is rising gradually so this issue is going to be solved in several years.

To tell the truth, no one is scared of punishment because our legalation is not so developed to cover increasing quantity of problems connecting with the Internet so the solution of pirating problem may not be found in the laws, it should be controlled by morals and ideals.

To conclude, I would like to notice that solution of pirate issue should complex, spreading the legalation, morals, level of life. Only using comprehensive methods we make sharing and downloading pirate content disappear. Without these changes we will never see fair community without illegal sharing of creative products.

Therefore companies all around the world which make any content face problems with illegal spreading their materials. In my terms Internet users can not do any things (including wathing, copying, sharing, buying) with copies

There are some reasons for my point of view: polytical, economical, moral aspects.

First of all, there is one important thing every pirat should know and understand: illegal character of making copies of author’s materials. In many countries the law says about punishment for pirats’ work. Film and music companies, authors and directors do a big work to make a great result. While they want to show it to the audience, the least do not appreciate that intellectual and mechanical work. Such type of behaviour leads to financial problems for companies: they lose their money due to the fact that audience does not want to pay for entertainment. Moreover, it is moral theft: any product of any work should be paied.

Nevertheless, a lot of Internet users have wathed a pirat film at minimum once, I think. I can make a suggestion that they do not have an opportunity to visit the cinema or to by a CD or music fyle in official internet shops. But does it mean that we should become virtual pirats?

To sum up, of course, it is up to concreate person wheather to use illegal copy or not. However, I’d like to make an accent: every result of author’s work should be respected and paied. Thus pirats should be punished.

Indeed, it is terrifying to hear that some school boy did an awful thing. The causes of this social phenomenon are highly arguable, so possible measures. In my perspective, the main causes are living in a highly urbanized areas and being exposed to a lot of stress and temptations. To solve the problem, adults must provide the youth with a clear overview of their opportunities and the ways in which they can reach them.
Living in a highly urbanized cities affects the self-esteem of young people and their perception of the world. They observe different levels of life, namely the great richness and the miserable poverty. They see a lot of products they may want to have themselves, but cannot afford yet. Their peers can lure them to do things they otherwise would not do by suggesting them an easy way to get the products of their desire. This easy way is commiting a crime. Stress may cause the youth to prove themselves to their peers in this way. It strengthens the wish to get what they want righ now.
Although the solution may vary depending on a specific kase, some general ideas can be named. I think it is necessary for parents to clearly state the system of values that they adhere to. They should find a way to make their son or daughter willing to accept it and to share the common values. It is necessary to ensure that the child is not exposed to harmful influence of peer groups. Family values should be at the first place, and any other opinions should be perceived with reference to them. At the same time, teachers at school should provide an overview of possible things an individual could do for living. It can be providing an image of different professions and better under standing of how they may live when they grow. It will give the youth the ways in which they can achieve what they want and will allow to avoid the harmful un certainty which can stimulate them to commit a crime.
To sum up, to lower the crime rate among young people we must provide them with the aims and goals and possible ways in which they can achieve them. This will eliminate the influences of feeling temptations that they are often faced with.

First of all, it should be mentioned that characteristics that we have from our born are researched not in all.

For example there are a lot of researches indicate that people who was born in Asia or in Europe have more abilities than those, who was born in Africa (it’s not some racist argument). Also, our “natural” experience such as DNA for example is an important part of our development. It’s a DNA, that influence on our body, our communicative skills, potential of development, and certain other skills. That’s why it can be sayed that DNA form our personality. But there is another point of view that also can exist, because life experience it’s an important part of our personality. Our society create us, and it’s true. Because our behavior depend of people, that cover us.
To sum up, I can mention that both this points of way can exist and it’s very hard to find same diferent between “natural” ex perience and live experience.

However, there is still a need to solve a lot of problems on the Earth, such as global warming, deforestation, poverty, lack of water and etc. Some people suppose that it is essential to find firstly solutions to issues on the Earth, and only after that explore space, other being the complete opposites to this point of view. This essay aim at discussing which of these ideas seem more reasonable and sensible.
On the one hand, through discovering the space society is able to obtain knowledge abot the Universe and its laws of physics. For instance, it can be fruitful because of the fact that people can implement this knowledge on the Earth in order to invent some new technologies based on what they have found out in the space. Moreover, space exploration can contribute to such fascinating thing as discovering other planets, which are available for life.For example, if someday our planet becomes overpopulated, we will be able to spread the human race on some other planets.
On the other hand, it is estimated that there are a lot of tackling issues on the Earth. For instance, people in developing countries suffer from poverty, in Africa there a lot of villages where there is a lack of drinking water and food. I strongly believe that countries with a good economy should fund money into projects which transport essential goods to the countries with the lack of money.Furthermore, there are a lot of endangered animal on our planet due to such environmantal problems as deforestation, global warming, air pollution and many others. These issues are very urgent and we need to find solutions in order to preserve endangered species.
When both sides of the argument are looked at I would like to emphasize the fact that space exploration being a fruitful field of science still should not be more important for us than solving some economical and environmental urgent issues. If we do not fund projects to solve tackling problems, it will inevitably lead to economical crisis or environmental disaster.",65,2,2

Scientists nowadays have already invented special glasses that help to protect people’s eyes from the negative impact of screens.

In this essay I am going to dwell on this problem and come up with possible solutions to it.

Firstly, young people's behavior strongly depends on their childhood, parents and nurture. It is true that most crimes are committed by teenager who were brought up in bad families and had a very painful childhood. To prevent children from growing up in such circumstances a social program should be envented. The one where a lot of people are eager to help with all they have, who could go to these children's houses and have a long talk with their relatives about parenting and a possibility of giving up a child and send him or her to another family or special house if the parents were proven unworthy.

Another significant cause of such behavior is considered to be peer pressure. Some teenages tend to be depended on other people's opinion and oftenly these people are their classmates or freinds. Even if a child was brought up in a healthy pleasant family his peers could have a great influence on his pr hers perception. To tackle this problem teacher should have special meetings with their students where they could easily explain the kids the rules of the world they are living in and the way they have to bahave if they want to live in peace.

To conclude, bringing up a child is a very seriuos task and people should do it with great responsibility to prevent teenages from committing any crimes and becoming outlaws.",65,2,2

But is it undoubtedly positive? 
One argument is favour of this issue is that children can travel for a year and get acquainted with different cultures. For example, when they go abroad they can easily meet different people and study their customes and traditionals. And also children can broaden their outlook and knowledge. Moreover, having a gap year they can gain experience at work, which can help to be relevant on the labour of market, because the employers support only people who have skills, know ledge and also the experience in the sphere. Furthermore, when child has a year between finishing high school and starting university studies he or she can make a own choice what he or she want in the future career. That is why a year-off is very useful.
However, such experience can have a negative influence on children’s mind. For instance, some children prefer not to work and travel, they want only go for a walk with their friends, relax and have leasure time. So, during some time children become so lazy to have a career or have some future plans. In addition to this, having a gap year children can stop their development and stuck in the routine, so in this case their university study can help to prevent this situation.
To take all the abovementioned into consideration, there are two ways which young people can choose. One the one hand, it is a great opportunity to have a year-off, as you can decide what exactly you want in the future, but on the other hand, you can stop your education and cannot to resist some temtations.

Instead, it is suggested to take care only about own needs and grow exactly as much food, as its population needs. I completely disagree with that point of view, in next paragraphs I will explain my opinion and give reasons.

Firstly, I am totally sure, that a country must use its territories for a maximum usefulness. There are evident pros in taking all that earth can give you. One of them is economical: when a territory ‘works’, it brings a number of vacancies, the more workers you need – the less is unemployment, which is undoubtedly good for economical purposes. What is more, those farmers who don’t produce 100% of what they could, spend waste lands which could be used for infrastructure, buildings, cultural means, etc.

Secondly, we should not forget about natural disasters and other unpredictable circumstances. If the government limits the amount of produced food, as flooding or just bad weather is likely to spoil a significant percent of harvest, leaving population suffering from deficite.

Third reason against mentioned policy seems to be psychological. We should help our neighbours as much as we can and one day they’ll help us in their turn. In critical situations it is possible to send aids and food for those countries who suffer more for free. In my opinion we all are humans and we must not forget about other humans: if we do, we will not be better than animals.

Some people say, that producing extras seems to lead to additional spends, which can be harmful for economics. There is a point, but but if a government suggests good balanced policy, incomes from import will overweight extra costs.

In conclusion, I would like to mention, that my opinion is not professional, nevertheless, there are no reasons for reducing import as much as possible. With a proper budget planning and well-made policy our country will gain much profit from producing extra food. That is why import is preferable for me.

This provides us with execellent oppurtunities to learn more, to explore more and to unite by means of investigating in our future. However, I'd like to agree that the statement given has something to do with the reality and some kinds of space-exploring activities seem to be not so clear.

Staying at the track of contraversary, I would like to introduce the reasons why certain kind of space exploration really appears to be some kind of a waste. I'm mostly speaking of kind of entertainment in space. Such an idea is building an orbiting hotel in space which, in my opinion, leads the chart of stupidity. Merely one would list reasons for such kind of enormous investment. Such waste becomes actually disgusting when taking into account such downearth problems as poverty, hunger, ecology and inequality. I tend to think that huge investment needs to be backed up with the reality and the key point is that such kind of investment is obliged to be atleast useful not speaking of effectiveness.

With the cons mentioned, it is the point to move to pros. As I've already mentioned, space exploration appears to be a leading power for human progress of enormous strength. Exploring space may lead to inventing tons of different things we are everyday in need for. For example inventing new kinds of meds, new sources of energy, recieving some explanations of how the life works on our planet. So, basically, by investing into scientific cosmos exploration we are to move forward in our progress which, as for me, would undoubtedly lead to increase of the quality of life. And improving overall quality of life is another crucial feature of scientific space investment especially when speaking of much important downearth I've mentioned above. The majority of such problems could be solved by means of improving quality of life or for example inventing new energy sources.

To sum everything up, I tend to somehow agree with the statement given in terms of the reasons of space exploration and it's relevance for downearth reality. That is to say, that we are to carefully take into account our needs and abilities before entering the space and spending insane sum of money. We are to focus on whats relevant for today and hence we are to invest in such fields and, as for me, scientific space exploration is an excellent opportunity for reaching our goals, mostly, for progressing and improving the quality of life.",70,2,2

People's homes are robbed, many women get mugged. These kinds of things are certainly not happening without a cause. Economical crisises, wars, politcal conflicts. All of them make people turn into criminals, even the youngest ones. The crime rates amongst young adults is getting higher and higher each single day. But why does it happen?

Well, one good reason for that is certainly different types of conflicts or happenings, which affect people on a global scale. If we remeber the fall of the Soviet Union for instance, we can certainly recall a lot of stories about different gangs and notorius criminals, which ravaged the country. Back then It was hard to support yourself and crime was the only way out even for teenagers. Secondly, It can certainly be different psychological factors such as peer pressure. Youngsters can be certainly persuaded to take part in criminal activity If the offer is alluring.

All the information above sounds horrible, but what can we do about this? There's no precise answer out there,because every young man or woman has his or hers reasons for commiting crimes. The only good thing that parents and teachers can do, is to cultivate strong will in then and try to teach them critical thinking, so they would understand how doing ""bad"" things may affect the society and the country they are living in. But even my methods are a topic for a very huge debate. Times change and people too, so It's hard to tell if there will ever be a perfect solution.",70,2,2

I can not fully agree with that.
First of all, I can base my point on my own life experience. I have faced a number of situations when I knew a person in childhood and was friends with him or her. But then our communication came to an end and we did not see each other for a few years. And once I met this person occasionally again and had a conversation with him or her. I could see that the person had changed a lot. A lot had happened in his or her life and that had led to vivid changes in his or her personality and behaviour.
Secondly, I can also prove my opinion on psychological studies. A great philosopher John Lock is famous for his work on studying people’s behaviour. In one of his works he proved that a new born person is “a clear board” on which you can draw anything you like.
Last but not least, are various book and film stories which show a person that was born, for instance, in a royal family and was supposed to become a noble, well-educated person. But under some circumstances that person had to live a life of a peasant and that influenced on the forming of his personality.
Taking everything into account, I will state my point of view once again: a person’s development depends on the conditions he or she is put in and what experience he or she has to go through during his lifetime.

It is now on the level it has never been before and it keeps rising, what can be done to prevent this from happening?
First of all, children are not aggressive from their birth. Aggression and having thoughts of committing crimes comes from the period of socialization. Nowadays, parents cannot limit their kids from everything, it is inappropriate to not let their children to watch TV, meet up with friends, go to the school etc. In some countries it is against the law and there is actually no need to restrict all those things but reason why many serial killers become serial killers is their period of socialization, same goes for many types of crimes.
Second thing that comes in mind, when thinking about what are the causes of such rise in crime commitment is influence of the internet. Teenagers have access to gigantic library called ‘’World web” but at the same time they may find so much information which will not benefit them in any way, only make the worse. Information about guns, drugs, videos of murders, school shootings, child porn all that may be found in the internet there is no censorship by the government or IT provider. One more thing to mention is violent video games in which killing, using drugs and many other illegal things are considered as “cool”.
What can be done to prevent many things that are mentioned above? School education should consist of teaching teenagers the law and why they should respect the law. In some cases it is already being taught in schools but obviously that is not enough. Parent’s duty is to provide their children with all the information needed in their period of growth to successfully socialize, nevertheless internet access should be censored and popular social network should also create and update their own system of censorship for teenagers.
All things considered, if our young generation would be better taught and they would be restricted from negative influence, the percentage of crime would have decreased overall and there would have been a drastic fall in young adults’ crime commitment.",60,2,2

We cannot say what happiness is because it is not even an emotion. It is more state of mind or soul. So, when we try to catch and identify it, we can loose it.
One more thing which makes the idetifying of happiness more complicated is that everyone have their own happiness. Some people feel happy when they succeed in something. Other, when they do business that they like. While others, when they enjoy their time with family or friends. Furthermore, everyone can be bored with the thing that made him happy before and  they will have to seek for another one. There are plenty  things that can make a person happy.

Also, they do not have enough free time such as vacation or something like this. For example, my mother work in office during the year and her sheff does not give time to relax for long time. Let’s consider some causes of this problem. Children start to spend more time siting in the Internet, due to this fact their eyes become worth. Also, they start to study badly without parent’s controlling. Moreover, and the most awful thing is that children can keep in touch with bad society get some injures and start to do awful things.

Actually, there is a number of reasons for this issue. First  and foremost, it is clearly, that every single person living in a modern realities has his or her own smartphone. Nowadays scientists strongly believe that mobile phones can make a huge damage to human’s heath-rhythm and eyesight. Secondly, logisty say that a permanent opportunity to get any kind of information you want causes many problems. For example with nerves and human’s phsychology in general. Another major reason is the fact that the level of traffic in modern cities is highly increased. This causes air pollution, which is also destroying for human’s health. Some researches say that nowadays ozone layer is already damaged so much, that we can’t even recover it. 

Nevertheless, there are some ways humanity could use to resolve these issues. Firstly, we can rearrange transporting use as more environmentally-friendly. For example, international transportations could make their transporting by using electric transport. Trains nowadays are as fast as cars or ships. This kind of transport is not wedespreaded because of the borders and the laws. I guess, governments should think about ecology and open borders for the international railway connection. Another thing that can be done to reduce technology damage on our health is try to face less mobile phone or a computer in your everyday life. You might use your phone only for connecting people and a compute only for work issues, for instance.

To summarise, I would like to say that influence of widespread technology on our health is not just technologies imperfectane fault. Personally, I think that it is our own choise. To ger pleasure and comfort by using our gadgets and have some problems with health or to have a great healthy body, but say ‘no’ to using technologies for your pleasure.

Also, many authorities suggest to make the less amount of our travels. I am completely agree with this position, because the airplanes throw a lot of gases to the Earth atmosphere.
Today our population has a lot of types of transport; for example: cars, buses, trolleybuses, metro, air planes and others. But in my opinion, airplanes are more dangerous for ecology that other one. Airships fly for a long distances with big speed. And when ships are flying, they throw a great amount of dangerous fuel things to the atmosphere. Nevertheless to their high speed and comfort, airplanes can contribute not only air pollution, but global warming too. As for reseachers opinions, a great amount of airplane travels isn’t necessary for people. And many scientists ask a question: what should we do with this situation?
A lot of authorities suppose that it is simple to write the rules and laws, which will protect a big amount of travels. But as for me, this solution won’t be effective. Every year, people are travelling to different places for the relaxing and for the business deals. It won’t reduce this issue at all. Moreover, the new problem will appear: many countries will have a poor income of transport services.
In conclusion, I want to say that our atmosphere is not a rubbish cabin. Our population should save it for future generations. And if Governments reduce the amount of air travels, it will not help to save the nature. In my opinion, we should do more actual solutions, for instance: push rubbish into cabins, some water, forests, don’t pollute air with help of smoking and other. And after that, the problem of global warming will disappear.

Some people believe that air carries are responsible for air pollution more than car owners and factories and governments should take measures to reduce their harm to the atmosphere. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion.

First of all, there is a huge demand in air travels. There are a lot of aims air carries can help to reach from private needs like desire of holidays or want to visit relatives to delievery of goods from another part of the world. Obviously, it is impossible to decrease the number of air travels.

Moreover, greater contribution to air pollution and global warming lies in car owners and factories hands. Every day people themselves destroy atmosphere using private transport instead of public. It should be noticed that in modern world a lot of families have two and more cars for each family member. Therefore, there is a huge air polluting effect produced by ouselves. What is more, there is no need to discuss about responsibility of factories for damaging atmosphere.

In addition, there are not so many rich people in the World who can afford using their own flights. Thus, I cannot agree that a lot of air travel is unnecessary as private flights are only one of some hundreds of public ones.

In conclusion, there are some other spheres to control by governments but air travels. Everyday human's actions can make a greater input in destroying atmosphere and causing global warming. Therefore, governments should focus on creating laws to control people's usage of private transport and factories' pullings in rivers and air instead of reducing the amount of air travels used.

Some people believe that such sports-men should be excluded from professional competition for a limited period of time. Other suppose that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from professional competitions for the rest of their lives.
As for me, I agree with the first opinion, which stands for limited banning of athletes. First of all, the rules are constantly changing and the drugs that were legal yesterday can become illegal tomorrow. Unfortunately, not all the athletes may know immediately about new regulations and, as a result, they won't stop using the newly forbidden drug. 
Secondly, I believe that we must give athletes second chance, because they spent so much time of their lives and so much effort, training and practicing, that one mistake should not be the end of their career.
However, some people claim that athletes accused in taking illegal drugs must be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their lives. Such people believe that cheating with the help of forbidden drugs is not worthy of real athlete, who respects rules of sports competition and has dignity of their own. Although, they suppose that such severe punishment would prevent other sportmen from using illegal drugs. 
Nevertheless, I think that banning the athlete from competitions for the rest of their lives is too severe punishment. The eternal banning won't stop other athletes from cheating, they will just start to use more sophisticated methods of cheating, using new drugs. Moreover, such punishment will close the door to sport for all falsely accused sportsmen. And if athlete is really used illegal drug, knowing about it, he or she won't be able to learn from their mistakes and become a good example of correcting their behavior.
Ultimately, the topic of punishment for athletes using illegal drugs is very debatable. I believe that we should not ban sportsmen for the rest of their lives, because it is too strict punishment. I suppose that we should give everyone a second chance.

There are two view on this problem. Some people think that the athlets who use illegal drugs shouldn't participate in competion during some period of time, the opponents insists that using of drugs should be punished more radically, so the athlets should be banned forever.
On the other hand, the first idea is based on humanity. Everyone can make a mistake even an athlet. But it seems that this measure will work only if the sportsmen really appologise for his action. If he do not he will use drugs in future more carafully and we have a negative influence on a copetition.
That is why for the another hand, the eternal ban will be better. It will protect all pure athlets. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages in this method, because it do not include the mistake of RUADA or other antidopping organisations. And not even the career of a good athlet can be ruin after such mistakes, but also the sport in country where he came from.
Taking everything into considaration, we can say that there are some advantages and disadvantages of this two measures of antidopping companies. But I believe that the first one is better because it can really resolve a problem with less harm for everyone.

They exist through the period of our civilization develpment. Their skills and non-standard mental activity create our cultural history. I allmastly agree thet creative artists should have freedom for their activity. 
First of all, creative artists are not just musicals or poets: there are some philosophers too. It is a kind of  people who create an idea. Every new point of view, new emotion or something out of the box is the product which would have influence to people's mind, their opinion, it's the part of a progress. The idea is the reason of inner intention for future acts. Artists may reflect the live of society on their pictures, films or say something, which is not the thing which government want to see. 
We should give creative people as much freedom as we can because the art can talk to people in one language without any words at all. Some artists are famous and every their word make sence for the people because of the same points of view, feelings and emotions. For example, philosophers can generate an ideology of the contry, start the war of stop it. They don't have need to menage the crowd by any agressive methods, but their main advantage is that they have influence on our minds. 
To sum up all of this, I should say that there is no need to take over control creative people. The imagination and individuality is the important thing of oiur history, which should be controlled only by people moral and maybe negative reaction for some things which are unormal for time and mentality of nation.

I think, that this strategy can help upgrade economical situation in some countries. But I have one disagreement. As for me, any country must produce the food for import and not in small values, cause it support to nation get more money. Let me talk about it.

Firstly, yeah, it’s very wonderful to produce products that their own population eats. This thing must split all of of countries. It isn’t interesting, when you can eat everything everywhere. All nations will be different. By the way, we can place some markets of cafes with international food, but reduce their own. And countries can reduce spending money on ‘unpopular’ food in current place.

In other way of thinking, countries must not produce the food only for their population. Everyone must produce products for import, cause it so comfortable and cool to get money from other nations, that are interesting in ‘kitchen’ of your homeside. But count of that food must be normal, not little, not huge. That move helps us upgrade economical situation in any country. It help to upgrade life level in some nations in Africa and in south America.

As clearly seen, this statement not so correct, as for me. And I think, that there is kind of interesting idea, but I’ll correct some ‘mistakes’ there. It is so interesting to split countries in that way, but we must know, that import – one huge part of any country and everyone must keep it on mide.

In past we had only few main kinds of art: music, art, literature, arhitecture, theatre, and, probably, the clothes. But now there are new types of art: films, photography, excebitions. Thanks to new technologies films consist more special effects, music became more electronic and simple photos with views of nature (which can do any kid) are admitted like an art of high level. World become free: there are few wars, more gays and lesbians. And what about art? Is it more freedom in culture expression and expression of different individuals? And is it good or not?
Well, in my point of view, artists can have a freedom. The first, as I said earlier, today the world is more free. The second - art is expression of culture, the whole word and the current period of time. If we sum up these two sentenses, we can say that the artnowadays should reflect the freedom and governments can't be against it.
Furthermore, to my mind, art that made by modern creative artists, can tribute to the freedom. For example, concerts of famous singers like Madona and Lady Gaga are have a message, that world should become more free, that there shouldn't be some wars, that people with anothe sex orientation shouldn't be judged etc. I believe, that when young people listen their songs and visit and see their concerts, they become inspired and make the world better by little things.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that politics should allow to creative artists to do what they want to do and make an art in the way they want to see it. And if it bad for children physic - it is a problem of parents.

At first it is illigal. When you make copies of film or a music without author’s permission - you can be punished. Every pearson who has rights on his intellectual property can provide you a lisence. The lisence can be printed on the product, for examle, on a disk-box. In Internet, you buy this product from official distrybutor.

But on the other hand, there is no controll in Internet and everybody can use stolen videos for free. The problem is that a huge amount of people do not know the law and do not wat research which film was stolen and which film was downloaded for free by its owner.

Secondly, people may be punished for damaging whole musical or cinematography industry. Every stolen cent can be critial for some music bands, every copy can seriosly harm people, who create movie. It is very serious problem and it affects media business.

It is common knowledge that computers are unsubstitutional in work and everyday life nowadays. But do we remember that it can be harmful for us? Working by the computers causes many dangerous health problems. The most dangerous of them are eyes problems caused by looking into monitor for a long time and illnesses connected with the sitting lifestyle! For example, according to World Healthcare Organization research, more than half of the working population of the developed countries has health problems caused by working sitting in front of computer.
However, there are some simple ways to stop the developing of such health problems in our body. It is thought by medicals that ""the computer workers"" must stop their working every 45 or 60 minutes for a short break during which it is recommended to look far away and to do some eye gymnastics. To prevent or reduce sitting lifestyle problems it is good to do sports or heal gymnastics at least once or twice a week.
It is wrong to not say about some theories about other harmful modern technologies. Some people say that it is dangerous to use mobile phone or microwave oven or something like that. But, unfortunately, today there no science researches proving it.
Concluding all of the above, it is possible to say that there are indeed some health proplems caused by modern technologies, but we can prevent them with our activity.

On the one hand, improving the number of sport facilities will influence on public health because a lot of problems could been solved if people change their lifestyle to better one, because the one problem is caused by another one.

But this may has its own pros and cons.
On the one hand, students have an opportunity to relax from their hard work and exams at school. Moreover, it is a great chance to get away from it all, to broaden horizons, to see new sights and explore new places. It is also an exellent opportunity to feel independant travelling by your own. In addition, it can be a mainstream for young peole to meet new friends and practise foreign languages with them. However, students may spend their year with the use for themselves, working for some organisation. It can be worth mentioned that the work experience is more rital today than an educational grade.
On the other hand, the studying process at university is also an important part in humans' life. Nodoubteally, such students mits a social side of education at university. Moreover, some special skills and the main knowledge can be forgotten during their year. By the way, studying with elder people is also a social problem which leads sometimes to missunderstanding. So many young people take as rool that as soon they finish their university studies as soon they start working, travelling and doing everything they want.

As it is for the manufactured goods, the percentage is higher in the second chart: 28%, as for the rail it is 25%. A great difference can be noticed in the transportation of machinery and food products. It is clear from the graphs that the most comfortable way of transporting machinery is by rail (12%). At the same time, it is not a good way of transporting foods: only 11% of food products are transported by rail, when by food the percentage gets to 30%.

A closer look to the graph helps to understand that for the transportation of chemicals rails and roads are used nearly the same: 11% and 16% respectively. But when it comes to the non-metallic minerals, people from Eastern Europe have more trust in the road transportation (13%).

Moreover, it can hurt to world's culture. Secondly internet becomes very pooular nowadays and any artist can loud their creation in this global network. So government wil not disturb to  it. Thirdly, artists show us other worlds, romantic stories, beautiful landscapes, which we can not see around us. And I think it is great. 
But there is another point of view. Some people are absolutely sure that freedom in different arts is very dangerous. They believe that music and films often hurt to children's mind and change it for their ideology. So government don't allow to appear on TV and internet a lot of dangerous product of arts and these people think that it is right. I don't agree with them. People have right to see all they want and government must not do any restrictions on it.

Although, is some universities’ groups boys and girls are divided unequally. To my mind, groups should be formed by equal number of male and female as it can have an affect on students life and their future.
To start with, the youth should communicate with the opposite sex since they will not have problems with it in the future. It is a widespread fact that persons who are too shy while studying at university are less likely to become friends with each other and get married. Following that, the division of boys and girls in groups is benefitial to the studying process. For example, a lot of seminar classes are based on pair work and tutors do all their best to form pairs of boys and girls with the aim of their better communication and understanding each other. Finally, as a result of two previous arguments, the relationship between students incide the group will be stronger since they become more able to help, and to respect other students.
However, there can be some problems in such groups. For instance, people believe that only woman can understand another woman. Moreover, boys in the youth are unable to have good relationship with groupmates. espesially with girls.
Taking everything into account, I can say that I am fully agree with the idea of equal number of men and women in the group at university, because it is an experience everyone should get while people are young and study together.

In my opinion, this tendention is due to growing ambitions of the youth as well as the lack of attention from their parents and teachers. The way to solve this problem is to use the individual approach for each young man or woman.
In modern world we can hear a lot of stories about people who started from the bottom and became very famous or rich. However, not every young man can interprete these facts correctly. They don't understand that these successful people did the great amount of work and they can hear only phrases from them like everybody can do that, so they start to seek for ""easy money"".
The youth ambitions must be restricted by their parents and teachers. But actually, parents devote their lives to the career nowadays more frequently than ever before. They think that it's teachers' duty to watch after their childrens' minds. However teachers also tend to more the responsibility to the parents, and in this situation nobody is right.
The individual approach to every single teenager is needed. Parents mustn't think that it is normal for a young man to be a bit aggressive, proud and ambitious and when they grow up, everything will be OK. They must look at their child not as at a representative teenager but as at an individual with his own life experience and problems. Teachers also shall not close their eyes to the features of individual's character. Because of their profession, they have to work with thousants of young men and they can't precisely say who will be the criminal tomorrow.
Every crime of the young man is the combination of two factors: their ambitions and inappropriate treatment by their parents and teachers. Both factors can be controlled if they forget about the statistics and would use an individual approach for each young person.

Firstly, usually  both parents should go out for working because of financial problems. It is very hard to grow up children and have family because all goods, education, medicine have high costs. Secondly, women nowadays are trying to become independent , work as men and realise yourselves in life. Communication with parents and spending time with them are the essential part of progressive growing up for child. The lack of them can have influence on their future life. Parents should pay attention on their child, love, give knowledge and take care. Otherwise, child will feel yourself uncomfortable, not needed and unhappy. These feelings can destroy his dreams and believe in yourself. Moreover, children can have negative information from harmful people and nobody can not help.

Actually the most musicians earn money nowadays by playing live concerts which fans visit anyway – no matter whether they have records of the last album or not. The most part of film makers’ salary contains of money recieved by them from the cinemas, not from selling copies of the film for home watching. The lose of money because of pirates is not so great as it seems to be. There is a lot of ways to encourage the author of a song or of a film you like. On the one hand, if you first buy and you are able to listen or to watch, you cannot say beforehand that you will like it. For people it were more reasonable first to try (to download a free copy) and then to donate to the author if the film or the song is really good. On the other hand, a lot of people like to use free copies of their favorite films and music pieces without any donation to the authors. Pirates uploaded these files to the internet but is using it honest?

People from 16 to 24 show spend more time doing sport than people of any other ages (282.1 minutes for men and 114.1 minutes for women). Than there is a considerable decrease: males from 25 to 34 spend 153.8 minutes and females spend 92.8. The oldest people (from 75) spend the least time exercising: 29.2 minutes for males and 10 minutes for females. 	The second trend shown by this chart is the fact that, in general, males spend more time doing sport than females. For example, men from 35 to 44 spend 120.6 minutes exercising while women only 92.8. However this trend is most representative only in extreme positions. For people between 16 and 24 and people from 75 the difference in time spent doing sport between males and females is almost three times, while for people from 55 to 74 this difference is not that dramatic (females between 55 and 64 spend even slightly more time doing sport that males: 52.7 for men and 55.4 for women).",65,1,0

The essay will discuss firstly, the problems that are connected with health, and, secondly, the solutions which can decide these problems
To begin with, the most significant problem connected with the use of technology is hat the ultraviolette destroys the humans' immune system. For example, if a person is sitting with the computer for the whole day and playing some games, or sitting on the Internet, then he/she will have a headache, the vision will be much worse. Moreover, there is a problem with radiation. For example, the phones which people use or the electronic resources, where they bake can also bring a harm on health. The radiation can increase the number of such deases as cancer.
To reduce such problems the scietists and innovators should get them into the account. Firstly, they should produce such technologies that will have much less raiation, that will not be so harmful for people's health. Secondly, they have to get in an account that people spend a lot of time with these technologies, for example, phone. Thirdly, people should put some rules in using such technologies theirselves, because nobody will follow for them and that technologies they use. And finally, the government have to put some patents on the most harmful technologies.
To conclude, there are a lot of technologies that harm people's health, but this problem can be reduced.

On the one hand, people who require to introduce laws to limit air travel are right too. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that planes indeed produce much pollution and cause global warming. There are many interesting and disappointing researches on this theme.  Secondly, there are really a lot of air trips which are not necessary for people but people allow themselves it because of law prices in flights. Such prices increase the amount of flights and, unfortunately, the quantity of air crashes are rising too. On the contrary, afordable air travel results in many benefits. For example, despite the rising number of air crashes it remains the safest transport. Also people save much time travelling by planes. In addition, air travel supports business very much and it leads to the GDP growth of countries, and it can help people to integrate and to invent new planes which would be faster and use less petrol, for instance.

Others suppose that we can find more productive and better ways of decreasing crime. Here I would like to write about the problem of reducing crime and give my opinion about it. Many people think that the best way of reducing crime is to give longer prison sentences. They think so because there are many cases when prisoners become really different person in a better way after a long sentence. They become better because they have more time to think about what they have done, they try their best to become a new person with a new life. Also, long prison sentences are good because there are such persons who can't live in a normal world with laws and morals. So it will be better for all if this kind of prisoners stayed in prisons for a long time. However, there are people who believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime. They think in such way because now psyhologists have many different unique methods that can help prisoners to become better even without longer sentences. Such methods can be more resultful because prisoners will have a chance to change their thoughts and find solutions of their problemps with the help of specialits. Also, there are prisons in which prisoners are not living in a routine thinking about ways to escape. For example, there is a prison in Phillipines in which prisoners dance instead of simple walks. In this prison the most dangerous prisoners are becoming more peacefull and friendly. In conclusion, I would like to write that I think that such ways of changing people in prisons like in Phillipines are more succesful and probaply it will really reduce crime rates in the future.",65,2,0

Some people claim that those athlets who do it, have to be forbidded to take part in the competitions for some time, while others believe that such people should be banned forever. In the following essay I will examine both points of view and express my personal opinion.
It is certainly the case that in present times the development of chemistry and pharmacy has made various kinds of drugs availible in the market. Most of them are, of course, illegal for the use of sportsmen. However, very often some drug is put into the category of forbidden only after some precedent has occured. It means that an athlete could take it without knowing he isn't supposed to, but still he can be punished for doing it. Some people might argue that, saying that a person has to be perfectly aware of the list of banned components in drugs, nevertheless, I am convinced that new rules appear every day and they are quite hard to be predicted. That is why I find that limiting sportsmen for their whole lives is unfair.
What is more, I find such kind of punishment to be too harsh. All people make mistakes in their lives and everybody deserves forgiveness and a second chance. Thus, very often a person who is left without an opportunity to return to his career in some period of time falls into depression and finds it hard to recover. I strongly believe that a 1-5 year period is enough for an athlete to realize what he has done and not do this ever again. My opponents may object, claiming that illegal drugs usage in professional sport is a very serious crime and people who are convinced of it must take their punishment, however I find that it is a simple cheating which certainly can be forgiven.
Nevertheless, it must be true to say that everything depends on a particular situation. For instance, if an athlete has already been accused of taking illegal drugs before or if he takes part in some extremelly famous world competition and breaks this ground rules, the punishment might be heavier. Although I can agree that due to these or other circumstances a person can be resticted from competing, I still don't think that he or her should be banned forever. 
To conclude, it is evident that this issue appears to be highly controversial. A lot of people see illegal drugs usage in sport as a crime of a major importance. Others, on the contrary, find it not so serious. In my personal opinion, some measures of punishment must exist, however, they shouldn't be so significant.

I am not agreeing with this statement. Of course, young people commit crimes, but, first of all, not all teenagers do that. There are a lot of people from different bands or gipsy, who have not their own family and house and they just should alive. That is why they started committing crimes.
Secondly, these crimes, which are committed by young people, are not serious, nothing more than stealing for their pocket money. Often, they do that just for fun. The real crimes like murders are committed by adults, who are learning how to commit crime by several years.

In my opinion, the only people who could solve this problem are parents. Children just want some attention from them and sometimes when teenagers couldn't accept that, they started doing all that things like stealing in shops, cheating and others.

Moreover, nowadays we use our mobile phones all days round. So, they have become a real drug for people, whose even do not understand what negative effect their gadjets have.

It is obvious that transportation of manufactured goods is nearly the same by both of these means, 12% of machinery is transported by rail, and only 2% by road. The most striking fact is that less transported goods by rail are non-metallic minerals and machinery by road.

Some people strongly believe that air travel for business and leisure should be almost prohibited due to ecological reasons. However, I think that this measure will not solve the problem so easily.

First of all, there is still no alternative to the planes. People created fast ships and trains, but none of them can be compared to usual passenger airplane. The are some insurmountable obstacles with using, for example, cars. They are expensive and even more polluting, because gasoline is much more dangerous for the atmosphere than kerasine. Moreover, chance to get into accident is million times larger than while air travel, and this fact is proven by statistics.

Secondly, there are many things that government can do for saving the Earth. Take, for instance, the idea of making investments into development of more ecologically safe means of transportation. Goverments can restrict the taxes policy for air companies in order to get more money and build sun batteries and other fuel free sources of energy.

Some people think that flying by plane is not necessary, because it is always possible to find an alternative way of travelling. I cannot agree with that statement, because it can take weeks to travel from the one point to another. It is clear that time is the most expensive and valuable resource in people's lives. Just imagine: flight from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk takes 4,5 hours, while travelling there by train takes more than 4 days. Obviously, it can be really hard for children and elder ones, especially in summer time.

In conclusion I should say that despite other people's opinion I continue to believe that air travel is the safest and quickest one. Moreover, some ecological troubles that air planes cause can be easily overcomed with the help pf governments.

I think, that there are a lot of other reasons for air pollution and global warming, air travelling is only one puzzle of all picture. And we should seach the other way to cope with its problem, but introduction laws to reduce the amount of using airbuses is not suitable for modern society. First of all, airbuses are the most convenient, cheapest and fasten kind of transport. And if governments introduce laws that reduce the number of air travel for business and leisure, it could cause social disaster, “bum” among people. The history gives us a lot of examples of radical reforms and many of them leaded to awful consequences. Moreover, there are a lot manufactories, factories that provide all kinds of pollution more than other things. I mean a great number of waste, toxic components of their technologies. And there are a lot of examples when owners of these factories do not buy necessary equipment that can help to avoid ecological problems. And scientists did many researches in this area and said that airzoles which are using in our everyday life all over the world contribute a great to air pollution (about 15% according to the results of researches). To sum up, I want to say that, of course, using airbuses a lot of time has its drawbacks and has a negative influence.

Of course, situation when people eat products that produced on own plantations is good for the costs of this items. People do not pay more, because in this situation costa not include pay for delivery and many other taxs. Moreover, live without import products helps people in these countries be a sure in next day.

However, many countries do not have some resources on their territory. For example, many countries do not have oil or gas. But many of these countries have rice, salt, sugar, vegetables or other products. It is the basis of international economic. If countries will not change resources, then life each of us will be bad and worry. Because process of change resources is one of the most important for each government.

To begin with, some people do not consider the growth of sports facilities value to be a solution of the problem. They suppose that innovations in medical sphere would give much more benefits. However, medical improvement will not be as productive as improvement in sports, since the cost are too large.
Moreover, boom in the number of sports equipment will lead to increase of physical activity attractiveness because a great deal of people want to take up playing some sports game but they just  do not have a possibility to do it. In addition, doing sports with friends will promote social relationship and vice versa, since doing sport together is a great pleasure. What is more, large amount of people will be motivated by the possibility of improving their own body, making it more attractive and stronger. The aspect of sport culture also must be taken in to consideration because it contains such notions as refusing from junk food, giving up smoking and others. This way of thinking will obviously have a positive effect on health of every person.
To conclude, rise in the amount of sport equipment will certainly cause improvement of health. This innovation will be beneficial for our society.

Nowadays, it is believed that it is better not to start university studying immediately after finishing school but to have a gap year in order to travel or to work. There are some drawbacks and advantages.
First of all, a free time between school and university spent, for example, travelling all over the world or working in some company or factory is a great opportunity not only to see some beautiful holiday destinations in a tropical country or accustoming to a working place, but also a wonderful time to cultivate tolerance to other cultures and traditions. The importance of such a necessary skill as being tolerant and understanding person cannot be underestimated in our fast-changing and cruel world. So, a gap year can help you in becoming a person of a great moral categories, such as kidness, warm-heartedness and flexibility in terms of intercultural communication.  
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. Unfortunately, a year spent somewhere abroad or travelling inside your own country, working or so on, can easily deprive you of your home. People having a gap year are very likely to feel homesick. It will lead to demotivation some way. So it is a great risk to be disappointed. What is more, in case you are travelling to countries with different languages and religions, a large number of misadertandings will take place. Some culture barriers will prevent you from being open to other people, in case you are not prepared to be a quick-thinking and light-hearted person.
To sum it up,  having a gap year has both advantages and disadvantages and it is absolutely up to a person to decide whether to do so or not, because it is all depends on mental abilities and a cultural background of up bringing.

The huge number of different companies exist in our modern world. Every year a lot of companies open their businesses all over the globe. Some companies are international and owners of these companies develop their business in different countries that could be poor. On the one hand, this process will help to develop these countries, because some countries have no jobs for native people. If one person finds a good job with big salary, it will help its family. I suppose that children will be able to go to school with better education these people will be able to buy some good drugs in pharmacies and good food. An economic of these countries will increase. Conditions for life will become better. Companies that will open their businesses in poor countries also will have some benefits. The first is an increase of staff. The second is an  increase of consumers all over the world. The third is that companies will become more famous. The fourth it is cheap. On the other hand, people in these countries mostly poo and they won’t be able to buy something and maybe these items aren’t need them. So it could have a negative effect. Sometimes developing countries have no need to have foreign companies on their territorial places. In conclusion, in my opinion, the opening businesses in poor countries has more advantages than disadvantages because these countries will have new opportunities to develop. The owners of these companies also will be able to produce more items than before.

Due to the huge influence of these sites on the society some people argue that they should provide educational content, while others claim that their aim is to entertain. In this essay I will cover both points of view and give my opinion. On the one hand, the necessity to share knowledge via social media sites is undoubtable. These days almost everyone in developed countries has an access to the Internet and frequently visit social networks. Thus, instead of wasting leisure time on useless pictures and videos people can develop their minds reading or listening, for instance, lectures. Another argument the supporters of this idea use is that a considerable part of social media users are children and teenagers. As a result, it would be helpful for them not to get distracted from the process of education by jokes but to know something new that will be useful for them in real time. On the other hand, social media are an important resource that helps people who have worked or studied all day relax and forget about little problems. Indeed, there people are tired from their daily routine and to continue get knowledge after a hard day. One more argument in favor of this point of view includes the idea that there is a freedom of choice on these websites. Unlike television, where it is impossible to watch a favourite show of the convenient time, social media sites visitors are generally able to choose the option they want. All things considered, there are a plenty of strong arguments supporters of opposing opinions provide. Having said this, I am included to think that both points of view are reasonable and the only remedy is to combine informational and entertaining content of social media sites.

In my opinion, this policy has more advantages that disadvantages. In my essay, I will try to prove my suggestion. First of all, for people living in any developed country there are more opportunities to be hired, to find the job. That is why sometimes a significant number of companies should wait until an employee wants to join the group. However, by moving the businesses to poorer countries, these international companies will be able to hire workers sooner because these people need any work. Moreover, these companies can also paid them a little less thus increasing the profit. On the other hand, thanks to this policy, managers will have an opportunity to find unique workers who may be do not have any diploma of higher education; however, they can be creative and have some essential for the companies skills. For example, the person from the any developing countries of Africa can create the jewerly collection inspired the culture of his own country. And then these products may be sold in America. Moreover, if we want to save our word and live in peaceful place, we should help poorer countries to survive. By moving their business, international companies can save people from the hunger, give them a chance to live happily.   To sum up, there is a considerable number of advantages for international companies to move their businesses to poorer countries. In this case, they will be able to give people work, to launch new products, sometimes to reduce costs and increase benefits, and what is important to help different people live in a happy word.  ",65,2,0

On the other hand, there are another measures of improving health. Firstly, government should deny genetically modified products, which cause affects on organism.

If we compare changes that will probably take place in the future (2050), than one thing is being noticed pretty well: number of people aged sixty and more will be rising till time in both countries. Here's a probable explanation for such kind of phenomena: science (especially biology and medicine) researches will finally lead mankind to externed life length.

Easy example, one film, which is called Mister Nobody, fall down in social consumering and producer has not been spending money for other movies of this film director. But, it loses not because of bad work, but because of burgluras and pirats. They stole this product of art. That’s why they must be punished.

This situation may cause worries among local film productions, as movies they make often don't get a lot of popularity. Some people believe that governments should financially support local movie industries. I totally agree with this point of view.

First of all, people's choice is caused by a lot of different factors, if some movie is getting more popular than others, it probably means that it has better video and audio effects, visual picture is more entertaining or the plot better catches attention of the person watching the movie. However,there are a lot of movies which made huge sums of money just by using better commercial methods. Such films become popular before they are even available to watch. People wait for them and go to see them, even though they don't always get positive reviews. At the same time a local film can be totally ignored by people just because producers don't have enough money to advertise it. Financial support from the government can help solve this problem and give a chance to really good films made by small movie companies.

Moreover, it is important to support and develop culture of each country. At the age of the Internet things become easier to find, it means both that people from other countries can see movies from America and England, and that people from the US or UK can, for instance, watch shows from India or any other country, but the problem is that English is spoken in a lot of places and it is not that difficult to understand the story of the film, while language barrier makes it hard to watch local movies from other countries. Translating them into English or at least providing English subtitles can significantly help, but it once again comes to money. The budget of local movies is really small and they can't afford to spend more on the translation of the movie. Governments could have offered free traslation of the movies to best local film industries, so the movies they make could become famous in other parts of the world.

To sum up, I believe that there are two main reasons for British and American movies being so popular all over the world. A lot of people can speak English, but not many can understand languages from other world regions, which makes it is easier for movies from the US or UK to spread. Also local industries don't have a lot of money to advertise their movies. Government can help solve both of these problems.",70,2,3

The sharpest dive can be seen in South Asia where the total numbers felt sharply from about 33 million to approximately 10 millions children. The chart also indicates that the number of girls who do not have access to primary school is higher than that of the boys. However, the situation became the opposite in South Asia and in the Rest of the world by 2012, where the number of male students without primary education is slightly higher (5,1 million compared to 4,8 million female students in South Asia and 7,7 versus 7,6 million in the rest of the world).

Throughout the history, men and women were always distinct  male jobs from female jobs , an the reason was nor the stereotypes , but biological features. At a whole, men are more physically developed , and more capable of doing a repeatable machanical work is much easier for them, such a clothing is . To specialize on a type of work you're best at, is the most efficient way to organise society.
Social aspect also helps with specialization , for example, barbers are more frequently women than men, because fashion is their sphere of interest.
However, there always are deviations , and we must wespect them, if a woman wants to become a mathematician, and has skills in math, we should never limit her ambitions. Some with a mon who wants to become specialist in fashion.
If universities ever would count gender as a decisive factor, the whole education system would be broken in my opinion. Why would a girl student care about the exams while she can go into the elite tech colleges , and be accepted only because she is a girl , and a gender equality heeds to be strained.
All organizations , from my point of view , should never care whether studen or employee or a candidate is a male or a female . Only thing that really matters is their personal skills and dedication. Maybe this way we will miss a gender equality, but we will achieve a much more important thing , the people equality.

I, personally, think that copying and sharing music or films on the internet is kind of theft. Firstly, all people need to protect law and be under it, the modern rules of author’s rights try to stop it (copying and sharing), that is why people who copy films and music are thefts. Secondly, musicians and film producers spent a lot of money and time to make their films and audios, and when they do not have money from using it by other people it is dishonesty. Thirdly, people who copy and share films and old music made it only for money, it looks like theft from you house in order to sell it on the black market.
But, there is opposite opinion, that copying and sharing are not theft. To begin with, people who copy and share films and audios are like Robin Hoods of modern world, because usually producers and musicians are rich, and they do not lose a lot while their audios and movies sent to internet, but poor people could use it. Moreover, the internet is a free “opposite” world where not all laws are acting, there is a free information about everything in the world there and music and films are also should be free.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that despite two opposite oppinions the position of people who say that copying and sharing is the theft is more clear because in order to live in free society, with opportunity to have affair wages you need to be under the law, and law said, that it is kind of foul.

According to their research all people have their own understandings of happiness, which were influenced by their education, the perception of the world and cultural background. What is more, the relationships between the members of the family where the person was grown up, play a great role in the determing of this subject.

First, I would like to outline that we can not be happy without close people who can support us in the difficult period of our life and help us to overcome troubles. They can be our friends, family, parents, but, without any doubts, it is necessary to have such people by our side.
Second, to achieve finacial aspect should not be the main goal of our life, nevertheless, without certain level of prosperity we can not afford to have the life which is illustrated in mass media because of the development of the consumer society. Feeling of unsuccess can influence on our minds and disturb us from the enjoing of our life. I want to add that travellings that give us new impressions and good education can not happen without money.
What matters most in this case that the person feel comfortable and appcacemental only in a good political and economic situation in the world.

Several health problems are caused by widespread of modern technology. First of all, it could be some kinds of addictions. For example, computer addiction. Information in the Internet is such interesting and attractive that people cannot log out and return to the real life. Secondly, spending a lot of time in front of computer is followed by problems with eyes. People have to wear glasses to see everything well. Sitting in front of computer may also cause overweight, if you are not moving anywhere. Finally, the content of several web pages could cause psychological problems or ever force people to commit a suicide. 

In my opinion, the number of steps can be made to reduce the negative impact on people’s health. To start with, free call centers should be created to help computer adductors. The next step could be improving technology to make them less harmful to health. Finally, should take care about the other kinds of facilities, that could attract people more than computers and mobile phones in their spare time. For example, creation of new cinemas or theatres can be done.

However, I cannot agree with the idea that air travels mostly affect our Earth.
Firstly, the modern technology is becoming more and more developped that can let people to constuct insecure airplanes. Secondly, people travel by airplanes because it gives them the possibility to do a lot of useful things in time. So, if the amount of air travels reduced, most businessmen can lose the chance to evolve their affairs and to become succesful. Moreover, sometimes people can let themselves to go to other countries for some leisure activities once per year. So, if this way of travelling can be forbiden by the government people will lose that single possibilty to relax near the sea or the ocean as well. Nevertheles, some opponents say that it is the most significant problem. I partly agree that a lot of air travel is unnecessary because trains are modernized now and it can offer us more comfortable ways to reach our destionation. Besides, we usually spend a lot of time on short-term air travels instead of using cars or trains.
However, there is no doubt that governments should pay more attention to other problems that also cause various pollutions. For example, they could introduce laws that would reduce smoking more than two times per day. Furthermore, they should think about the use of cars, the contribution of lights and water at home. To sum up, I would like to say that governments have to solve the problem with air pollution and global warming. However, they should take into consideration all the aspects of that issue.",65,2,1

However, other people think that such social networks can easily be a great source of information. In this essay I will try to express my own opinion and support it with arguments and examples. First of all, it is common knowledge that social networks are the greate source of information which people can easily use. For example, Facebook or Vkontakte has a great number of users from different countries, of different beliefs. So, you can ask them questions, get interesting information from them or even argue with them. It means that you can get experience and knowledge just from people. Secondly, such social media as Vkontakte has a lot of publications which people can easily download from it, usually it is free. Moreover, you can post your publication and share your information or knowledge. The great examples is Twitter where people just share their views and discuss variants problems. Although there is another point of view. Other people say that the main pupose of social networks is just to entertain users. They argue that such social medias are filled by entertaining content which can not give you any useful information. They also say that most of the information is not true. So you should not trust it and use in your course work, for example. To sum up, I suppose that social media is a hard topic to discuss. But it is hard to underestimate it’s role in our live. And I think it can be both the source of information for people and the source with a great amount of entertaining content fro users. So, it depends or preferences of a particular user.

As it can be seen from the charts, there was more Italians at the age of 15-59 than Yemen's in the 2000. However, 0-14 Yemen's year-olds trebled the Italy one's and reached just over 50%. The percentage of people from Italy aged 60 or more was 24,1%, when the same group in Yemen was only 3.6%.
The projections for both cathegories follow by different patterns. It is predicted, that Yemen population will consist of a bit more than one half of 15-59 year-olds. 1/3 of 0-14 year-olds and only 5.7% will be occupied by people aged 60 or more years old by the 2050. The Italian population will be resulted in the next figures: 46.2% of people aged between 15-59 years old, 42.3% of the eldest group, 11.5% of 0-14 year-olds.
By observing the charts, it can be concluded that there is a marked tendency to become 'old' population for Italy, when Yemen will save the balance between 0-14 year-olds and 15-59 year-olds, while people, who aged 60 or more, will remain stable enough at a low.

On the one side, there is an opinion that people need to have a large amount of sport centres and other ways to do sport. On the other side there are some believers that some other ways of improving health can be useful. Undoubtedly, they are both have pros, however examples and data can find some cons. This essay will consider it and after I will state my own opinion.


The first plus of having more ways to do sport is that it is widely known about its positive impact on people's health. Sportsmen have better cardiowork, their bones are stronger and mussels support all the body structure. However there is hidden bad side of it. Most of people do not do sport proparly, they tend to use supplements, which can improve their results faster, even if it would have bad impact on health. It is the minus of big amount of sport facilities, which are not necessary for people, but rising risk of buying drugs with unknown effects.


On the other hand, what positive side other measures of increasing number of health people have? First of all, there is popularization of healthy life-style be advertising, TV - programmes and books. People deside to have a life-style like popular persons and stars have. For example, nowadays magazines and Internet demonstrate us that a lot of singers and actors are vegans. It is widely common tend and people tend to believe it and act as they are. However not all popular persons can be a good example of healthy way living. Teenagers follow stars in their social media (like Twitter and Instagram) and can find some dark side of wealth, which are not healthy.


All things considered, it should be noted that there is no clear answer to what way of improving national health government or every person should choose. In my opinion, there should be steps, including all way of reaching destination, which unite will bring the right results, no matter which exactly way will be chosen.

Although, some people treat that fact neutrally or even support the idea of free aquiring of the files they want, there is a law in almost all the counties worldwide that is supposed to punish such initiatives and, to my mind, it is the only way to preserve some artist’s exclusive rights and help the industies to keep developing.
To start with, illegal copying of somebody’s piece of art is undoubtedly equal to the ordinary theft at least because the music people record and the movies they film are their sources of getting money, while the developed pirate activity nowadays make the producers and musicians loose a huge part of the profit they deserve. Therefore, it is simply not fair to litteraly make such people be unpaid for the work they have already done.
Moreover, the pirate activity impacts harmfully on the development of such spheres as film-making industry and music, since it weakens the incentives of artists, to some extent, to make better products in the future, since the files downloaded by fans fofree while they are supposed to be purchased for money is the feedback from the audience that goes with no respect.
To conclude, all the people who are eager to listen to music or watch movies have to reset their mindset considering the perception of both of those things as the same work as, for example, doctor or economist, which means it should not be paid and not partially. Fortunately, there such platforms as, for instance, Apple Music which make the legal audio files availiable just for the small fixed fee per month let alone such additional advantages as personal playlists and the new music advised according to the one’s interests.

It is popular belief that person who download pirate files should be punished because he must buy the original document. In my opinion, people downloading illegal files should not carry a punishment, but it is necessary to level accusations for person who share these illegal copies in the web space.

To start with, today people use the Internet to gain an access to some films, musical albooms and other documents. Some of them are pirate and illegal. Formally, person downloading these files is a theft. But I believe that we could not identify this actions as illegal because person just save documents that are free and available on the Web. Consequently, person can not recognize the type of these copies and download them. In addtion, we could not define the set of crime because people are involved in complex web relationship.

I argue that responsibility in this situation should be laid on shoulders of people who distribute this content in the Internet. Firstly, it is really illegal action to share the films and musical files that have a copyright. Secondly, there we can define the set of crime because source and person may be revealed by web specialists.

Finally, downloading of illegal copies should also be prevented. The pivotal mean is to carry out a profound oversight for web pirates. But I should repeat there is no basis to punish person who just find and download copies, instead of buying the official version.

To sum up, saving of pirate copies can not be defined as a crime, because person just use the Internet as a source of files and documents. But people who share these illegal versions should be punished because it is really criminal action.

We wouldn’t be untrue if we would say that almost all modern culture is based on the idea that it should make people happy.
But the main thing is that nobody exactly knows what does it mean “to be happy”. There is strategies for answering this question . We can say that happiness is very personal feeling which cannot be put in words. Sometimes there are all circumstances for a person for being happy, but he feels nothing. But At the same time there could be a man, who had almost nothing: no work, no money, no health, no family, but he would think that he’s the happiest in the world. Statistics can give us some surprises . It tells us that the most happy countries are not in Europe or in America, but in poor african countries like Nigeria. Happiness is the concept which just goes out of an rationality so that’s why we cannot put  the feeling of being happy in words.
And we face more difficulties when we try not even to define happiness but to show “ingridients” of that feeling. We’ve already shown that happiness is more than just wealth or health because otherwise some Europe countries would lead, not poor and ill african failed stales. So all we can suggest is that happiness is linked with some state of soul, some piece between man and himself. Modern world destroys that piece, put a person into constant conflicts, for example we have to make money by making thinks he doesn’t like or something in that way. And he tries to find the lost piece of himself in the modern industries built to make people happy. He goes into traveling or clubs or aquaparks or expend sports but that is the wrong way.
The happiness is the state of mind which cannot be brought to a man by anything except man himself. So it seems to be impossible to find any common factors or find a recept, suitable for every situation.

Some people argue that Facebook, Vkontakte, etc. should contribute to the further sharing of information and knowledge. The others see the main function of such networks in entertainment. In this essay I will consider both points of view. Turning to the first opinion, it should be mentioned if social media keep on developing in the direction of sharing knowledge, it will contribute to worldwide improvements in technologies and prosperity. Information is a factor of an utmost significance today, and knowing the latest developments in other countries is very important in all spheres of life. For instance, shifts in consumer preferencies may be observed from social networks, therefor leading some businesses to changes. Such an approach can be a little bit misleading as the information in such a medium can be misinterpreted as it is not always written in a literally way. Talking about the other point of view, entertainment has become an essential part of our everyday life. I mean, that with a lot of stress all around us there should be left some room for leisure. And in that way social networks help to get rid of the unbearable part of the reality. However, such trate of thinking can lead to more people being considered as social outcast as they do not participate in real life, indeed being absorbed in their devices constantly scrolling web-pages. It also can have a detrimental impact on any economy.  To conclude, two ways of thinking on the purpose of social media considered there are both prons and cons in each approach. Personally, I think that we should not put functions under question apart as both information and entertainment are important and can exist at one and the same time.

Musicians and film makers are losing a lot of money from this type of coping and sharing without official buying the original discs. So the idea is that people who downloading illegal copies from the internet should be punished.
Every human on our wold has their own property right if wants so. And when somobody creates anything he has the right to sell it to other people. From these point of view, making illegal copies is a really bad thing, because after this musicians and film producers might not be able to create anything again in case they are run out of money. Some people said that there would be much more art, films and music if everyone honest support creaters and buy legal cop. That’s why people who download illegally should be punished.
On the other hand, the direct effect of punishing people to prevent buying illegal copies would be opposite from “more good art, films and music”. It is clear that not every film and music in our world is a great piece of art, because sometimes the only purpose for producers and musician is to make more money. So, when nobody knows is that film good or bad and they need to buy it or they would be punished doesn’t provide good cuality produc. The idea of this point of view is that people should only support creators if they like produc. They can go to the cinema to watch the film they liked or buy legal copy of music disk. In this way only good produc would get a lot of money and make our world better.
To sum up, this is very complicated problem. Better solution would be the right to people to deside by themselves do the want make their produc with property licence. In this case people would get time to pay for produc and after some time try it free in the internet, because internet is not belong to anyone.

Advantages and minuses of this trend will be described below.

To begin with, the main plus of well-known companies is stability.
People often tend to safety, so they need to know the ingredients of food they eat, the label of goods they consume, etc. Therefore, multinational brands always have a popularity with customers, because they offer the same level of goods` quality all over the world. That is why men trust large companies.

Moreover, it should be said that it is easier to create advertisments fot the chain of stores, because it will be recognisable and bright. If you have a monopoly on market, it will be much more beneficial for you to succed and earn money.

On the other hand, there is a huge drawback in process of replacing small companies by large ones. Not everyone is born is rich family and has a heritage of thriving business. If ordinal person would like to start out a carier due to his own deal, he needs space for development. However, he cannot succed, until some huge popular chains exist. People are not able to struggle with each other, if they have different backgrounds for businesses. Therefore, small companies need to tackle large ones.

All things considered, despite of the prominent disadvantage of this development, benefits are more important. People have reliable businesses, which supply customers with good service and owners with money and job.",65,2,2

First of all, I want to say that a gap year it’s a really good help for young people after school, because , usually, they don’t know what university they want to choose or what they particularly want to do , besides , it’s the best opportunity to get an experience , to meet new friends and to earn some money.
On the other hand this year can interrupt people’s education, because travelling and well-paid work very attractive for young people. It’s generally agreed that now many people have a dream to earn a lot of money without efforts. We have some examples , when the young people reached a success without university education and even without high school education, but it’s only a story , a fairytale. We should pay for all in our life.   
In my opinion, a gap year it’s very good thing only if your parents have possibilities on it. So many young people can not afford themselves , university education and they need to find the job. When I was finishing my school , I did not know what way I want to choose and I was very afraid .

Firstly, it is widely believed that some prisoners can run away from the law and the prison as well and they believe that prolonging sentences for them can prevent others to make crime.

I personally incline more to the opinion that there is more advantages than disadvantages. There are several  reasons for that. First of all, developing countries have a big amount of people, who are ready to work for a very small sallery. There is a lot of reasons why. Obviously, local workers really often have got big families, which are suffering from the lack of the meal, medicine, money. At this point, local workers ready to spend all day long doing the job that international companies will offer. Secondly, people who were born in developed countries since their childhood were trained to do hard work, so they don’t have to rest often. They won’t regret that they entered this job. According to the reserch from the University of Manchester, in India every second man is ready to work on international companies. However, there is also disadvantages such as the qualification of workers. Very often they don’t have every school education. So it is rather strange to ask them to do the work they won’t complete. But it is all nothing, because the work force is really enormous. To sum up, advantages of this development, obviously, outweight the disadvantages. It is easier for international companies to find workers in developing countries, because they need money to help their families. Secondly, they are very strong and ready yo work on the companies terms.

The study shows mere fall in printing books n the four-year period in every country and same growth in using electronic ones.
The most stable situation appears to be in Germany where interest in printed books is predicted to be the same and ebook market is expected to increase by one third. In other three countries the print market is going to decrease as the eBooks gain more investment. According to the chart the printed books in China will not hit a mark lower than 4,2 billion US Dollars while the rate of eBooks is going to double. As for the UK, the book market is not expected to change gradually, though the printed books will probably be left behind by 0,3 billion US Dollars.

It can be caused by different things, such as people around a person, teachers, which can probably teach students something inappropriate or parents which don't spend enough time with their child. Solution for the problem have to touch one of groups of people described above.
Firstly, parents have to control their child's interests and people around him. Children usually don't know which society they meet in the streets to join. Because of their wrong choices, sometimes they are being pushed for illegal activities and sometimes they get wrong understanding of the world. In the era of the Internet, children's intrests can go by a dangerous way, because the Internet is full of violence and inappropriate materials which anyone can get access to.
Secondly, teachers should learn students how to make a right choice. How to choose friends, how to get respect in society, how to behave to become independent and successfull.
Also, in the modern world, there should be teached a cyber safety subject in schools. It is important to protect children from the Internet's influence. Teachers should also make the marks of students available for their parents to make their mother and father understanding if everything is fine with their child.
To decrease the amount of crimes made by younger people, parents should watch their developing and control it, spend more time to make their child more adapted to modern society. As for teachers, they should learn their students to pick a right side in society and how to use the Internet right. Using this solutions, we can decrease the children crime rate.

More and more people claim that teenagers have become more cruel than ever before.The statistics showes that more than 46% of youngsters were prosecuted and punished for commited crimes. It is vitaly important to decrease the number of crimes and then eradicate it at all. In this essay I will outline the causes of increased crime rates among teenagers and offer several solutions to eradicate the problem.

There are several reasions which influence the developing of crime among teens. The first reason is that the gun law was eased recently, so now it is much easier to buy the gun in the shop. Moreover, violent computer games have become widely spread and these games have a bad impact on youngsters' mental health. For young people,having committed a crime on computer many times,is more difficult to distinguish reality from fiction and if a teenager was offended, he or she can hurt someone just because they used to do it online.

Although the situation is complicated many things can be done to solve the problem. At first, special classes at schools, where students will be taught of alternative ways of solution a problem instead of usage of gun. MOre job offers can be given to youngsters at shcool, so they will be more busy and financially independent and will not steal the things they need. One more option is special restrictions in law, abolishing the usage of gun or knife in public places such as schools and shopping malls.
To conclude, it is vitaly important to solve the problem and many more issues can be taken. Having paid more attention to it the crime rates will be decreased significantly.",70,2,0

One of the possible measures is rising of quantity of sports facilities. However, this solution may be not so productive.


In the beginning, people will healthier if they are keen on sports, that is why opportunities to be involved in these kinds of activity are necessary for everybody. Moreover, diversity of sport sections attracts a lot of people and it can have positive influence on lifestyle of the majority of citizens. Changes of the way of living are impossible without avarage persons, who will not try doing sports only by themselves.


However, there is another point of view. Modern people can find every possibilities in order to be healthier. Demand on sport activities are satisfied and people nowadays have enough sport facilities.  Furthermore, humans can support their health without additional facilities, because physical activity are possible in any way for interested people.


In conclusion, I must admit that people should have appropriate number of sports facilities, but just increasing of them is not solving the problem absolutely due to human motivation. Moreover, such factors as pollution and a lack of physical activity have already become the tendency of our time.

But the most interesting thing is that many of air travel is unnecessary, that’s why a lot of people think that governments should reduce the quantity of air travel by laws. I completely agree with the statement, and my essay will be about benefits of this solution to the problem.
First and foremost, there are a lot of other different way of travel: by bus, by train, by car. Everyone chooses his/her favourite one. Moreover, these kinds of transport has not been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Despite the fact that they are slower than plains, I think that nobody wants to breathe by dirty air contributing by air transport.
The second advantage of introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel is that, in my opinion, people will be able to enjoy picturesque landscapes and take much more photoes travelling by train or by car. They will be able to spend more time with their famalies, comunicating with the relatives during the trip. It will also be easy for travellers to broaden their horizons with the help of comunication with people from other towns, cities and even countries.
The third benefit of this solution, to my mind, is that people will be able to spend less on tickets to go to another place. It is not a secret that tickets on air travel are more expensive than, for example, tickets on train.
In the conclusion I would like to say that if governments take the law, it will be a reason of many advantages not only for environment, but also for people.

On the one hand, modern technology bring not only the use but health problems too. Some of them connected with computers, mobile and TV screens, simply saying, with gadgets which we use every day. People suffer with eye sick because of harmful screen shine. Nowadays more and more people need glasses and the cause is not a biological factors. Also, the Internet makes our brains less functional. Problems with memory and attention are developing because of link system and the huge volume of information. Such problems can lead to mental desieses. Technologies in food industry can also be harmful for people. Fast food is calorie meal which leads to problem with stomach and also with weights.

On the other hand, modern technologies are friends of human beings. We have enormous amount of possibilities thankful to them.

The last but not the least the possibilities of medicine. Today there is almost no desieses which are not treated. So, I think that the solution of health problems in our hands.

I strongly believe that it is not important. I think that students should study subjects , which they interested in. And studing should not depends on who you are male or female.
First of all, in our time, when students chouse university, they think about what they will study for next years. Students want study only that they interested in. Moreover, there are a lot of universities which give for their students perfomance of chousing subjects. And when all students have an individual plans of study, it starts very difficult to see for numbers of male and female students in every subject.
On the other hand, there are some views of people who strongly believe that universities should control numbers of male and female students. This people think that this reason can have affect on students. For example, in one subject, which must study all students, there are more female students. And male student will have bad results in the end of this subject. However, can be that female students will have non good results in the end of the course. Nevertheless, there are some others opinions which believe that the study process can not depend on numbers of male and female students and depends only on wants and interests of student. 
In conclusion, I want to say that numbers of male and female students should not be control by universities. I strongly believe that this factor can not be important for students and for universities.

On the one side,it is a good, right and actual decision. In our time where a lot of people, who start visit fitness clubs and centres. This process become more popular and fashion at the time. It means that not only the middle age people start doing sport, but also the young man and girls do the same. It can help to have a perfect fisical forms and shapes, but does it really works? On the other side, where is mush more effective way to make yourself more healthy: it is a healthy food. In comparison with fitness club it is much more cheap. Everyone can buy it in every shop. In my opinion, I think that healthy food is more convenient way to solve the problem in comparison with fitness club. For example, a poor student studys in big city in the university, he has no money to visit fitness centre, but he has enough money to buy healthy food. In addition, he can combine these two aspects at home for free. To sum up all opinions, we can find the best solution. The best way to make yourself more healthy is combination of sport and healthy food.

In my opinion, there are a few causes of such problem.
Firstly, I think that the society became more depraved nowadays, comparing with the past. It became cool to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, use drugs – it is connected with a stereotype of wild and funny life, which is shown to young people in the Internet and TV shows. Young people aren’t smart and wise enough to differentiate what is good and what is bad. They want to decide by themselves what life to live – that’s why they don’t listen to their parents and relatives, even if their advices are good and right. Secondly, nowadays there is an enormous pressure in lives of young men. They are asked to be good at school by their parents, then they try to enter the university, even if they have to take huge student loans. After the university there will be a job with mammoth working hours. Then, kids, family… Only after a retirement they might be happy! It is a long hard way. If a young man makes a mistake at one of these steps he may think that he lost everything and that he would never be successful. So, if there aren’t incentives to be good, why can’t he become bad?
I think that in order to decrease the level of crimes commited by young men the whole teaching system should be changed. Schools and universities should shift from pressure and everlasting competition among students to giving them opportunities to explore the world and find themselves. Also, the society should change ideals that are dictated by the media – from money, superficial beauty, luxury life to love, kindness, truly happy life.

We can not imagen our lifes without listening to music while walking to the bus stop or watching film with friends on Saturday evening. But if we will pay all time when we are doing this normal things the cultural life becomes just for rich part of the world.

At first, all of us knows that movies and music creators make money on the advertisment. For example in every film we can see some brend of clothes, marks of cars, or food like Twix, Orep e.t.c. If we will think on that side, then somebody still and share the film on the internet it is not a problem, because all people can see and the creator does not lose lots of money. Because the money is from the advertisment. 

Secondly, most music fans, if they like the group will buy the T-shorts or something like that with photos of favourite groups. That also helps making and saving money.

At the conclusion I want to explicate that sharing something on the Internet does the matirial more popular and then it becomes importat for other people. From all that I have been written we can understand that illegal copies just help film and music makers become popular and famous. That gives them more money and profit.

So, it can be caused by several reasons. And we should try to find a solution of this problem. 
On the one hand, one of the causes of such students` behaviour is considered to be their age period. So, the time in school is very difficult for pupils, because it is the period of the foundation of their personality. That`s why, teenagers often do some impulsive things or smth like these. What is more, sometimes if teenagers do not know what to do in certan situation, they are able to make bad things. However, it doesn`t means that they wanted to do or say smth like they did. 
Of course there are a lot of other causes why pupils have problems with their behaviour. Nevertheless, when teachers communicate with such teenagers they should always remember about the specify of the teenager`s behaviour. Moreover, older people are able to try to be more kind with students. However, they should always make a lealance between kind behaviour and strickt behaviour. In addition, it seems to be a good idea to organise some collectives in shooles where teenagers can go and communicate with each other, where they are able to do smt together or to tell smb about their problems. Thank`s to such collective students can avoid stees, conseguantely, the will be more kind.

This essay agrees with the statement that there are several health problems caused by the widespread of Internet. Firstly, it will describe some of those problems and then it will discuss some possible solutions. 

To begin, the use of technologies means long lasting period of time spending in front of computer or TV-screen. This could negatively affect human’s health by detesoiting vision. In 2011 it was reported in The Times that 73% of adolescents mention that because of computer usage their vision gets considerably worse. Moreover, hours spent in one position may be followed by pains in back or even by misdevelopment of spine. It can be also mentioned that some of teenagers and adults suffer from virtual addiction and other mental disorders. This can be illustrated by the fact that there was an increase in the number of crimes committed by videogames in the recent years. 

There are certain ways that may reduce this problems. Fir instance, there might be special screens constructed, which will meet all medical requirements and will be less harmful for human’s vision. What else can be made to support the health of computer users is a design of office chairs reducing the pressure put on the back. To avoid detrimental influence on teenager’s phychic there could be spesical educational coursers organized in order to explain children what the virtual reality is. 

To conclude, this essay supports the idea of a number of health problems caused by overuse of new technologies. Nevertheless, people could neglect some of negative consequences due to conscious usage of Internet.

There are more urgent problems that cannot be ignored such as poverty and environmental issues. I do not agree with this opinion.
First if all, our planet runs out of fossils and resources such as oil or water. We will need some other source of them very soon. Trees are cut everywhere for making goods for people so this process cannot be stopped. However, we know that trees are the source of oxygeon -- the thing we cannot breath without. That means we eventually make ourselves lose the most important thing in life. Therefore we need to explore the space: we look for a place where we can leave some day, but for now no human being do not even reach the Marce. People should spend much time and money on developing technologies to make it happen. Otherwise, some day we will have no place to go.
Secondly, problems with environment are too large to be solved. No one can force every man on the Earth use sun-charged cars instead of oil, for example. There are also a lot of trash everywhere and we even have no place to put it.
Furthemore, goverments and societies over the world do a lot of work for poor people: social programs that include giving money or jobs, free food in churches and special places for homeless people to sleep.
The main point is that it does not mean there are enough money for these problems. However, space exploring is too important sphere to be taken money from and people can work out other ways to solve them: to decrease sallaries of politicians, for example.
In conclusion I would like to say, poverty and environmental issues are important and large problems too, but they are not the only problems that should be solved. Space exploring will help us to survive so goverments should pay attention to it too.",65,2,2

Also we shouldnot forget about medicine – while the woman are pregnant, she spents much money for that. The older kid is, the more money he or she needs. When child is grown up, he or she need the education, and on the West almost every education must be paid. The situation becomes more serious, if you have more than one baby.

Of course, there are some advantages and disadvantages for this action. 
Of course, it is a very good time for travelling, because at this age from 17 to 29 years old, young people at this age have no problem with free time, they do not think about it. They have no children, who need a lot of attention and much of time. This year could be exelent, because they can meet a lot of new interesting and nice people. They can visit a lot of countries and may be fall in love with somebody from another place. 
Unfortunately, despite that there some consequances. It could be just wasting of time. This year can be essential because if young people after finishing high school want to be encouraged to work or travel for a year befor university studies, it could be complicated to enteir at the university later. That can happen because they can forget some featurs that can be useful and important at the university and it could be hard to get it again.

Nevertheless, these products are often treated as ones that should be available for anyone. So, is it fair to call pirate copying a theft and, consequently, should people, who make film or music copies and spread them, be punished?
Once John Lennon said that music should be for each and every one. I strongly agree with him and add that any kind of art should be available for masses and I have a couple of thoughts to support my point of view.
First of all, I tend to think that rising the intelligence level of masses or remaining it on the high level is of great importance. If we block ourselves from almost the whole art sphere, we will probably return to the Medievals when human thought and art was in deep crisis. The new Dark ages in XXI century is nonsense so calling the interest in music or film products a crime is not the right thing to do.
Secondly, I consider that musicians and producers have much more ways to earn money than just by selling films and records. For instance, musicians go on tour and give concerts and filmmakers have an income while their works are shown in cinematheatres.
Taking everything mentioned above into consideration, I believe that by blocking free access to art works people of these industries block themselves from all the money they could earn. Because who would pay money for the unknown and who would go to a music performance if very few people know whose the performance is?

As for as I'm concerned, the majority determinates it as happiness and its achievement or, moreover, maintenance during all the life. However, a few people can define this motion and explain clearly what it is because of enormous amount of feelings, emotions and associations related with happiness. Besides that, reasons of feeling happy can be different for everyone.
	Actually, young people are less conscious than adult and, consequently, are not able to define what usually brings them happiness. After 25 years old every person becomes determining itself, accostumbrating to some habbits and preferences, etc. Adult people often clearly know what the need to improve their mood, to feel better and to experience unforgettable emotions. Everyone chooses for his own factor that brings him positive emotions and uses it. 
	It's quite clear that often the real factor is a great secret, hard to tell it to others, or it's difficultly achievable, Kare or somethnig else. In this case, to my mind, happiness can be achieved by healthy lifestyle, minimum of stress and dissappointments, positive people around and job that you like.
	On the other hand, it's hard to achieve happiness being lonely, without any support. Definetely, every person needs to be loved, cared and enough socialized. As a matter of fact, such feelings bring to endorphins and it means ""happiness"" in the physical level.
	Finally, I'd like to mention that i agree with the majority of people who say that achieving happiness is the main human objective. Despite of different senses of this motion in everyone's mind and complicated rout to the final aim, people need to be strong in their desire to experience all the possible factors and final the unique one, that brings them feeling of being happy.

Such people use others work (films, music, songs) and make money, spreading materials on the world wide web. Some people think that such activities must be ban, and users, who downloads illegal files, should be punished too. I partely agree with this opinion and I will try to explain my possition in the essay.

First of all, people, copying music and films, do it illegal, without agreement of authors. It is theft and fraud. Moreover, pirates not only copy, but also share and even seld fils. In many contries it is prohibit on the government level. Hence, pirates act against the low and people help them, buying or downloading copies, instead of paying to real authors.

However, actions of pirates have a positive effect too. Firstly, the make an advertisment for films, which they are copying. For example, human downloaded film from the internet, watched it and decided to go to the cinema for watching film in the full-screen.

Secondly, due to pirates there are a lot of films on the Internet and films by unfamous producers too. Human may know about talanted artists or directors, whose films you cannot see on TV.

Moreover, because of sharing music or films on the Internet, they become widespread and people who have not the opportunity to buy expensive DVD may watch his or her favourite film on the Internet.

To sum up, activity of pirates is illegal and cause damage to authors. However, there are some benefits for people who like watching films or listening music - they may do it free.

Unfortunately, we can be faced with cheating every day, as it is a common occassion. Sport is not an exception. Cheating in sport takes form of using illegal drugs by sportsmen to increase their physical powers. This essay will discuss two points of view, whether athletes on forbidden drugs should be excluded from competition forever or for a certain period.
Some people believe that sport is not a field for deception. Achieving high results demands a lot of hardwork, concentration and pain. If a sportsman was caught on using chemicals, which are banned, he could not be considered as a real athlete. He loses all respect of sport community. Adherents of this point of view consider that if there was cheating, it can take place the other time.
On the other hand, there is another opinion that everybody can get a chance. Some of us are convinced that nobody is perfect, and even famous athletes can make a wrong choice. They remind us that there is an enormous pressure on competitions. Every athlete is determined to win. They are suppressed by the couches, family and even government. Therefore, illegal drugs are the way to calm the nerves and be sure of victory. Following this way of thought, people believe that it is too severe to end careers of sportsmen, who had been working hard all their lives to master their skills and who got caught of cheating the first time.
From my point of view, all athletes who got caught on using forbidden drugs should be banned only if it was their second time. Despite using drugs for the first time being a serious issue, it seems to me that one occasion should not bring athlete's career to the end.
To conclude, using drugs is considered as a grave form of cheating. However, sometimes it should not ruin one's previous labour and achievements.

However, metals were not much delivered by road and take only 11% of all deliveries, losing to food products, which were 30%. Nevertheless, the percentage of manufactured goods that were transported by train was almost the same in railway transportations, and they were 28% and 25%. Moreover, non-metallic transportations by road took around 13% of all deliveries which in railway system they were not much preferable.

Under any curcumstances, such strongly tends to be quite efficient and non-practical, which could be provided with the arguments below. To begin with, each policy in a sphere of worldwide business is utterly unfriendly to developing countries’ ecology. In 21st century  factor of pollution becomes extremely crutial, and every company, moving it’s factories abroad should not only be concerned about it, but also to be ready to cope with difficulties and results of such actions. By the date one of the most impressive examples is an ecological situation of China’s regions, which have become a landers of German, French and other countries factories’ and which already have caused numerous problems, threatening an ozon layes, seas clarity and soil state not only inside China’s boarders, but all over the world.

Numerous ethnical features have been destroyed by growth of industry, all over the world, many unique tribes have lost their living places, many languages will never sound on or planet anymore due to human greed and vigor to have more money. An example of that is a story of Pocahontas, which have been taking place in North America in 17th century, while these lands were conquered by Europeans, and this have become a huge threat to local Indians. All in all, today economical reasons are dictating their own rules in policy, but the harm of its consequences should make us think about whether it is important enough or not and we should decide: will we still want to be rich if there would be no place to live and no one to share this perk.

What is more, mostly young people commit them, though this situation didn't have place in the past. So, what are the causes of this situation and what can people do to solve such a problem?

In my opinion, all the problems begin in the childhood. Nowadays children watch TV a lot. And there is not a strong censorship, so large amount of films contain the scenes of violence. The same situation is with computer games. Children spend most of their time in front of the computers playing computer games, in many cases because they do not have another ways to entertain themselves. And practically every game is about war, fights or just also containes a lot of violent scenes. All these things can influence a child, make him repeat the actions he notices.
Well, the first solution to this problem is to improve the censorship, so to only good and useful films and computer games be available for children.It can help to make them see good actions and repeat them in their lives or to improve their logic. However, modern children and teenagers can easily break the rules and find some ways to get rid of them.

What is more, it it significant to do many activities which children from their birth, do not leave their alone on their own. Then they will not be able to waste time in front of the computers and TV. This solution will also be helpful in attempts to make a child be interested in different spheres of life. But, of course, sometimes parents cannot find enough time for their children.
And also, an essential solution to this problem is to help a child to find his hobby. It will let him be surrounded with his favourite things, avoid bad influence, not waste their time for some unnecessary things.
To sum up, I strongly believe that the number of crimes committed by young people can be reduced, their parents just have to pay attention to their children since they are born.",65,2,0

It is commonly asserted that the way modern technologies are used, can cause human health problems. This essay eliminates such problems. Some solutions that can prevent health diseases will be given. 

To begin with, the great threat for human existing is nuclear power stations. They are built to get nuclear power which be transformed to electricity. It is assumed that such power is cheaper than other sources of energy. Nevertheless, the fire and nuclear explosion in the USSR in the 1980s revealed the fact that radiation is harmful for both human health and nature. Secondly, there are many technologies to grow plants, crops and animals which will go on market. Some of the technologies are supposed to use GMO material. But the influence on human consuming such produce and animal meat is not studied yet. Some scientists believe that GMO technologies have to be abandoned. What more, the threat for human health are factories which are situated in the big cities. Fumes they evaporate reduce the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere and influence on people’s lungs and heart. 

To solve the problems above there can be some solutions. First of all, scientists, together with a government, have to find an alternative sources of energy. Otherwise, human-kind can see another tragedy in the future. Also, to solve the problem of hunger farmes have to be subssidesed and the landfarms have to be increased in order to use chemical which can  cause serious problems for future generations. Moreover, factories can be moved out of the cities in the places with low level of population. Also, some fines have to be introduced for extra pollution. Such measures will improve the health of the citizens. 

All in all, some health problems were eliminated. They are caused by the modern technologies which are used nowadays. Solutions given in this essay will help to reduce problems.

Some people believe that consequence of using drugs by sportsmen should be denying participance of that athlet for limited period. While another part of people claim that punishment should be stricker - banning for the rest of their lives. This essay will demonstrate two different points of view.
Athletes should be given a punishment - 2 years without any competitons. People, that support that point of view, highlight situations when sportsmen didn't know that he used illegal drugs: for example, because of new rules or his doctor was not aware of essential information and gave illegal medicines. Another reason is that everyone, including sportsmen, has a chance for mistake and if sporstmes was punished, banned for some period of time, he would not try to do it again.
Although the majority claims that the althetes should be banned for 2 years, there is a group of people with contrary point of view. Sport is very fair part of live and using illegal drugs influence rules of sport. Moreover, that illegal medicines give more chances to win for participants from developed countries because they can provide their athletes contemporary drugs by modern techologies while developing countries cannot afford it because of lack of money and qualificated scholars. Furthermore, they believe that if sportman uses illegal drugs he broke rules of world sports community and could not be its member again.
Hence, I believe that if the athlet use drugs first time, he should be banned for 2 years but if more than once, he should be punished by banning for the rest of their lives. To sum up, that topic is very discussive nowadays and opponents are arguing till today.

That is why people make significant portion of contribution to searching ways to cope with existed situation. It was proven that air transport pollutes the atmosphere more noticeably than other means of transport. So then a lot of people firmly believe that governments should limit air travelling by low restrictions. As for me I totally disagree with above-mentioned view point.
To begin with it is worth mentioning that air travelling has lots of benefits that cannot be substituted by other more or less environmnentalal friendly means of transports. First of all I would point out the time economy which is relevant to be emphasized as one of the proses of air transportation. Law restrictions aimed to limit this sphere  will definitely cause more negative consequences than positive ones. Firstly it will affect the export contribution into governments budjet because such transportation of production will not be possible anymore. It will be caused by limitations of business travelling because mainly consensus concerning exported or imported production can be reachd during formal meeting located in the owner's country. Thus social level of life will fall by the reason of the absence of enough resources.  Finally leisure is as much important as business because it remains level of life stable. People who have opportunity to have a rest in other country have ability to compare and afterwards they work more efficiently and increase the level of productivity. 
However there are some opposite opinions that should be taken into consideration as well. Some people are convinced that above-mentioned problems caused by air travelling limitations do not overweight the consequences of air pollution. Some of them think that we are able to challenge such inconveniences in honour of our future life. Moreover we should think about our future generations and we are responsible for their life conditions.
But as for me future generations can be saved by lots of other ways. I have already proved that in most cases air travelling cannot be substituted. That is why we ought to consider other methods of saving environment involving the contribution of every single person. We should doubtles start the mission of saving the word from ourselves and our own habits.
To put everything in a nutshell I would conclude that limiting air travelling is not the most profitable idea due to wide range of significant negative consequences. There is a great amount of other ways to save the environment we need to focus on.

But some people think that everyone should respect the author’s piece of art and to legally buy it as they buy food or clothes. Others claim that the Internet is the place where you can get all the media stuff you want without paying for it because everyone does exactly the same thing.
To my mind, it’s fair and morally justificated to pay for someone’s else work no matter what type of work you’re dealing with. Firstly, it takes a lot of time for musicians and film producers to create the peace of art. They do a lot of work, spend money on the making process and advertisment, try to understand their audience. Secondly, intellectual property is protected by the law and everyone who doesn’t follow the judiciary system’s rules should be punished. Thirdly, it’s really important to protect the unique feature of musical and film industries when only the ones who are ready to pay for access to an art should take this opportunity.
However, some people assume that everyone should get an access to films and music because it’s impossible to destroy the market of pirate copies and in this case all the limitations don’t make sense. I totally disagree with this point of view because there is an improvement of law system and the system of market’s control and the amount of pirate copies decreases.
All things considered, I totally believe that musicians and film producers should get the whole amount of money for their work and everyone who ignores the law of intellectual property should be punished.

Then comes a considerable decrease for people from 25 to 34 men of this age only 153,8 minutes, yet women also get more busy, so their time falls to 92,8.

There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of these positions best I strongly believe that it is best that companies could do for developing countries. To begin with, the problem of unemployment in developing countries, such as Africa, is one of the main question among them. They do not have a lot of abilities or ways to get a well-paid job, so the idea that international companies gives solution to this problem to developing countries is great chance for local people to show what they could do. On the other hand, this step from big international companies may cause unpredictable consequences. Most of the people, which are living in developing countries do not have a high –level degree so they could do not understand a lot of things, which are essential to a company’s reputation. To sum up, it’s a great step from famous international companies to employ workers from developing countries, it is a great chance from people to try what they could do despite to all these things, such as lack of experience and a university’s degree.

A huge amount of people every day travel with air for business and leasure. Therefore by cutting the amount f air travel people will not use their kind of transport, they will conflict with the head of the orgnisations, that introduce new rules. Secondly, science develop new type of fuel. Nowadays, there are only for cars, but maybe in the nearest future researchers will allows for airplaines too. In this case, government can introduce a law bying this fuel by transport companies and use it  everywhere in the world. A lot of environmental problems exist because of not only one factor air travelling but also another – cars, rubbish etc. government should summarize the whole activities, which causes this decreases and cope with some of them in way not to disturb a normal life of people but to contribute to air pollution and other great problems.

But purpose of using it? Some people believe that social websites are necessary to share some knowledge and spread information. However, others argue that it is another way of entertainment. In this essay I am going to discuss both points of view and give my own opinion. Primarely, I will present people’s arguments in favour of that social media is the way to share information. Firstly, using social websites is cheap and simple in the modern conditions when technologies rule the world. It provides the possibility of cross-cultural communication and, of course, leads to the increase of knowledge at the local and international levels. Secondly, as the information is unlimited and the race it spreads is quite social media allow people know what happens all over the world. For example, a half of century age people could hardly know the news from the neighbour town but nowadays we are aware of the event and affairs. Then, there are some opinions that social websites are introduced only for having a good time. It is said that their users not interested in getting new knowledge. It can be true because many people tend to spend online free time and try to distract from the information given then at work. Moreover, there is an argument that information in social media like Facebook and Vkontakte can be wrong and there is no need for people to collect it. According to the statistics, many facts really turn to be online false. In conclusion, I should say that both points of view have their right to exist. Social media is a helpful method of sharing knowledge and information but it can be not used in the right way. I believe that having an account on such website will help both to share information and have a good time.

People who listen to and watch these copies are also crimers. I don’t support this idea because people downloadin illegal files just use free information from the internet.
First of all, illegal pirates copying these files should be punished. I agree that sharing music or films in such way is crime. It can be compared with burglary. But people consumed these files just download it like any othe free information in the Internet. For example, I often listen to music in social networks and sometimes I even don’t know that it’s downloaded illegaly. So it’s quite difficult to identify illegal copy.
Secondly, I believe that it is more rational to punish illegal pirates. Moreover, I consider musicians and filmproducers should save and protect their files more accurately. I think strictly control in cinemas wouldn’t allow pirates to copy films. Musicians should keep songs in secrets from everyone before it release. Nobody mustn’t have access to it.
Thirdly, to prevent illegal copying creators can make original disks cheaper. So, people will have an incentive to buy original record and listen or watch it in good quality. For example, it is cheaper to buy the disk for 150 ₽ than to watch a bad copy of film.
Taking everything into account, it must be said illegal pirates are really theives but not ordinary people. Internet users just consume the information and files from the Internet sometimes even not knowing that it was copying illegaly.

Let’s analyze temperature dispersion in Yakutsk. There is stable grow from winter to summer and slow decrease from summer to winter. That’s normal situation, but we can see that temperature in Rio de Janeiro never fall under approximately 17°C. In fact, summer in Rio lasts all year and never end.

The lower point of temperature in Yakutsk can be found in January and December, it equals -40°C, the highest point is under 30°C. Average delta between maximum and minimum temperature in every months Rio.

In this case, the law introduced by government should decrease the number of unnecessary flights, such as business and leisure air travel. In my point of view, this law could be a good solution and make impact in environment protection.
First of all, nowadays  the majority of airports offer a lot of type of planes with extra comfort options which contain less passengers while the level of damaging effect stay the same. For example, a lot of businessmen have private planes, which are comparable with the size of usual plane, but they use them for travelling with small number of people, like collegues or family, as frequent as usual plane is used. Consequently, they make the same ratio of damage.
Secondly, the reducing of the amount of business and leisure air travel could make more popular eco-friendly types of travel, such as, trains or electrocars. Some people think that plane is the fastest way to arrive in the destination point. However today the net of trains organised very convinient and it allows to move faster by train or tube in comparison with plane.
In conclusion, personally, the law reducing the number of unnecessary air travels could have a great impact on in decrease of air pollution and global warming because it reduces demaging effects and attracts attention to more environmentally friendly type of travelling.

From my view the main advantage is that large corporations may provide more working placed for the employee. I mean that we have a countless number of different factories as well as fars were the employee is always in need.Thats to this we will be able to shorten the unemployment rate.
But on the contrary there is a stuck of cons on that isue. Firstly a lot of people who have their own firms or work for themselfs will face with unemployment.They will be running of money and their families will suffer from it.

As a result, the government wants to delay travels for business and leisure. As for me, I agree with a big importance of climat and air pollution but I think that this law will make more problems. I have three explanations why the law which reduces amount of business and leisure travels is a bad idea. To start with, the business travel is very important for a communication between companies from different countries. This communication provides countries by new financial assets which help for economy growth. If the government prohibit business travel, the stream of money can confront a lot of difficults and foreign companies will stop communicating. Then the country will threat a lot of losses which slowen the economic growth. The second point is a possible lack of entertainment for population. If they like relaxing at other countries, the government shouldn’t prohibit to do it. Because there are countries which specialized on leasure and it is their part of the world work distribution. The last but not least, if government doesn’t allow to travel to other countries, they should make own entertainment sphere which replaces foreign one. However, it is a big investment and a lot of time which are not available for some countries. The opposite side supposes that the air pollution is a very crucial problem and each country should fights against if because of global warming. It is dangerous because of a raising temperiature which kills some types of animals and plants. However, plants produce clear air for people in order to the global warming is a serious problem for future generations. As for the second point of view, I believe that there are a lot of other problems which causes global warming such as waste, car traffic and others. So that I suggest that the government should reduce impact of these factors which help people and environment. All in all, the law reducted amount of air travel is illogical and global warming is caused by a lot of factors which are easy for interacting.

To begin with,a lot of children are under of the control of their parents. They are completely sure,that adults want to destroy their life and they try to avoid this control and to show,that they are self-confident.

In this essay I will discuss this problem and give my own opinion on it.

As for me, I believe that we do not need to stop any flights. Firstly, modern technologies allow to build such planes which will not pollute the atmosphere so much and will not cause any negative effects like global warming.

Secondly, many flights are just necessary because of economical reasons. I suppose, none of modern air company would make their planes fly empty if it was economically wrong. However, there is another opinion. Some people think that if we stop unnecessary flight or reduce them: air travel for business and leisure, we will help the nature. It is their main argument.

Unfortunately, they do not think about problems which can occure if we do this. For example, if we reduce the amount of flights, we must be ready to develop other types of transport, because people do travelling and do much. This must be done to avoid transport collapse.
To conclude, I would like to say that there are some problems with air pollution and global warming, but we just need to develop our technologies to avoid it without making another problems in social mass.

On the one hand, the intellectual property should be secured like other kinds of private property the desire of getting money for their work is absolutely moral. But the objects of intellectual creativity has one feature, which differ it from material valuables. It is endless using. You can make enormous number copies of your worn And earn money permanently. I tend to believe that it isn’t justice. To my point of view it can be rational to establish indiciary term when copying or sharing object of intellectual property is illegal but after completing of this period copying must be legal.
I agree that the break of copyright is crime. But I tend to feel that punishment for users is very cruel idea. All people has little weaknesses and vices. We can compare this situation with situation in struggle against drugs. In many countries the government punish only drug dealers not drug users. I think this way is relevant in situation with intellectual property. We must punish people who copy and share films and music not consumers.

Nowadays a lot of people continue to appreciate these films much more in comparison to their locally produced ones. However, it remains unclear if there definitely are enough reasons to think that British and American films are exactly better that films from other countries.

Firstly, there are special film industries in the UK and in the USA, especially in the USA, which have much more money and opportunities than these industries in other countries. Consequently, the films that were produced there are of a better quality and have more elaborated visual effects.
Moreover, advertising plays a big role in British and American films being more widespread than locally produced ones. People from all over the world see eye-cathing posters in the streets, in the cinemas and in the Internet. However, locally produced films often do not have enough money to spend on advertising and due to this fact a lot of peole just do not know about them.

Having said this, I would like to add that in spite of the fact that locally produced films are not good in the financial side of making a film, they have enough people resources.

In conclusion, I believe that government should take action on supporting local film industries and promoting their films.",70,2,1

The huge problem for yound generation are their parents who had given them awful upbringing and had spend little of time with children. To Know how prevent crimes by teenagers,parents and teachers should prevent watching a lot TV and play in violente games.

First of all, no one can deny that, according to the recent figures, there is an increace in violent throw young generation, robber and even murder crimes. As many scientists have claimed that, the main reason for this is that, nowadays, youth are growing with lack of pay attention by their patents but also teachers. Moreover, children are not getting social and emotional knowlege at their schools.

Second of all, action movies with murder, robber and being popular amoung youth. It is clearly seen that, these sort of movies lead to an increase crime amoung teenagers as they try to cope what they have seen in the movies.
Futhermore, films have an important influence both by what they watch and hear.

Fird of all, nowadays, no one does amaze, when read on newspapers and watch on the television about is most societies rights of people with way of violence.

In conclusion, from my point of view, the best way to control as well as reduce the number of crime is replace severe punishments than panaleties are such as, financial and even being prison.
Moreover, lack of social and emotional knowlege is one of the main factor to uncrease crime amoung youth due to the government shoul more pay attention to both aducation and law sistem.",55,2,0

Eviernment problem is very important; but air travel too expencive, and laws to reduce the amount of air travel can kill this part of economic.
The main argue is unmecessary air travel and possibility alternative. Modern world has a lot of oppotunities for traveling such as sea travel, car travel; train travel and etc. Moreover, this alternatives have more positive ways as well-known time in transport. In airbus you see only sun and don’t see trees; buildings; sea; animals, if you going to America from Russia on train and sea transport, you can satisfight views around train. However; in airbus usually people sleep. Furthermore, air pollution very dangerous for future own children will live with lower level of health.
However, be argue cons. Air travel has some positive thing. The first, is time, today airplane has a big speed (900 km/h), it in 10 faster then all exict alternative. For a lot of people time very important, but if cost tise, people can’t buy ticket. To example: air travel to parent or to work. Globalitation today doesn’t given the chance to live in one location. Always travel given us positive emotional. Governments should helps business to create eco-airplain, too.
As a result, this problem has two point of view, If this statements to compare, we should says, that global warming and air pollution more dangerous and have more negatives consinqunces then positive from air travel. However; laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure isn’t the best solution, but easy solutions. And governments needed to compare all pros and cons, because in west Europe hasen’t problem with transport, without ban or reduce transport; it is the complex problem and should solution quick.

The most crimes are committed by young people. In this essay I am going to try to suggest some solutions which could help to prevent this problem.

There are a lot of factors which involve on teenager's behaviour. But the most popular one is media. Teenagers spend most of their free time on the internet or wathing different TV programs. There are a lot of violence and crimes there which are shown like a real life and when young people watch this they try to immitate it. However, as for solution I can suggest that parents must control what their children watch and try to explain that this series or TV programs are just for entertainment and they should not copy behaviour from the antagonists of different TV series. Nevertheless, the good guys in the TV programs always win and fight with bad guys.
Another factor which has got a huge affort are computer games. Scientits say that computer games have got a lot of advantages, but also disadvantages, for example agressive behaviour. Ten years ago happend one thing that a schoolboy spent many time playing GTA Vice City. It is the most violence videogame. Moreover, he stolen the car and than killed about 5 policemen. This occasion shows us how videogames affort on teenager's minds and parents should control their childer what their are doing.

To sum up I would like to say that parents should control what their children do and teachers should provide deifferent lesson which help schoolboys or schoolgirls do not participate in different crime syndicates.",65,2,1

In my opinion, they should not.
Nowadays there are many different professional fields in the society. Every of them has its own features ans peculiarities. Doctors, teachers, engineer, builders – all this specialties includes not only the professional knowledges and skills, but also gender characteristics. There are many stereotypes and examples of existance only man and woman professions. Almost all my friends-boy study and work in the technical and physical spheres, while girls prefer social professions such as sociologist, journalists and so on, from my point of view it’s right and very widespread situation. So it is the first reason why it is not neccssary to accept the same quantity of male and female students in every subject. 
The second reason is that because of the descrimination of woman in the east countries, they do not have opportunity to work in some spheres. More than that in Russia and, maybe, in other modern countries, some employers are used to give work with computers, instruments, etc. to man. Due to this fact some woman woman with education in such field can stay unemployment.
To sum up these arguments I consider that the discussion about the equal number of woman and man in every subject  should stay only in theory. Moreover, to my mind, it is not so important to pay so much attention to sex of the students. I believe that more important significance for accepting the students to the universities is their level of knowledge and education that can be measure by test, interview and what not.

In my opinion, there are so many humans, who cannot buy legal version of film or music, because they have finanshial problems. Especially it is happened in poor countries, where a law of publishing is not exist and everyone can download everything he/she want from pirate resourses. How to punish all of population.

Hence, there are both benefits and drawbacks in such a situation. In this essay I will describe my own stance on this highly significant problem.
From my point of view, this tendency has more disadvantages than positive sides.To begin with, with the development of large multinational brands it is becoming drastically complicated for small start-ups to gain the popularity and become highly appealling to potential customers. For example, people who are used to do shopping in huge shopping malls are not likely to choose a small company or shop to buy something for themselves. Another disadvantage that I can distinguish is that because of this tendency small local bussinesses are prone to lose their culture and some unique features. For instance, when you come to any touristic place in Europe and come to a local shop, there are not many local goods or symbols of the country you have come - there are just post cards or some really ordinary clothes, hence if you want to get some national spirit, you should get acquainted with the locals.
However, there are also some pros in this kind of situation. To be more precise, nowadays there are plenty of shopping malls where everybody regardless of their social class can find everything they want. I mean that even though there is a gap between classes, anybody can be as smart and fashionable as others. Undoubtedly,in small local businesses there are quite peculiar goods, but they are far cheaper than in malls, hence you will look less appealling than people who do shopping in such shops. Though, I still suppose that you are more appealing when you are unique.
All things considered, I genuinely believe the trend of losing small local bussinesses` popularity is rather dismal and I would be really pleased if this situation could be changed.",65,2,1

That is why, the authority ough to decrease this influence by laws, which solve the problem with unnecessary flights. I agree with this point of view, but it is stupendous to bear in mind that no all airplanes provide the issue.

Firstly, due to produced gas and waste, the air travel became a source of air, water and noise pollution. Nowadays it is impossible to live near such kind of buildings because of a dangerous impact on out health. So, the best way to improve the situation is changes in the laws.

Secondly, the train is a great alternative for airplans and other air transport in many cases. It is cheaper and more comfortable. Moreover, there are unpopular directions, in which the tickets are not bought a lot. So, it could be decrease the number of these travel by laws in order to best fulling of people.

On the other hand, due to technical progress there are modern versions of air transport that reduce the amount of gas and harmful waste. If goverment invest in this project, it is not necessary to not allow air travel.

However, too serious changes can cause drawbacks. In this essay I will try to describe how the problem can be solved. Firstly, the problem isn’t widely known. Even though a lot of people care about ecology, they will still use air travel, because they didn’t know that it harms the environmental. So, governments should use social advertising to make the problem commonly known. Secondly, nowadays air travelling is the cheapest and the fastest way to get to any destination. It is often fair even for small distances expensive taking larger taxes ( as an example) this would weaken the economy, because modern economy is highly depended on developed transport system. Therefore the only way is developing other kinds at transportation for example trains. Good examples are japan thing and some European countries, where train system is modern and relatively cheap and train can alternate up to 800 km/h. furthermore, governments should also stimulate companies to invest in projects that develop eco-friendly plains. For example, there already is a plain that contribute minimum fuel using solar energy. The salienty can hardly exist without air travel, it should be developed to become more ecological. To sum up, the society nowadays is highly depends in air travel even though it is harmful for environment, government activity should be aimed on long-term benefit, so that society wouldn’t has economical issues and won’t cause dramatic changes in the environment. So the governments politics shouldn’t be aimed only in reducing the amount of air travel, because the main goal is developing the technology.

For example, to use the local people who need job, such model of business has a lot of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it is very beneficial in the modern world. Firstly, it helps developing countries to involve the process of globalization. Secondly, the economy of such countries develops with the growth of foreign investments. Thirdly, this model of business creates a lot of work places and fights the unemployment which is a very serious problem especially for developing countries. For instance, there were a lot of unemployed people in Arabic countries during the first half of 20th century. Then the oil source were explored and many foreign companies moved business there and Arabic countries started to develop very fast and solved the problem of unemployment. N the other hand, such a movement of business takes workplaces from the countries this business comes. For example, when “Apple” moved their factories to Asia a lot of workers in America became unemployed. Another disadvantage is that the developing countries may become dependent of the foreign business and as a result of the foreign country. Furthermore, businessmen usually do not pay local workers as much as they would pay in their own country. This is rather profitable but unhonest to people who work for them. To sum up, this system of business movement helps both businessmen and developing countries. Of course, there are some negative consequences but such model is just a part of globalization, the process which cannot be stopped. As a result poor countries should use all of the advantages of it and try to reduce the disadvantages, which, in my opinion, do not outweigh the disadvantages.

On the one hand, too much time in prison for people who did not, for example, a murder, is not good because all prisoners are people too, and they also should have rights. On the other hand, if prison sentences were very long people would avoid prison and they would do less crimes.

One of them is the fact that there is no variety of products on the market. If all small businesses stop functioning, our world will be like copied and pasted millions of times. People will be wearing the same clothes, living in the same apartments, driving the same cars.

Personally, I totally disagree with this point of view. Despite the fact I am always allow many theories and opinions about any questions, it is exception, because I do not reason for accepting such a system. Conversely, there are some arguments which contadict it.
First of all, it is scientifically proved that there are obvious differences between brains of human being. Some part of humanity is more succesful in analysis and counting, other part is more talented in arts and communication. And the proportions depends on gender too. So, if system will be applied, more talented people can lose their places in universities.
The second reason is that actual system is working: males are more efficient and succesful in their own spheres of economy and females in theirs. To my mind, nothing can prevent or stop extinction of stereotype of  dependance of gender on people lives. As for me, it is irrational to change something if it works correctly.
The third argument in favor of my opinion is about devastating effect on economic system. Employers would still try to find qualified and talented managers among males and skillful cooks among females. So there will be the deficite of working places.
To sum up, it is worth noticing that this question is not quite interesting or controversial for me.  Moreover, it is evident for me that such kind of system will not be applied anywhere, because government values the economy of the country much higher than tolerance and gender equality.

Many people prefer wathing variable sport events or sports on TV. But some individuals claim that doing this is a useless spending of time.
I absolutely agree with this arguement. First of all, when watching someone succeeding, you personally are doing nothing. I strongly believe that every person should imrove himself and not follow someone's success. Our free time is a perfect capability to do something useful, to become better and stronger, to even start doing sport by yourself. Not only watching sports is a waste of time, but it also takes a lot of money, because some sport events may be pretty expensive. That is why, I think, developing yourself is much more vital and significant, than watching someone plays football or bowling, for example.
The second thing is that addiction to sports among population increases governmental payment. I agree, that doing sports is the main point in every sportsman's life and he wants to be needed and paid. But, in my opinion, usually athlets are overpaid. In my country, there is a very important problem of eledrly people, ill children and others. Unfortunately, many people are strongly needed to buy remedies and to be cared, but the greates sums of the country's budget go to our football team salary. I totally disagree with this type of politics, that is why I think, that wathcing TV games or going to sport events regularly just makes sportsmen very rich and common people poorer.
In conclusion i would like to add, that every person can do any activity he wants, but i strongly suggest, that watching sports rather than even just doing it by yourself is a useless waste of time.We should imrove our minds and bodies every day and minute, doing something useful by yourself is moch more important.",65,2,6

Frankly speaking, a boom in the number of sports facilities won’t make an expected change as such places can attract the majority of already fit citizens. Therefore, everyone should make their own contribution to the health improvement. For instance, people might use bicycles instead of private cars to loose weight and breather the fresh air on the way to work. Moreover, social institutions shoul introduce a variety of outdoor cources and trips to make teenagers and, perhaps, their parents to spend time neither surfing the internet nor watching TV. Even organization of sports events can result in reduction of some illnesses. Furthermore, governments may impose a special tax for high-fat food.

There are some problems and solutions of them.

Firstly, most of modern gadgets, which people use in everyday life, have a bright display. Frequent interaction with bright light and small signs affect on human health. It leads to a lot of different eye deseases and problems in nervous system. Moreover, every day we are surrounded by many kinds of radiation, such as wi-fi or mobile phones. Scientists haven’t researched enough is it harmful for health of not yet. Besides, when a person is surrounded by different gadgets he become distracted, annoyed and stressed and it affects on a health in a bad way. For example, it is very hard to keep an attention on work, when mobile noties interrupt in your work process, it leads to increasing level of anxiety.

This problems can be solved in many different ways. For example, the first problem have the simplest solution – to wear a special glasses and use harmful gadgets lees frequent. The second one is more difficult. Scientists should research electricity pylons, which have a bad influence on people, who also live nearly there. The another solution is more personal. If every person could control their own use of modern technologies and consciously use it less, total level of stress, depression and suicides decreased dramatically. 

In conclusion, widespread of modern technology leads to bad health, bu it can be solved by government and people themselfs.

This social network is mostly used by people,whose age is about 30-49 and it makes up only 30% of people living in USA. The chart shows that Facebook is more popular among young people,whose age is about 18-29, and this network is used by almost 90% in comparisson with Instagram, which is used only by 53 %.

On of the most striking thing is that USA use much more money for developing the book market compared to any other country. It spent about 10,5 billion US dollars in this sphere of print in 2014, while in UK it was just 2,6 billion US dollars.
Additionally, the UK's market shows the lowest amount of money for eBook in 2014, however it rises by 2018 and reaches the second point (after USA). It increases from 1,8 to 2,3 billion US dollars.
Another thing that is viewed is that in every country there is a stable positive development of eBook market. For example, China spend only 0,5 billion US dollars in 2014, while in 2018 it grows to 1 billion US dollars, according to the forecast.

Besides, genes have much more impact on our personality and development.
As a student of sociology faculty, I can not agree with the scientists completely although I admit that both the characteristics we are born with and experiences we may have in our life have some influence. In my opinion and the sociological point of view, the socialisation during our life and especially in our childhood plays the leading role in forming our personality characteristics. There are a lot of examples when two twins who lived in different families could not understand each other when they had met because of differences in their values and life understanding.
Not only sociologists, but also psychologists strongly believe that it is very important for children to live in a good family and communicate with kind, polite and intelligent people while growing up, because it will influence and enhance his life in the future. In addition, I have to tell that most children who were socialised in the streets and communicated with bad companies in their childhood could not became successful and wealthy people. Meanwhile, children from poor families who communicated with children from wealthy families had more chances to enter the university and had a better job later. So the genes can be a bit neutralised by a good socialisation tactic.
In conclusion I have to say that, in my opinion, both the characteristics we are born with and the experience in our life have a great impact on our personality, but our personal experience and the society we live in influence more considerable.

Some people like it, the others claim that government should prevent us from this artists because they can hurt us, so they think that artist should express their views according to rules, laws.
To begin with, I want to note that we live in literal society where the freedom of expression is one of the most important statement in the Constitution. So, artists could express their view in whichever way they wish. Moreover, maybe society will love such an extraodinary ways like graffity. For example: the story of Banxy. He started to paint graffity on different buildings in London. However, British laws permitted to do it, so he did not write his name and nobody know who he is until ourdays. His graffity paints were so magnificent that British government decided to call them art and made some exhibitions on them. Nowaday people are wonder of Banxy's paints and pay a lot of money for tickets.
However, there are people who think differently. They claim that government should restrict artist from an extraodinary ways of expression their own ideas. They think that all graffity paints garbage view of their town. They argue that freedom of expression hurt their own freedom and their life safety. Moreover, they say that artists' ways of expression their views can hurt ideas of normal people. For eample, we can remember of the story of ""Pussy Riot"". They wanted to sign bad songs in the Jesus Christ Cathedral, however, they did not think about other people, so they were accested and sent to the prison. The huge part of our society think that it was right desicion.
To sum it up, I want to note that if artist want to express himself he should first think about other people attitude and only then try to express himself in different ways.

In USA situation is quite the same. In 1940 the amount of people older than 65 was about 8-8%, but then it begins to increase and in 1980 it gets the 15% and in 2040 it may be approximately 24%.

But some people say, that there should be a list of restrictions, which would stay artists 'hands' under the governmential control.
To begin with, I would like to say, that for me there is only one point 'for' the government restricyions. And this point is that for some 'creative artists' the art could lay in the sphere that could cause some demage to the society, especially in the multicultural countries or countries with the parochial system of values. For example, you shouldn't perform naked and bleeding somewhere in a tiny russian village, where there is still no culture of using and showing your body for the other reasons except for the hard-work.
As far as I concerned, my other arguments are going to be the voice of freedom that should be given to the artists.
At first, we should never forget about one of the main cut point of democratic society - the right to be free in expressing your opinion whichever way you wish. Artists can't be excluded, cause putting under 'arrest' their own feelings will not give them a chance to make a real art, which always a piece of creating. Moreover to say, having government restrictions for art means that there is a rule of autocracy, which brings all the culture under government propaganda and denies people's right of getting a full variety of information and makes people blind. It is well accepted that an artist would never 'born' a real art being under pressure, never know what to expect.
To conclude with, I trully believe that creative artists should be able to act the way they want being free, except those cases which could harm the society or distabelise it.

However, some people argue that there are plenty of better options to prevent people from comitting crimes. There is no doubt that making the punishment more severe, the government will decrease the number of criminals. The fear of spending a great part of their lives in prison will make potential criminals think twice whether the benefits they get from commiting a crime are worth the risk. Beside this preventive effect, there is an equally important one: if the sentences are longer, criminals will be isolated from the society for a longer time, which would have a great positive effect on the safety of citizens. However, it cannot be denied that this measure is not enough and has some disadvantages. The more people are in prison, the more funds the government (and, thus, the taxpayers) has to spend on them. Another ways of preventing people from commiting crimes should be used. Another problem is that many people believe that such strict measures should not be used in working with juvenile criminals which are not mature enough for being fully responsible for their actions. Some criminals are not dangerous for the society. To sum up, I can say that making the punishments stricter and the sentences longer is an effecting way to reduce crime, but not the very humanistic and economically reasonable one. The government should make sentences for some kind of crimes longer, but, all in all, it is only one of the measures it has to take, and more alternative ways to reduce crime should be applied.",65,2,2

However, it may be not the only way to do that, but apparently, not the merciest one. It is also known that some people, who get in the prison in a young age, more likely will get there again. That is why the level of crime is enourmous in such areas where there are more people, who have been in a jail.
On the one hand, it is logical, that longer sentences may stop people from doing crime. Apparently, when someone knows that by stealing something he will only be put in a jail for several month it may be not as effective as if someone knows that he will be there for several years. Still, as far as I understand it, any person who decides to do a crime, does not believe really that he will be captured.
On the other hand, I believe that people will more likely never do a crime if they are not pushed to it by the environment and society around them. If there is a kid, who grows up in a criminal area or even criminal family, sometimes, even not wanting to do so, he has no other ways to survive there, than doing a crime. Moreover, by puting this kid in a jail and not giving him help there and thereafter to socialise and find a normal job and people to interact with, will most likely make him a life-long prisoner. Of course, if the sentences will be longer, it will be even harder to make a normal and socialised person out of him.
In the conclusion, I would like to say that I believe there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce the crime level, such as rising the education level and providing psychological support for anyone, especially for those, who live in the cities and areas with a high level of crime and drug-addiction. These ways seem to be more and, moreover, will help those people to fully become a part of the society we live in.",65,2,4

Others argue, and say that this will have a little impact on the problem and we need to find other ways out. So who is right? Let us find it out.
The first thing worth mentioning is that health is not only about doing sports. It is obvious that increasing the number of sports available will definetely help to some local areas, whereas the metropolitan areas will still be untouched because people are too busy there and the only way to improve their health is changing their lifestyles. The suggested solution has some advantages, but, unfortunately, this is not the case.

In this essay I will point out some reasons of it and suggest solutions to resolve this problem.
Firstly, the reason of youth crime may be the media. A lot of violence is shown on TV: there are a lot of movies where criminals are shown as heroes. Teens are vulnerable, they look at this and try to imitate this. So, the media just put them on the wrong path this way.
The solution to this problem is simple. First of all, parents should take control of what their child watches. They should not allow their children to watch too much television during the day and try to organize their free time, so that the
Secondly, the reason of increasing of youth crime may be the high consumption of drugs and alcohol between the youngsters. This makes the psychic of a young person unreasonable and they easily can commit a crime or do other bad things.
First of all, again parents must protect their child from this by controlling his behavior. Also teachers at school may try to influence their pupils by making special meetings, debates.
To sum up, unfortunately, crime committed by young people is a common problem of 21st century. There are several reasons for it, and some actions should be taken to preserve it. Parents and teachers are mostly in favor of influencing young people as they spend a lot of time with them and they have enough experience to help young people choose the right way and not to ruin their life by becoming a criminal.",65,2,0

The smallest percentage of all goods is related to non-metallic minerals on the first picture (approximately 4%) and machinery (2%) on the second.

But not so many people think about how much money musicians and film producers lose because of illegal sowrces of their product.

On the one hand, some people think that people who don’t want to pay money for music and films and try to find them for free should be punished. Their position is clear, because of course people who create all these things got nothing for lots of time, money and talent they needed to create that or another song or film, which is not really honest. Also illegal copies bring lots of money to their owners, who in fact do nothing but copying the material created by others, so film producers and musicians have to deal with money problems connected with their art; whereas other people who don’t work as much as they are and just cell their works become very rich.

But on the other hand, illegal copies of music and films can be a good advertisement of people who created them. For example, you won’t pay much money to go to a concert of a musician, whose art you don’t know really well, but if it’s your favorite singer, whose songs you’ve accidently found in the Internet, of course you’ll buy a ticket even if it costs  a lot. Also pirate copies can help people became noticed. Lots of famous musicians were found with the help of illegal audios of their works, which somebody published in his website. So sometimes people share their art for free themselves to become popular and reach success. 

To talk about myself, I agree with the second position, because it’s very difficult to become popular and, what is more important, stay popular only with the help of legal sources of your art. Today, in the 21st century, people are addicted to the Internet, they find everything there and can’t live without it. So it’s wrong to stop it.

It takes a lot of talent and knowledge to develop the necessary equipment, and huge sums of money too. Governments of the biggest countries make investments in exploring the space outside planet Earth, and it leads to a question: wouldn't it be better to focus on the problems around us, make people's lives on Earth better, and solve the planet's issues before looking up into the space?
Science and inventions are what made the humanity move fordward for centuries. Space exploration is one of the newest fields and there is still a lot to be done and found out. The technologies developed by space explorers may later be used in everyday life, they help environmentalists to protect the planet from destroying processes such as global warning.
One of the goals set by space explorers is to find a way to leave the planet if something goes wrong and save the humanity at least partly. I suppose this is not the best goal because we should focus on preventing such a situation and caring about everybody's lives instead of making sure there is a way to escape for some outstanding individuals.
Also there is a big wealth gap in the society and people who work in very closed and technological fields, such as space exploration, clearly have a higher income. As for me the problem of poverty can be fixed by a more balanced income rate in different professional fields.
So personally I can neither agree nor disagree with the given opinion. I don't think there should be a choice between space exploration and poverty or environmental issues as different ways to spend money.

The most important problem is that modern children have a weak health because of sitting at their home and not doing anything in clean air. For example, they can study at their home by online coursec, to buy food and goods by the Internet, to take part in different evidence. Moreover, modern technologyes impact on the people's psychology system. People become addicted by their phones, computers, games like a drugs and can not to understand what is real or not. It caused that the people can kill themselves or other people, thinking that it is fantasy game. Futhermore, it is significant that today people have more problem s with their eyes and with other important organs because they always site near the different computers or radiote instrument and do not do any physical exercises to improve their abilities. Modern technologies do everything for people and do not give opportunities to develop and strengh their health.

Secondly, decrease of import products may has really bad impact on some countries.

Nevertheless, it can be noticed that in the Middle East and in Latin America columns, which are about unemployment rate in 2015, have become lower: the decrease was from 11 to 9,6 in the Middle East, and the gap between numbers in Latin America is 1%. The situation is getting worse only in one region (the EU) as column has grown since 2014. It can be connected with migration crisis. The highest level of unemployment can be found in the North Africa (12,5%), but it is still at the same level. The best situation is in the South Asia, where it is only 3,9% unemployment.

However, others, and I am among them, disagree with this idea. First of all, people in prisons live in very poor conditions and under very strict rules which they have to obey, the get bad food and they can be hitted by their roommates or even by policemen. I believe that living in such conditions can not affect person in a good way, he or she will not be better after all prison sentence even if it is longer, and we definitely can not claim that after the prison this thief or a merder won't commit a crime again. Moreover, if people want to deter crime, they have to understand why and how crimes are committed. The government and the police need to think about selling weapons and other tools that can cause people dying, it must be very restricted. Thurthermore, there are a lot of organizations which helps many peolpe all around the world to fight with their psyco problems when they face them. I think this help also will be relevant for prisoners, because many of them comitted crimes for such psycological reasons. For example, I read a text about a man who had some problems with his health, espesially with nervological system. He comitted a murder, but at that moment he hadn't realised what he had been doing, all his family was shocked they did not want to believe in this. The court sent him to prison for 25 years. However, in prison his illness appeared in a very cruel way. One day it was decider to send him to the special hospital, where educated specialists from different countries helped him. And he was free after 14 years as a healthy man without any diseas and not after 25 years as it was planned innitially. Thus alternative method was more effecient in this situation that the prison sentence. To sum up, I would like to say that alternative ways of reducing crime have more benifits than drawbacks, and not every person has to be sent in prison for longer time in order to understand his fault.",60,2,3

Governments have an opportunity to support local films, but there is a question about its necessarity.
Firstly, these people definitely has reasons to watch other country's films and ignore local products. Probably their country makes bad quality films having no plot, with absolutely non-talanted cast. In this case inhabitans will watch films they like more. It is easy to find something special from a great number of British and American films. Moreover, film industry in America is the greatest one, so it is sponsored well and has an experience in producing the best films in history.
However, it would be a nice idea to give a chance to local films. It is hard to make a good film which can be compared with Hollywood's products, if you have not enough money. If government wants to lead their film industry to the first place, it should support local movie makers, but not all of them. As far as I am concerned, some films do not deserve supporting with money because of its lack of ideas. Money cannot change the plot or give a talant for some actors. A well-sponsored film will probably have a huge level of graphic design, wonderful costumes and ubiquitous advertisment, but it is not the main reasons to call some film great. A good film contains an exciting plot and cast which makes you feel all things that is describing in the film by yourself.
People usually choose British and American films for watching because of some reasons. It is important to support local film industry in order to make it better, but not all of them, as far as not all of local films have a bad quality only because of lack of money.",70,2,5

It can be called a most important one task to solve due to its original specifications. What things can be changed in order to do it? First of all, the step of determination have to be mentioned. It is widely known that child always pure. And if the problem exists in the family, it is parents guilt. No matter when the issue happened, parents someday made a mistake in their relation to child. So, the most effective way to solve the problem is to spent more time with their childrens. It is simple way on the first glass, but it is absolutely not easy to do. People should what is more valuate for them – their little creation or work. They have to remember that child has its own world and if parents will be outside this area, something really bad happens. Work and career is not a real being, it cant think and feel emotions, it doesn’t need someones love as childrens do. All the problems are solvable here. The second way, is suitable mostly for teenagers and grown-ups. They sometimes can be really angry and cold to their parents. After many years of silence and dealing with the issue their attention became much more bad. It is important to break the ice, forget and let go old situations. Clear view on their parents, understanding of their world, full of career, their own problems and meaning actions can solve problem in a neutral way. After this neutral level both parents and childrens have to go to a positive level. Remember some funny situations, they experienced together, or discuss some interesting for them themes. Taking everything into account, I therefore conclude that attention and care are two ways to sucess and solve this important problem.

We also know that the works of creative artists are sometimes rather provocative and controvertial. There is an important argue between those, who believe that artists should be governmentally restricted in their ideas and others, who think they should be given the freedom to creative.
In my point of view, poets, actors and other creative people can have an opportunity to pronounce their ideas and show them in the works of art.
Firstly, according to the constitution, all people can express their own opinion in the way they like (this is also about the creative people). Secondly, if the government control the arts, it would be really boring to look on the works of art (from pictures of films) because of the equality of them.
Some people believe that creative people are an example for the young generation and they should educate them. That is why they must show happiness, love and kindness in their works of art. I cannot really agree with this point of view because I strongly believe that the young generation should know all the sides of our life, not only good ones.
In conclusion, I would like to add that such parts of our live as films, music, pictures must be out of the government controll because all people need to express their feelings and thoughts freely and works of art are spectacular way of it.

A huge amount of people, especially teenagers, users social media for an exchange of information and knowledge on a daily basis. However, some people argue that the main aim of these networks is entertainment. This essay will look on both sides of an argument. Let us begin by outlining the main arguments of the opinion, that social media is for sharing information. First of all, with the help of social media you can gain knowledge from any part of our planet. For instance, everyone can communicate with foreighers, learning different languages with native-speakers. What is more, social networks save us the bother of spending time on calling. Today access to the Internet is cheaper than phone calls and it’s faster to book hotel from Facebook rather than calling the reception. In addition to this, using Facebook or Vkontakte give us an opportunity to check news with one click as it is highlighting by editors in special public groups. Turning to the other side of an argument, social networks are considered as entertainment feature and nothing else. Firstly, social media give users an access to a huge database of music and videos, which is considered by many people as the most important advantage for them to use it. Secondly, social networks take a lot of time, and encourage people to spend time in sufficiently. That’s why some people prefer not to use them on a regular basis, but simply for entertaining yourself. All things considered, I think that social media has changed people’s lives a better way, but they should also spend their time on other activities.

By contrast, the number of people which prefered the desktop version decreased, yet, not dramatically: from approximately 150 millions of users to around 135 millions.  Speaking about the reasons for using Facebook, it can be stated that sharing photos and videos was the most significant reason for both men and women; however, this answer was more popular among women and was chosen by 54 % of them. Similarly, women proved to be more interested in seeing funny posts than men (43 % and 35 % respectively) and significantly more interested in learning about ways to help others (35 % and 25 % respectively).

It is might be true to say, that illegal drugs get into the sport system. Some athletes use drugs to reach better results, however it is not illegal. There are different views on what should have been done after athletes had been caught. In this essay the views of both sides of this problem will be examined carefully.
Firstly, it is very important to understand that some illegal drugs may be just a medical treatment for athletes, who have some problems with health. In this case they do not try to do something illegal, so the government should more carefully study all kind of drugs to know, which are legal and which are not. This is a viable argument for people, who tend to believe, that the penalty in such case should be not so furious. I strongly have the same point of view.
However, there are people, who think in another way. If a sportsmen uses drugs ones, he will probable do it again. That is why he must be banned from sport for the rest of his live. The whole system of sport competition will brakedown, unless each sportsman has a medical test before the competition. Moreover, we must remember the fact, that the sport system relates on money. The goverment pays a lot of money to winners. So if such athletes become winners illegaly, goverment will unfairly lose money from the budget.
In conclusion, we must take into the consideration both views. I strongly think that the penalty should be not so crucial, however the obvious fact that the penalty must be in all cases.

On this picture we can see the changes in four countries in 2014 with a forecast for 2018 which are connected with a book market.
First of all, the print market is more popular than eBook market at all, but in some countries like USA in 2018 or UK in 2018 shows us another results. In China and Germany we can see the difference more better. The greatest development of the book market shows the USA. In 2014 the print market increased to 10,5 Billion US Dollars. The most balanced country in the development is the UK. If we talk about print market, the most balanced is in Germany. It is about 6 billion US Dollars. In 2014 the print market is more popular than in 2018. In contrary, the eBook is more famous and developed in 2018 than in 2014. It is logical because of new technologies in our modern world.

I am complitely disagree with this idea because wise import and export of food benefits the country.

First of all, food export is a economically beneficial strategy. If a country can produce more than consume, it always can earn extra money for a budget by selling food to neighbours. Secondly, food import spreads natural resourses among all mankind. Obviously, that some countries can not produse some kind of food due to the location orl weather factors, but they can get it in exchange for money or othe resourses from other countries. Moreover, rich nations can help poor ones by sending them food, if government understand that they have far more that they need. This logic also works in case of helping population suffering from natural disasters. At last, food import allow citizens to taste foreign cuisine, and full writing can make population more happy and healthy.

To sum up, there are enough arguments to say, that food import and export is benefitial for country in many ways. Presumably, closing the food traffic and consentraiting only at covering population needs – is a dead end for almost every country development.

First of all, I think, there are many subject which are more interesting for boys, or which are more easier for girls. For example, men like engeneering more then arts, so many boys want to study engeneering. In this situation, if Universities should accept equal number of male and female students, it will be impossible for some boys to study what they want.
Futhermore, to my mind, in some countries there are not equal number of men and women. So if there are much more women in this country, it will be impossible to organize the same number of male and female students in every subject.
However, some people suppose that equal amount of boys and girls in every subjects make possible to have different specialists in one way, because man and woman have different ways to solve the problems. But In my opinion, there are a lot of only man’s professions today, and it is not necessary for women try to work in them.
Finaly, I want to say that in all Universities all over the World there are not equal number of male and female students in every faculty and in every subject. And I believe that it is right system, because everyone have a chance to study where he/she want and it is not depend on gender.

Workers of these industries are damaged by such unlawful actions because they lose enormous amount of profit. Individuals downloading files in such way are thought to be criminals, who must bear responsibility for this. I absolutely agree with this point of view and will discuss it in this essay.
First of all, creating of a movie or recording an audio track takes lots of money, as well as time. Moreover, a huge amount of people should be involved in this process. As a result, producers of this product have to spend the huge part of the budget on wages. So, in order to gain some profit, they need their rights to be protected. People, coping and sharing the result of their work for free, in fact, steal their money, as it was a pocket. That is why they must be punished as ordinary thefts.
Secondly, there are lots of special laws, which restrict distribution of non-original films and music. So, people who do it automatically become criminals. Moreover, buying discs from pirates means supporting their illegal actions. Consequently, buyers or people downloading films or music on the Internet also break the law and become guilty.

That is why it is very important thing to contribute education. But nowadays people have to face with different problems in this area. One of it is the warniry about numbers of male and female students in every subject. Many people believe that universities should accept as many boys and girls.
I really disagree with this statement. In my opinion, gender is not the most significant thing in the question of acception to universities. First of all, we should to pay attention of knowledge of student in the area where he would like show his possibilities. Moreover, we should not forget about interests and wishes of each student. I believe that, if someone really want to achieve great results, he will do it. Of course, no one can deny the fact that hardworking is not the last thing in achieving results. In this way, I would like to give an example from my life. My sister is really fond of jurisprudence. And her wish was to be accepted to the Moscow university. And she was because of her every day work, reading and true interest in low.
However, some people do not agree with me. My friend, for example, think that our society need both male and female specialists. He sure that this factor will develop economy of the country. The reason of his opinion is that male and female use different ways in working. But I do not support him. In my view, gender is just physical thing which has no influence on anything.
To sum up, it does not have a mean if you are a boy or a girl. It is only the question of your wishes, work and possibilities.

But crime rise and many people find such way to reduce it.
Some poeple think that reducing crime is to give longer priosin sentences. I think that it is not a good way. Because there are a lot of people who do not want to work. They have not a flat and they do not want to live in the street. Now there are a lot of prisons in Russia because there are a lot of people who have a long time to sit there.And simple russians who works pay the percent from their summaries. I consider that it is not right.
At first the prison are not good and people who sit up there the long time became worse than they were. And when they go out they may do the worst thing in their life.
There are some countries where are not prison or the quality of prison are very comfortable. In my mind it is a good thing.
I consider that better place helps such people to stand up in a right way.I think that the teachers of school subjects must be there. They can help people to improve knowleges and to be a good people.

They separetes in two groups. One group thinks that the best way to reduce crimes is to give long prison sentences.Another group thinks that they become better if they are given alternative methods of reducing crime.
The first method can be effective, but it does not give us the garantie of their changes. They can have a long prison sentence, be in prison, make there works, hard works and after that, for example,after 25 years, they will not realise what they have done bad, for them it can be only a crime and they can do it one more time. Also, I do not want to say that all people behave themselves at the same way. After a long prison time they can be better, because they want to forget that bad time and live a new life.
Others think about alternrtive methods. Yes, it can be effective, they can realize what they have done, but they can think if they killed one person and do not have prison sentences, they will can kill another person and will not have a punishment. The same situation with changes can be and in this sutuation when the prisoner has an alternitive punishment and after that way of reducing crime they can be more lifefriendly and want to forget all this time.
In my opinion, I think that better way to reduce the crimes is to give longer prison sentenses. For me, Killer, Who killed a lot of people, must be in a prison, because I do not want that one of them was among us. It is dangerous for people. Also, I think that every person would like to punish this person who killed someone, because bad emotions Fulfill us and we want give to this killer all, that can give him the same felling that we have at this bad moment.",60,2,5

Some people claim that this process is a crime as you steal someone’s product of intellectual property and the crime should be punished. I partly agree with this position though this situation is not clear enough. 

To begin with, I strongly agree with the fact that pirate copie is a theft because, as told by the legal law, the process of film copying is not legal as well as people involved in film-making and music-making are not getting payed for. Their job properly as their salaries are mostly based on the box office for tiloms and wages from sales of music tracks, vinyl and CD-disks for music tracks. In my opinion, as far as every job should be payed and due to the fact of respect for the musicians and film producers people should purchase such things. The fact is that all commercial artists claim for restrictments in this law-sphere. 

The part about punishing people for downloading pirate copies is the part I should disagree with. I think that these people are less guilty than those one who made a copy and even if there is a place for punishment it should not be too tough. It might be a good lesson if the person would be asked to get the legal copy and that would be enough. Besides, not every person on Earth have enough money even for Food and such people can not be punished for the interest in self-educating.

To summarize all the points I stated here, I came to the conclusion that downloading products of someone’s intellectual property at least is not fair. This theft cannot be left unnoticed but the biggest part of it is in hand of the “pirate” himself while the punishment for the downloaders should be minimal.

However, many viewers prefer British or American cinema to local pruducers. To change the situation, some suggest that government should financially support local film industries. But is it a reasonable thing to do?

To begin with, the most obvious reason for overwhelming popularity of American and British films is globalisation. By watching these films, the viewer is involved in global film-loving community, which speaks English at least as a second language, and have a global discussion about the films everybody on Earth is speaking about currently.
This is a thing which a non-English film production cannot overcome. However, it is possible to involve foreigners into our cinematography culture. To archieve it, it is a good thing to establish more cinematographic awards, where the films will be shown with English subtitles and where the overseas cinematographists will be invited to be among the judges.
By doing this, the local film production will have a fresh view on it, and the situations when the directors who know each other well will award each other nearly as friends will be impossible.
Moreover, it is essential to preserve and develop local cinematographic tradition.
In order to do this, it is neccessary to financially support cinema schools, where the new generation of the directors can be risen by the older one. Again, it is essential to invite foreign directors and students to exchange expirience.

On the other hand, in my opinion, financial support in the field of film-making itself sometimes (and often) does not have good results. It happens for the reason that the choice of films to be supported is often performed by people who are more interested in money and are not really connected with actual cinema. For example, a recent film about Russian YouTube bloggers was sponsored by Russian governmental structure, obviosly, due to the popularity of these people. Although huge money were involved into the project, it was not successful at all. Additionally, film inductry is not something that money of the citizens should be spent on. it is not fair when people pay money for something they clearly did not ask for and did not choose to watch. In addition, sometimes the government is trying to replace the dates of release of foreign films with the releases of local ones. For instance, that is what happening in Russia right now. In my view, on the contrary, it makes local film production more undesirible than it already is as this policy is definitely too aggresive.
All in all, I believe that it is important for government to support educational part of cinema world and to raise prestige of the local film production by establishing international awards. However, I strongly disagree with the point of view that local film production itself should be financially supported.",75,2,0

For the rail-transported goods the main share consists of metals (35%) and manufactured goods (25%). Also there are three nearly equal shares of machinery (12%), chemicals (12%) and food products (11%). The last part is held with non-metallic minerals. For the road-transported goods there are two big parts, too. Food products (30%) and manufactured goods (28%) are about 60% together. Also there are huge amount of chemicals and non-metallic minerals (16 and 13%), and metals are only 11% and machinery is only about 2%.
Summarising all of the above, we can see that metals and machinery are mostly transported by rail. Otherwise, food products and non-metallic minerals are transported by road more. In the end, chemicals has nearly the same share on the both diagrams, so it is transported by rail as often as by road.

As a result it could lead to developing countries become developed ones. Actually, some developing countries concentrate on some particular manufacturing sphere, for example agricultural. So if some international can manufacturer build a factory in this country, it will give additional income to the government. What is more, the amount of globless people could reduce because of new places to work. In fact, some people may prefer car manufacturing to agriculture, or they could be attracted by the salary of new job. Also, international companies are often multicultural and this quality could broaden horizonts of local people. However, there are some disadvantages in this kind of process as moving business to developing countries. For example, people could be shocked by the difference in countries life levels and decide to move to more developed countries. Actually, this is positive point, but if it turns into tendency, it could lead to some political and economical problems such as scientists leaving their motherland to find more paid job in some other countries, or overmigration in developed countries.

On the one hand, Some people believe that athletes caught using this substances should be banned for 2 years. There are some benefits of this opinion. To start with, if athlete do not know about different substances included in his meal, he will return in sport after 2 years period. For instance, we should not blame Maria Sharapova for using drugs (such as ""mildoniy""), as it was included in her medcine. Moreover, people who would like to use drugs should know that there is a panishment to prevent them do it. Finally, although some athletes think that using drugs there is no any impact on their health, it is proven by scientists that such substances influence on people's coordination, heartbeat and breathing. So the rule will probably prevent athletes from using drug and it will be beneficial for their health.
On the other hand, there are lots of people who claim that athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. Mostly such opinion is discussed among athlets. They do not want to compete with people who has been banned previously. Moreover, some people think that 2 year panishment is not really strict.
However, in my opinion, to ban athletes forever is not moral. As I said previously, sometimes they do not want use drugs by themselfs. Although they should be punished, the discvalification for the rest of the life can cause mental diseases and uncertainty.
To sum up, I strongly believe that thereis an issue of using drugs nowaday. However, we should prevent the production of these drugs and their distribution but not punish people forever. The 2-year period is enough to understand your mistake.

Regarding the highest level of tempereture, we can see that the temperature in Rio de Janeiro reaches its peak of 30 degrees above zero in January. Maximum temperature curve then dipps slightly to approximately 25 degrees in May, fluctuating during further 4 months just around 25 degrees (from May to September). Temperature rate rises steadily during 4 months till the end of the year, returning to its initial level of just around 30 degrees. Maximum temperature rate in Yakutsk starts with around 35 degrees below zero at the beginning of the year, increasing gradually to its highest level of around 25 degrees above zero in July, which is the warmest month of a year. Temperature curve declines during all 6 months left, falling down from plus 25 degrees to almost 35 degrees below zero.

Turning to the minimum temperature figures, we can notice, that the curve follows the same pattern in both cases, copying maximum rank curve's principle. While looking at the Rio's curve, it should be said, that the gap between maximum and minimum figures remains almost the same, having approximately 7 degrees distance. The highest minimum temperature is seen in February (just above plus 25 degrees), while the lowest is detected in July (around 17 degrees respectively).Yakutsk's minimum temperature line follows the same pattern as in the previous case: temperature rank plummets steadily from minus 40 degrees in January to just above plus 10 degrees in July, dipping to the initial level of 40 degrees below zero in December.

In summary, it can be concluded, that average temperature progress in Rio (Brazil) differs from Yakutsk's progress greately. Rio's temperature curve roughly remains at the same level during the whole year, fluctuating from 30 to 25 degrees of the maximum level and from 25 to 17 degrees of the minimum level respektively.Yakutsk's temperature curve has a marked peak both by the maximum and minimum temperature level in July.",70,1,0

It is obvious that that problem should be resolved but there are different opinion about the way of doing.  There a large group of people who consider the making the prison sentences longer is the best way to reduce the crime and there are both pluses and minuses in this theory. The advantage of this way is that probably the number of relapces would reduce. Also the fear of wasting time will be a good motivation not to brake the low. On the other hand, the sistem is not ideal and the people who were sentenced wrongly maybe would never have a chance to return to their previous lives. Moreover, the amount of prisoners would increase and it could be a problem becouse their keeping is not the cheepest thing. The other opinion is that there should be alternative ways to reduce crimes. For example, the agitation not commit the crimes which hepls prevent ptople from braking the low. May be the one more way is the financial support of people which would prevent them from stealing. This position is good but not all people commit the crimes because of need and not all have the concience and the feel of justice, so this way will not resolve the problem complitely. I think that we should combine both this ways but we shouldn't be fanatics. May be the punishments should be more strict but not too strict becouse it could brake someone's life. One more thing, upbtinging is quite important, so parents should talk with their children more. In out univercity the call center is given so if someone need support he or she can call and have help. One time my friend called their and had material support, which may be prevent her from commiting a crime. In conclusion I would like to say that in the battle with crimes we should we should use as our first weapon talks and understanding, suppoting and motivation, but only after that strict measures like a strict sentences.

However, in the past, people had more opportunities to spend time with them. Let’s try to find out the reasons of current situation.
First of all, parents have many possibilities to give their children to the kindergarden or a special all-day school. Fortunately, there are enough such places in the Moscow. Moreover, they can easily to call a nurse. In my point of view, people prefer to use such methods because they would like to make money for a living. Our times is hard because of crisis and sometimes parents haven’t got other choice. Secondly, sometimes people make a family in the young ages, when they are not ready to conduct a clear behavior for children. Therefore, parents have to spend almost their strength and time for working and studying. Talking about problems, I would like to note that the best way to give the right conditions of behavior is to show it on your own. Nevertheless, parents don’t give enough attention for it and allow their children to take habbits from other people. However, parents can’t be sure that children society is polite and have clear thoughts. Moreover, kids should feel that they are not in danger and their parents are always ready to help them to cope with different problems. In conclusion, it Is important to say that situation is changed in worse side. Parents are keen on their jobs and forget about the most crucial thing in the world – children, which requires their attention.

Actually some people are sure that if the government increases the quantity of places for doing sport, the aim stated will be reached, other think there are lots of other ways in deciding this problem. To begin with, people of the first group want more sport equipment. They say if the government will build special areas for sport and let people use it for free there will be more humans involved in sport process. The point of view is worth existing, because it can be seen in our city that if it is a new beautiful football field, for example, there are always some people playing the game mentioned. A lot of people want to do sport, but do not have facilities for playing games or just running. In contrast, other people claim that facilities are not so important. As far as they are concerned it is better to make people love sport. For example, beautiful and healthy girls and boys could be shown on TV. When a person sees perfect bodies, he or she wants to be similar to people, who have such bodies. Moreover, same leactures in school can be provided. These leactures should be devoted to utility of doing sport. If a child does sport from his or her childhood, he or she will probably do it all his or her life and learn to love sport young generation in future. What is more, there are possible decisions of people’s health problems from other sides. For example, it is a good idea of spreading information about cigarettes and alcohol harm. To sum up, I think it is better to work with people’s minds and make them understand pluses of doing sport instead of building new sport facilities, because the latter will influence people, but not so, efficiently as learning them to live healthy lives.

But some people believe that boys and girls should have the same number of places in every particular area of studing. I am deeply convinced that such an idea makes entering to the university unfair.
First and foremost, accepting equal number of people of different sex breaks the modern system to entering to the university which is based mostly on knowledge, will and labour of every particular student. If the person is better than the candidate of different sex , it will be unfair to her or him not to take the place only because of it. Secondly, nowadays there are many spheres where males or females do better, so there are more students of this sex on this subject in the universities. For example, it is thought that hard physical job is more suitable for mens and jobs which contribute the ability to care about children seem to be most female. So accepting equal numbers of male and female students creates the situation when all places of one sex are full, while in the same time the places for other six remain free. Moreover, as it has already said our modern society is believed to have equal rights for everybody which means that if someone would like to choose some subject he or she should be limited only by his or her own abilities and willignness to do it and the government has no rights to restrict it.
But on the other hand, girls seems to be more responsible, for their studies so usually they have better results of exams and so they have more opportunities to get a place in the university. Unsurprisingly, they would prefer more prestigious and well-paid subject, even if they are not interested in it. It makes the situation when talented boys cannot enter the university and girls do boring job for them. In such situation equal number of vacancies might be a good idea, but the situation should be first well explored and thoughts of employers and market situation should be taken into accant.
To sum up, I would like to say that I am mostly disagree with this suggestion because first of all it brakes person's rights and makes the process of accepting students kind of unfair. But in some cases such practice might be used but in the current situation should have an accurate observation.

To begin with, overuse of modern gadgets have caused numerous problems for people’s health, such as poor eyesite, gaining of some extra weight. However, the problems connected with the back are the most dangerous. Sitting long hours in one position in front of the screen weakens and practically curves our spine. Though this changes might not cause pain, they can result in serious damage to ones organism. For example, doctors discovered that sitting in one pose more than for 4 hours a day might lead to the carious problems with spine, which offects all the human organism unfavorably. 

Nevertheless, a number of measures can be taken to eliminate negative effects modern devices have on our back and health in general. Creating the additional sport centers is the foremost solution to this problem. Considering that a lot of people refuse going for sports, due to the lack of available facilities, building new sport centers will encourage them. This government might implement special programs in order to increase the number of sport facilities. For instance, the initiative called “Sports for everyone” was created for enhance sport infrastructure of our country, developing new objects for doing sports. This resulted in a rising number of  children choosing active way of life over the modern devices.

On the one hand, big brands really know how to deal with production, how to build big works and make a lot of products at short time period. It is also bettter for countries in which those works are located, because many locals can find a job for themself. Moreover, it is easy to control quality in big company, so you don need to create many different comissions. China can represent the example of country that was lucky.

To reduce problems with neck and back, people should do trainings, about 10 minutes every morning. Also they should fo massage courses twice a year to make their bones right way. And to say about children problems, I want to tell that parents should more carefully look after their children. To walk with them  with no gadgets, to take them off sometimes, to teach their child live in this world. 

To sum up, I want to say that health problems connected with modern technologies are really widespread. People make troubles to their health by themselves. But, I believe that if every person start listen to their body and look after it, there won’t be any problems in future life.

For example, we have the period of history of USA and other European's countries, when if you were born Afro-American nationality, you won't have future as whithe people.

I strongly believe that there are more disadvantages rather than advantages.
First of all, it is important to point out that big companies with multinational brands make their goods really expensive, the prices rocket but the quality stays at the same level while small componies are able to sell the things of good quality and the prices are not so high. This will help not wealthy people to have an opportunity to buy such things.
Moreover, multinational componies are not eager to come up with new ideas. They have a famous brand and the customers who are eager to buy their goods while small local shops can give the buyers a lot of new and original goods and make up something new and extraordinary. There are a lot of similar things (clothes/shoes) in big famous shops which are worn by a lot of people everywhere. Sometimes people are embarassed when they meet people in the same clothes or trainers.
However, there are some disadvantages. For example, shop assistents are really polite in multinational companies. They are always ready to hels clients, to offer tea or coffee, they can't be rude and agressive. There are underlaying causes why. The main cause is that such componies have name and they just can't afford to spoil all good comments of their customers.
All in all, it is important to point out that although there are pros, cons outnumber them. Small local businesses have to be developed and the government should tackle this problem and to take measures like introducing more taxes for big companies or some restrictions for them.",65,2,0

There is extremely popular belief that these actions sould be punished because of financial loses of creators. I partly agree with this statement. This essay illustrates different point of view on this problem.
One of the most convincing argument in favour of necessarity of punishment for making and sharing illegal pirates copies is the fact that these actions are not fair and honest. Most people are aware of that musicians and filmmakers get a huge part of profits from selling records of their songs, alboms, films – results of working hard, that are expected to be paid. Therefore, it is complicated to avoid a question: why a person, who does not pay in a store for products is a thief, but a men, who listens a new hit of a rockgroup at home for free is just a fan? It seems quite unfair in the centure of democracy.
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering about the initial role of music and art of creating films in lives of people. Factually, masters work not for money, but for transferring their feelings, emotions, ideas to hearts, minds and soules of spectaculars and listeners. Naturally, music, films and other gonres of art were allowed for everyone who wished it. It was a common pleasure independent on the size of the wallet. In today’s world this law is unlikely to be followed, and it is rather upset.
Taking everything into consideration, it can be concluded that the best way to address this issue of pirates copies is to find golden middle between punishments and common wishes to love music and films.

Sometimes students can be rude, and impolate. However, there are some reasond why do the students behave so and some ways of sollution of this question.

The first thing I want to mention is that parents should spend more time with their children and teach them how to behave in different social spheres. Nowadays, parents always on work and busy and sometimes they do not have time on their children. That is why a young person started to teach himself as he can; and the most common way to do so is Internet. Today internet provide a lot of information, which is sometimes is not suitable for a child. For instance, if child always watch some videos, films, where are rude and impolate people are a main characters he will act in the same way as they do.

Another point is that student do not see his teacher as a head, as a leader. Sometimes teachers try to be really kind and nice, but in many cases students do not appriciate such behaviour and started to be have more rude and feel more free in conversation with a teacher. I personally believe, that teacher is a very difficult profession, because he must be kind and strickt at once.

Undoubtedly, there are solutions for such problem. For example parents should try to spend more time with their children, or if this option is impossible, they should take their child to a varios sport or art activities, where he can get to know how to communicate right. Moreover, the head of a school should also somehow be involved in process. In his oportunity to employee only a professional teachers, and, if such problem exist in his school, he should try to explain to a student where he is wrong, and maybe somehow help him to become kind and polate person.

To sum up students way of behavior can be a real problem not only for school, even for the society in future. That is why his behavior should be controlled by parents or by school-employers.

From the first point of view, if there will be more pools and sport centers in towns, so people will spend more time on active way of life. Thus, the level of public health will go up. Moreover, physical exercises are the best solution for any illness. When we move, we make our organism working better, so that it will provoke improvement of all organs.
On the other hand, people believe that sport facilities will not encourage to not take pills or get off from harmful habits. Instead, the government should push the people to take sport and stop sedentary way of life. What is more, there are enough facilities for persons who want to use them. For example, for those people who like jogging there are parks and forests. The implementation of new tools will not change their preferences and they will continue to do the same, but in the different place.
In my opinion, there is no base to say that growing of sport facilities will change health rate of society a lot. As far as I am concerned it would be better to invent psychological methods to explain to people drawbacks of life without sport and with harmful patterns.

It causes a high blood pressure because of the long using of devices. This problem may be solved by less using of any electronic devices and switching screens to a night shift. The night shift is a regime which makes screen warmer. It means that colors shift to yellow instead of blue.

Unfortunately, over the past years the number of young people choosing the criminal lifestyle has increased dramatically. There are various reasons for this and many methods to prevent the wrong deeds from happening. In this essay I will discuss some of them.

First of all, it is evident that nowadays a lot of pressure is put on the youth. With globalization happening, it is exceptionally hard to stay stable and feel safe and protected. Teenagers often experience anxiety and deal with depression, which leads to some of them commiting crimes. Secondly, there are many abusive and unfortunate families, where children are brought up witnessing more evil, than good. The history of abuse motivates people to continue spreading hate, as they do not really know how to treat others with love and care.
However, it is important to remember that those problems can be solved. For example, schools can take care of youngsters coming from abusive families with the help of child counselors and psychologists. Several hotlines could be created for teenagers to call and seek help. And finally, improving the healthcare system could potentially lead to more mental disorders diagnosed and treated.
All in all, as unfortunate as it is, there will always be youngsters engaged in criminal activities. However, if one is aware and educated enough, he is always able to save someone's life by spreading positive messages and helping those in need.",65,2,3

Some people claim that usage of illegal drugs has to be punished for a fixed period of time, while others tend to think that a dishonest athlete has no right to compete without any time limints. In this essay both views will be examined carefully.
First of all, usage of illegal drugs is not a crime and sometimes is not even a choice. Some medicaments that treat certain diseases simply coincide with those that are illegal. An athlete may not have been aware of this fact. In such cases a ban from professional competing for a year or two seems to be acceptable. One should also keep in mind that this is not a serious crime and not letting to compete forever might be a too severe punishment. As long as an athlete can prove that not all of his/her achievements depend on using illegal drugs, he/she must not be punished forever.
On the other hand, dishonesty in competition provokes many controvercies. The honour of an athlete cannot be overestimated, since it takes origin from the Ancient Olympic times. This is a solid ground of a professional competition. Provided that every participant sweared to compete honestly, the everlasting ban does not seem to be an unfair punishment. It also has to be mentioned that such restrictment concerns only a professional career of a sportsmen, it does not cover amateur sphere, so the sport and even some sort of competition remains available for an athlete.
To conclude, I would like to state that while usage of illegal drugs concernes serious ethic and moral aspects, such as honour and honesty, it is crucial to remember that each case has its special conditions and punishment should go in conjunction with all of them. In spite of this there are other people who claim that dishonest competition has no excuses and has to be punished forever.

Sometimes people do not have enough time for doing some sports exercises, and they do not want to improve their health with help sports. Moreover, improving public health is force many people to do it, but they do not want do it. For example, many companies can took initiative and ask their staff to go in sport center or swimming pool and it can be caused to bad work, because people will be unmotivated their work. Also, some people can not do sport because their health do not allow them do it, but when they will know about new sports facilities sick people will be sad.
However, increasing the number of sports exercises are glad for people who like sport. Different type of sport allow them try something new. People consider that it is very good idea, because sport is health. For example, when we do to the doctor, he advise us to do some exercises in the morning, visite swimming pool and so on. Moreover, visite the sport center is good opportunity to look like a pretty person. For, example in Russia it is very popular to do sport and improve health of their nation.

It means the equal rights between both sexes in university. But should universities force this fact by an accepting equal numbers of male and female students to study or not? In my opinion, should not and I have two arguments to prove my position.

At the first, biologically in society we have more womans than mans. A s a result, the proportion of the sexes of students is unequal. It means that if universities will accept equal numbers of males and females, many females will be not accepted to the courses, because their number is bigger. It will be an unfair situation - universities should accept students to study by their possibilities and skills, but not by their sex.

Secondly, some courses and subjects have gender specialization. In the most cases, mechanics are mans, and haicuters and cookers are womans. University cant find equal numbers of students of both sexes, whose want to get a degree in, for example, car construction. Obviously, between these students will be more males, than females. It will lead us to unfair problem too - some male students will be not accepted to this course only because there will be not avaliable places for student of this gender.

Finally, I should summarise my arguments. If universities will introduce the politic of accepting to courses equal numbers of males and females, it will lead us to unfair situations because of two facts. First, society have more womans than mans. And second, in the cause of the gender stereotypes, studens of certain sexes will avoid certain courses, for example - womans prefer to enter the cooking course more than car mechanics.

More creative artists are appearing in the community and as far as I know the only one problem in modern society is censure. 
In my opinion, it is right that, government is controling this part of the cultural world, because some of newcomers in art are trying to use inappropriate content for their work such as enormous nudity, unmannered words and phrases or even scenes of violence. I suppose tgat there must be some age sectors for artists like children picture artist, 12+ age artist, 18+ age artist and so on. However, there must remain forbidden themes or genres: for example a child pornography or an over-caution violence. 
Although, in our technical era art isn't existing like it was century and further ago, today a lot of artists are trying to create art on their own personal computers or laptops using wide variety of drawing tablets or even simple mouses. And of course government can't restrict everyone, because of internet and its laws. In internet yoiu are able to do whatever you want without a risk of being caught or even a risk of being recognised. In this case it is impossible to trace every art work appearing in network. 
In conclusion I would like to say that in 21st century art become more aviable for artists as well as for everyone else, who would enjoy arts. And for every talented artist there's two ways: to work according to rules and censure restrictions and if your art is good enough you have chance to become famous or yoiu can go another way and become an anonymous artist and never reach success.

As it can be seen from the graph, Facebook is the most widely used social network among online adults of all ages, with the numbers varying from the highest of 87 percent of young adults and 56 percent of seniors using it. However, it is obvious that the network is mostly used by the younger generation. The same trend can be noticed with Instagram, which is most frequently used by the youngest age group. Instagram is most rarely used by the people of age, with only 6 percent of people over 65 years old having an Instagram account.

LinkedIn, on the other hand, is most popular among people from 30 to 64 years old. The number of users of the youngest and the oldest age groups are equal - 22 percent. This can be explained by the different needs of each generation, with LinkedIn being more of a business social network, unlike Facebook or Instagram, which are used mostly for socializing and entertainment.

Some people believe, that cheating athlets should be prohibited from competing for the rest of their lives’, orthers suppose that this period should be limited. This essay will discuss both points of view.
First point to be consider is that sportsmen, who are banned from competing for their whole life will hardly find another place in society. Sport is not just a profession or a hobby for athletes, it is the key point of their lives. It can be argued, that using drugs, a sportsman shows his desire for a good result rather than admiration for sport and such behavior should be punished. Any balanced view must take into account this alternative argument.
Looking at this issue from another point of view, a limited break in sport career will not necesseraly mean, that an athlet will stop using illegal drugs. Moreover, such a break will most likely make him or her to do so, in order to reach a high results again.
The last but not least is that unfortunately, these tests are not always accurate. Sometimes mistakes are possible. Furthermore, sport is not free from politics and sometimes the results of drug-tests are influenced by goverments. It is my strong believe, that to break somebody's life because of political issues is too cruel. To my mind, it'is a strong argument for a limited period.
In balance, I should say that there are strong arguments for both points of view. Nevetheless, it seems to me that arguments for a limited period outweight arguments against it. To prevent people from the sense of their life because of politics is rather cruel.

There are some reasons for such preferance. 	The first idea that I would like to discuss is the fact that in many countries film production is not very developed. The United States and Endland are definitely not such countries. And people living in countries without the developed film industries simply do not have an option to wath films produced locally and they obviously watch American, British (and so on) films. 	This problem can be solved if governments of such countries support local film industries financially. I think this is a very good idea because producing a film requires a considerable amount of money and young film directors may simply unable to produce a film without some financial support from the government. 	Moreover, in some countries particular genres of films are simply not popular while these genres are popular in the USA or the GB. For example, film industries in Russia very rarely produce science-fiction films and never produce science-fiction TV series. Thus, science-fiction fans in Russia watch foreign films. This is another reason for people not to watch locally produced fims. 	The second reason is very actual to me because I like science-fiction and I watch foreign films and TV series. 	To sum up, I would like to say that see no problem if a person prefers to watch American or British films. There are some reasons for this.

But there is an evidence that young people commit crimes more often than ever before. Why? In this essay I will try to explain my point of view on this situation.
In my opinion, there are two main reasons of this evidence. The first is a very fast growth of population. There are so many children, becoming young adults, and there will be even more. The point is that it becomes hard - to develop new institutions that can organize new generation, because we have to do it too fast. Even though schools and univercities try to take this function, this is not enough.
And the second reason of this situation is a high level of freedom, I think. I don't want to say that this is our world's disadvantage, let's take it as a fact - today humans have more rights and possibilities to do what they want than before. So, this can explain why young people have a feeling that they can commit some crimes without being punished.
Of course, these causes are not the only. Parents and teachers can influence children to prevent crime future. They should talk about morality principles, about the peaceful world everyone wants to live in. They should control what kind of literature, movies and social networks the child likes, because violence and crimes in the book and stimulate a young man to do the same.
So, I think, the high crime rate among young people is the consequence of little organization, no-control over the children, and high level of freedom, making them believe that they can do whatever they want without any punishment. But, in my point of view, this problem can be solved by right policies and influence from older generation.

Between 1960 and 1990 the graph went up in intensive way with a pick in 1980. From 1990 and 2010 this age group illustrate a great increase, but after that we see a fall to 18 percent.

The aim of this essay is to discuss two points of view.
Some people think that it is necessary to increase the quantity of sports facilities. Only that can really improve public health. It seems for me not a good decision. In Moscow there are many sport centers but it does not reflect on public health. There are some reasons for that. The first reason is money. It’s rather expensive to go to the sport facility, about twenty thousands rubles per year. The second reason is time. It takes more than hour to go to gym. Therefore, if the government decides to improve public health by increasing the number of sports facilities, it will be right to make a free access for them and place sports facilities near transport stations and bus stops.
Other people insist that other measures are required. First of all, the public health depends on right food. Government can ban GMO products and provide the consumption of local goods. The second measure is social advertisement. Mass media can be used to promote healthy way of life. Also government can set the higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, all these measures will not work without personal willing of being healthy. Some people dislike sport and prefer to drink and smoke instead of running.
In conclusion, it is needed to underline that public health depends on many reasons and there cannot be only one best way to improve it.

Some people believe that those athletes whose blame was proved must not have the opportunity to go on their sport career. Others, however, are sure that a chance should be always done to anybody and in any case, especially regarding entertamment sphere, which they refer sport to. In this essay both points of view will be discussed and my own presented.
On the one hand, using illegal drugs is a serious crime. People who tend to punish sportsmen for the rest of their lives point out to this fact and label accused athletes as ""crimers"" with a ""psychology of a crimer"". This means that such sportsmen will in any case try to repeat this illegal experience and, what is more, in a more complicated way, taking previous ""mistakes"" into account. To my mind, such a generalization has little grounds as all people are different.
On the other hand, people must always have a chance as any crimer has, others claim. There are different examples of change in peoples' mentalities after such precedents. One can remember Russian famous biathlonist D. Yaroshenko, who was caught eating prohibited substences with his food. As he admitted, he was too young and very ambitious that time. However, after being banned from competing for 2 years, he was able to return in professional sport and has not repeated the mistake.
I full-heartedly support the idea that athletes should not be punished forever, as there is one more serious argument for such a stance. Sometimes, sportsmen even do not know about the drugs they consume as their coaches add them into the food an athlete eats. There also can be some technical mistakes during the blood analysis performed.
To conclude, I would like to stress that although those sportsmen who let themselves use illegal drugs are breaking the law and must be punished for this, there is no sense in full-life banning them from sport as they can realise their mistakes and continue their carrier in an hones way and there are also different factors described in this essay which should be taken into consideration (technical mistakes, for instance)

But there is another point of view and people believe that it is not a good way to improve public health. The number of children in our centuary is rosed and their parents want to build some sports facilities on their money, because the child’s health is the most important thing for everyone in the world. If children go to the sports in their early years, they can achieve a great result on the Olimpic Games or another completion. Also, sport-gays never smoke or drink alcohol in their life and it is good way to feel better. This arguments suppose that if we have more sports facilities in our cities, our children and public health will be better. But there is an opposite view on this situation. Some people argue that public health is not depended on sports facilities only. They say that in our life we have a lot of disasters and problem with carbon dioxide, which have bad influence for out health. Some food and drinks are break out stomache. For example: fast-food; different food, which consists with E; coca-cola an e.g. The opposite view is that we can change our diet, our life and our views on problem. For example, people can go a walk more than drive a car. This sollution can improve public health and decline the number of carbon dioxide in air. To sum up, in conclusion, I would like to say that I agree with people, who think that if our cities in future will have more sports facilities than now, it will help us to improve our and public health. Of course, our society, nowadays have a lot of problems, which have bad influence for our health. But building new sports stadium only will help us in our life to feel better.

It should be clearly understood by government and the people that intellectual property must be paid for. There is no difference between making an armchair and creating article. Both of the action is work and must be paid for. Concerning laws of punishment people for coping and sharing films, my opinion is that the government should make sure that any materials in the internet are protected from stealing. Educational programmes should be held to inform people. Punishment will not be helpful if a person does not realize what his crime is.

There are lots of countries where people live in poverty and can not afford bying their entertainment and education, you would say. But people involved in the sphere of intellectual work will suffer from stealing in these unwealthy countries also. People should understand that their children may lose all the money because of illegal download. When they will realise that to soon all the work will be virtual and there is no other way to earn money unless protecting your intellectual property, then they care about original discs.

To begin with the point about discrimination male and female students in Universitet , if they should study every subject in equal numbers. Probably, some of them do not want to study some subject , for example, girls do not prefer physical culture , at the same time , boys are keen on sport more than literature. As a result, there are some problems. One more of the main argument is that studing together male and female students can help to socialized them. Besides, it can be seen from the life, that men are good at one aspects and women are the best in other questions.

To begin with, companies can save money, if they employ local workers in poor countries, it will help to reduce unnesessary costs. Moreover, in this way international companies might produce essential goods for developing coutries, which will help to increase the level of life in developing countries that are suffering from poverty.

Firstly, i would like to mention that sport is an important part of every human's life. It helps people to stay in tonus, be healthy and fit.
Speaking about the process of watching sport activities either on TV or on the stadium, i want to point out that it gets people together and makes them support each other.For example, when boys watch the footbal match in sport bar, they easily could find new friends and become one team. Watching sports is a process of connecting people of different ages and social statuses.
Moreover, watching sports is a nice way to be involved in a vast world of varios activities and news. For example, children could find something for themselves and understand what they want to do in their future. Many adults work in the sport sphere, that in the most of cases it is well-paid and at the same time entertaining.Thats why people love sport and want to take parts in all iths spheres.

Nevertheless, on the other hand,sometimes watching sports might be harmfull. People who are fans of different teams or sportsman might be the biggest enemies.
Consequently, when they watch sport events on the stadium, they can kick each other and make some hard injuries. However, it is not the reason to skip the process of enjoying sport activities, because every person should think of what and why he or she is doing somnething bad.


To conclude my essay, i would like to emhasise that watching sport is significant and higly-recommended for people of all ages. I am a big sport fan and all my family is. We are all into sports and it makes us one big and friendly team. Thats why i do believe that watching sport events is no the waste of time, because all people must be interested in this.",65,2,3

There are a great difference between the amount of people who study for career and for interest. It include about 70%. By contrast, people who are at the age from 40 to 49 have the same rate of trasons- approximetely 40%. In other words a half of these people continue graduating because of their career, another half because of their interest. Obviously, people over 49 tend to study due to their own interest.

Some people argue that part of flights for business and leisure is unnecessary, so governments should think about new laws to decrease the number of them. However, I suppose that this will harm society.

All of us are sometimes using planes as the mean of transport because it is easy, quick and comfortable way of travelling even on long distances. Air travel made our lifes easier as we don’t need to spend months or even year to get from one place to another as it was centuries ago. Also we have opportunities to visit places that were untouched before. The costs of plane ticket are rather small so almost everybody can afford it. So if governments decide to cut down the number of flights, the cost of air travel will rise up rapidly and this will cause unability of some group of people to afford it. This may be harmful for their business if they have to travel often or if their family lives in the other part of the world. Moreover, it may affect pilots as a lot of them will be fired if the number of flights and air companies don’t need so much work force.

On the other hand, the reduce of amount of the air travel may help to solve problems with air pollution and prevent future global warming as less planes will flight. However, I believe that this wouldn't make dramatic change in the problem of pollution as there are a lot of other things that harm our planet.

In conclusion I'd like to say that cutting down the amount of flights by introducing new laws may affect the air pollution but not greatly, while life of people may become uncomfortable and a lot of them will loose their job.

First of all, the growing popularity of technologies can lead to some problems with your eyes and ears, because most of us, users of these so-called devices, are spending too much time playing video-games, watching TV and listening to music on a high volume. These difficulties can be prevented at a early stage only by our self-control and some limits in time we use to play or listen to music.  
Another considerable and huge problem is caused by our lazy types of relaxing and spending free-time. It is believed that most of us prefer to use some types of machines at home, to do our house work, like washing dishes etc. Many of us also prefer to have a rest instead of doing some exercises, because in our modern world we have machines that can turn you ""in shape"" in a few weeks of using them. For this case you can educate yourself about some health problems, like heart-diceases, overweight, or any other types of difficuties you might face if you will spend all of your free time on just relaxing, eating, and sleeping, while your vacuum cleaner does all of your work.

In this essay I will look at both sides of arguments and give own opinion. First of all, Facebook and Vkontakte make the way of communication much easier. These websites allow transferring important information and knowledge to other people at only time. For example, your friend couldn’t turn up for seminar because of illness but he/she need to learn important aspects of this seminar, so you can take photos of your notes and put photos on Vkontakte and send them to your friends. But some people believe that it is much better to explain some knowledge or secret information by face-to-face communication because your profile is not protected carefully. Moreover, most of people prefer to be explained new knowledge in real life rather than online explanations. Despite this, there is also point of view that young people use Vkontakte and Facebook only to entertain and to be in touch with their friend constantly. People believe that young people spent a lot of time on sitting in the Internet, which distracts them for studying and occasionally it leads to the fact that people have difficulties face-to-face communication. For instance, when two friends try to revise for exam together through the Vkontakte, they more communicate and entertain rather than prepare. On the other hand, people claim that communication is important part of socializing so people can use different ways to do it and Vkontakte and Facebook are now the most important measures of communication. Thus, social media really play important role in our lives. In my opinion, such social networking sites as important information when it’s necessary but communicate with other people at any time and entertain, but we need manage our time effectively and do not waste a lot of time in the Internet.

So, opinions divide.
On one hand, those who make the music and films have to earn for their work. The idea of “poor artist” is already ancient today, as more and more people are becoming successful being musicians, actors, directors, painters and so on. Those are jobs which they chose and which are demanded in the society. We know some extremely rich artists, but how much of artists in the whole world are trying to make the ends meet? Probably, one of the reasons is leaks of their products, so that they are becoming free. For instance, we always know how much it would have earned if everyone who watch it paid.
On the other hand, Bono from U2 said that art should be free. Can we cell and buy masterpieces, or art is more valuable than all the money in the world as it makes us more beautiful inside? Can we make a world where art is a value more money-dependent by charging money for art? Also, more rational argument is that musicians earn more money by concerts they give and tours they got? But how can people know a new musician without knowing his songs? People will not pay for the songs of those they do not know. So, there won’t be so many people on concerts as there are now. Talking about films, they make more money in the first months after the release. After that, only those, who want it in a high definition would buy a DVD, Blue-ray or buy it on the Internet.
In conclusion, different sides of the conflict think differently. Artists want more money to earn, people want less money to spent. It is clearly seen that free copies on the Internet make less harm than they are thought to. So, probably this situation should not be radically solved.

It is claimed that in the modern world more and nore adolescents are getting involved into criminal environment. To my mind, this issue is rather controversial.

As for increasing numbers of young criminals, I would not be that exact, because I assume that statistics can be obsinetely flawed in order to meet the demands of companies who have their vested interest in this issue. Moreover, crime has been existing since the very beginning of our history and it has been closely connected to the pecularities of the century and traditions of a particular country, that is why it is not easy to comment on the rates of criminal cases. Still, it would be silly to neglect this problem. There are dozens of factors that may provoke such a problem starting with violence on the TV, psychological issues, tense conditions within the family and eding with official laws that approve carriage of weapons.

Obiusly, parents and teachers that deal with youngsters are the first to help them out. Some of them choose to err on the side of caution and leave them alone with their troubles.

Some consider that athletes who use drugs should not take part in competitions for two years, whereas others are sure that atheletes schould not be able to compete for the rest of their lives.
People who think that atheletes should be banned from competitions for a limited period (eg 2 years) are more kind. They wonder that people change and athelete would not use illegal drugs again. But many atheletes use it even at the period of disqualification and life does not teach them. However, many atheletes also understand their mistakes and after the incompete periods start new lives without using drugs.
However, there are also people who suggest that atheletes who use drugs should not be able to compete professionally for the rest of their lives. Such position is rather radical because there are many great sportsmen who were disqualificated and after it start a new great career. There are also sportsmen who use illegal drugs even without knowing that such drugs can not be used. For example, russian tennis player Maria Sharapova who now is on the period of disqualification.
As for me, I suggest that we all are humans and we all make a mistakes and for professional sportsmen disqualification from competitions for the rest of their lives is lik sitting in prison. That is why I think that every person should have a second chance and the first position is closer to me.

However, others do not believe that it is effeictive and they say that other measures are required. I agree with the second opinion.


The first thing that important to mention is that increasing the number of sport facilities really does create more opportunities to people. It is really hard to do sports if there are no sport centres and play grounds.  Despite this fact, many people just do not use the sport facilities that they have in their cities. It doesn't really matter how many sport centeres there are in a city, there are always will be only few people using the opportunity to do sports. So, creating more sort facilities would not have a big effect on public health.


I think that government can improve public health by promoting sport to kids. It is important to show them that sport not only saves their health but also makes their muscles grow. PE teachers should explain pupils how a human body works and what materials (food) it needs to work well. Also, government should start doing more sport competitions with attractive prizes. I always wanted to win a prize when I was a kid. The last, but not the least way to improve public health is to spend more money on medical centeres and create some TV commercials, which will show the people the harm of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.


In conclusion it is important to say that public health improovement is only possible if a government does a whole lot of things, such as sport propaganda, anti-drug propaganda and development of medical care.

Furthermore, technology have a many good sides of using. For example, people with disadvantages can use the Internet for education. News are open for everybody and people can connect with different people in the world.

Does it worth to concentrate on the period of prisoning or other measures should be undertaken? Some people tend to assume that the total crime rate can be fastly reduced by giving longer prison sentences. First of all, they consider that longer periods of time can make a psychological influence on crimunals. Therefore, the responsibility is higher and not everyone wants to pass his or her life in prison. Secondly, the fear of being emprisoned makes the authority the government and law, that is why people feel theis duties and responsibility for their thoughts and things they do. Thirdly, the risk of the second crime commitment declines considerably. But there is another point of view. Some people think that there should be other ways of crime reduction. To begin with, longer prison sentences are not always effective: some people do not have any fear or responsibilities. Moreover, other methods have to be included, such as makinf a new law background or making the law less restricted. Higher taxes can be one of the best ways to reduce the crime. In addition, people are influenced by media, that is why changing the media content can be an effective way to deal with crime. This is because the crime is commited always beacause of psychological problems. To sum up, we can influence on total crime rate by some methods, but the main is - to work with people's minds. Personally I believe that in the future we will deal with it. ",65,2,2

First of all, such condition makes the competitive entry fair due to the fact that boys and girls have similar chances to get the place at University.
Secondly, mixed classes hepls students to develop essential for a future life skills thanks to the fact that they can communicate with each other, boys with girls, they get used to live in this type of collective. This is definetly valuable, because at work collectives are usually mixed, so they have to be ready to became a part of such environment.
Thirdly, in the classes where the numbers of male and female students are equal the atmosphere seems to be more peaceful and relaxed. This in turn makes the learning process easier and quicker.
Moreover, this condition means that female and male applicants will compete for a place at University separately from each other. This will give opportunity for greater number of girls to enter successfully maths subjects, at the same time more boys will be able to be accepted in subjects like Literature and History.
Taking everything into consideration, I would like to restate my previous opinion and say that accepting the same numbers of men and women in every subject should be a rule for universities.

Such artists are not depends of the governments and can express their ideas free. On the other hand, artists' ideas can be strange and dangerous and can have a bad effect on the society. So such ideas have to be some control from the government.


At the same time, there are a lot of artists, which are not very famous, or maybe their are a part of culture project of the governmet, so they depends of the government and they can't speak free about their ideas. For example, I know some singers in my city, who are not very popular, so they need a help from the government, such a some commercial concerts, where a lot of people could know about them and it can help them to be more famous and popular. In this situation they can't express their own ideas which are different from the ideas of the government.


In conclusion, there are a lot of reasons why some artists couldn't express there ideas. I think, that every artist is a part of culture, so he has a right to free express their own ideas throught the words, pictures, music or films which become a part of the culture which can help people are change their point of view about life.

First of all, lets try to difine happiness. It will be hard to do, because there is a difference in the way of perception  outer world between people. More over in different cultures in different religions there can not be similar way to defining happines. For one man the “happy” time can be great time spent with family, for another “happiness” is a great amount of money or chieving words fame. But there is one thing to separate all this thing. When person  achieve then, he or she starts to feel only positive emotions. thus we can difine happiness as moment of tome when person “feels good” but, as I said, there is always self-interpretation of happiness.
The key factor in achieving happiness is not to break Kant’s maxima. I mean that you can’t use people like tools on your path to happiness, and your happiness always should stay in borders of you, and never affect on freedom and rights of other people.

It happens because of downloading files on the Internet. It is also believed that copying music and films on the Internet is theft. I absolutely disagree with this belief.

First of all, we should find reasons why do people download music or films. I reckon that the main reason is money. Not everybody has an opportunity to buy a CD disc with music and not everybody has money to go to the cinema to watch a new film. Without any doubts, CD discs and ticket to the cinema does not cost a fortune but there are many poor people who cannot spend money on entertaiment. That is why a lot of music and films are downloaded. Downloading makes music and films avaliable for everyone.

Secondly, if you download something, you save your time. You do not need to go somewhere. You just log on and every song , every film is avaliable to you. It takes about a minute to download a song and about 10 minutes to download a film. Then you can relax and enjoy yourself. People who make music or film producers should understand that their masterpieces will always be downloaded. People get addicted to download. For people there are more advantages in downloading and saving files from the Internet. If film producers or musicians do not agree with it and they are against it, they have to think will everybody spend their money, time and another resoucers on visiting the cinema or buying a disk.

To draw a conclusion I would like to add that this topic has its own pros and cons but I suppose that downloading files is not so bad idea.

Some people consider that it’s not right and it must be punished. From my point of view I can’t but agry with statements below, however, I have some reasons against them.
As we all know that musicians and film producers can have success, when their product like songs, album, film or serials became popular and desirable. Nevertheless, one of their money resource is selling it all in public. In contrast, the Internet is a new service, where people can find all they want and absolutly free. For instance, we can look for all live concert from famous rock star on youtube and download all his song free instead of buying his albums in shops. Nobody will deny that a lot of pirate copies of just released films appeared almost after the first cinema shows it. To my mind I clearly understand that these actions are horrible for the musician and film industry. Also, I know that there are a lot of fans that like to collect all the original discs from their beloved interpretors. Although, I like the one of these illegal users consider that, when we have the easier way, why do not use it? Like an average man, who earns not so huge amount of money, I just do, what is in my possibilities.
To conclude, I disagree with the action of copying and sharing music or films, however, I want not to refuse from this comfortable opsion.

But sometimes people of some country cant produce the food, because of weather, type of ground and some other factors. This countries has another products for sale, and they must buy food from another countries, it’s necessary to survive. If all countries will stop import, a lot of people may die.

Secondly, some countries can produce only food and it’s meen that they must buy another products from another countries. It’s normal, because it’s good for every country. And this is good for economic, because country need money always. In addition, it’s good for national relationships.

Thirdly, I cant see reasons don’t do that, everybody need it: the people, the goverment, the people and the goverment of another countries. People must help another humans, it is one of the basicly instinct of survive.

Generally speaking, I think countries must produce and import food as much as it possible, because it is money for this country and normal life for people from another country.

To my mind, we should stick to the temporary ban. I think that terminal banning could be used as a tool to put aside certain athletes regardless of whether they were caught on using drugs or not. Therefore, it is a threat to the core rules of fair-play.
Those in favour of the terminal ban might say that a sportsmen caught taking drugs once are bound to do it again. I cannot but agree that there is some sense in such a statement but we are living in a media world, so drug usage conflicts are always discussed and an athlete is exposed to it. It results in collapsing of his reputation and having to win the society's trust back be behaving. Moreover, it just seems to me that we must not put a stigma on anyone and try to give them another chance instead.
To sum up, I stand for a temporary ban. Though, it may seem like a half-measure, it will not be one if accompanied by more fair and open drug tests

To my mind, prison is not efficient and way to punishment of course in the majority of cases this solution have positive impact on social life because it is obviously prevent society from new crimes at least until for example murder robber or dangerous terrorist have arrested. But this way have also big disadvantages. For example prisoners who realesed from jail can have intention to avenge people who judged or arrest him. Also we have another well knows cases, where people was punished accidently due to judges mistakes. I suppose that there are alternative ways of reducing crime. Firstly it can be some actions for helping poorest and illness people. For example, law that allow to going any benefits from government. Secondly education of crimes motives can help police and psychologist prevent crime in many cases. Finally, benefits for good actions can help to choose people right way instead of crime. To sum up, I believe that not only longer prison sentences can reduce crime in world, but enhanced people relationship and increasing life level of all groups of people.

The main trend that can be observed is that the amount of money spent on various kinds of books in the USA strikingly outnumbered the money that was squandered in other countries. It can be clearly seen that that USA residents preferred to buy paper editions instead of eBooks - there was two times as much money spent on paper books than on electronic ones. Whereas, the forecast shows that just in 4 years the situation will change dramatically - paper editions will lose their popularity and have only 7,5 billion of dollars, whereas it will be a craze about Ebooks and they will outweigh paper`s by one billion of dollars.
There is also one more trend that can be distinguished - in comaprison to the USA, UK residents spent less money on any kinds of books. To be more precise, it was spent about 2.6 and 1.8 billion of dollars on printed books and eBooks respectively. Moreover, in the future these numbers will remain quite stable. In detail, the amount of money squandered on these two types of books will be nearly equally represented - 2 billions of dollars versus 2.3 billions.

This essay agrees that illegal copying or sharing should be banned. Developed Internet services allow people get almost everything they want and in most cases they can easily find this without making any payments. Every year there are thousands of incidents of illegal music sharing that has a negative impact on musicians salary. For instance, when some people refuse buying the original songs or albums, song writers and singers lose their stimules to create new music because they expect mostly illegal downloading instead of legal purchasing. To prevent this, many contries have announced restrictments and punishment for pirates, and it varies from simple blocking of pirate resources to such punishment as to be arrested. As the biggest part of music-makers or producers suggest, pirate copies and people who share illegal products should be panished in the same way as thieves. Firstly, all the things made originally by musicians or film-producers, are their intellectual ownership. And if pirates allow themselves copying it, it means that they understand all the consequances of their decisions. However, many people nowadays, especially in developing world, cannot afford to buy special misic account or to pay for movie tickets, so they use illegal ways of getting songs or movies, but it leads to losing money for original owners and so new albums and films will not be created anymore, so even such people should be punished or at least restricted from using illegal sites on the Internen. Secondly, there is a big problem of copying, especially new films. Often pirates buy only one ticket and record a movie and then share it on their sites, and so other people may not pay for watching it. To solve this problem, for example, in Russia their is the Anti-Pirates law that implies harsh punishemts, allowing put pirates in prisons. In conclusion, there is a real loss in revenues of misical labels and film production companies due to actions of illegal copying, so I personally think that people who use this kind of getting products should be panished and this panishment is lekely to be strict enough to prevent pirates from what they do.

Howether, it is going to be near 37% in 2050 when the people of 15 to 59 years old will be the majority. For example, the biggest slice of pie chart of Italian populations in 2000 goes to these adults. Unfortunately, this pie chart below shows the decrease of 0-14 years old inhabitants of Italy (from 14,3% in 2000 to 11,5%). This poor tendence also connected with the increasing amount of elderly people (from 24,1% in 2000 to 42,3$ in 2050).

Moreover, the part of elderly people in Yemen now and in the 2050 is supposed to be much less than in Italy (4% in Yemen via 30% in Italy on avarage).

Every year new rules, that are connected with art, appear and become more strict. As you can see, a lot of websites that showed film for free or allowed music to download are blocked or deleted.
In my opinion, it is illegal to spread copies of films and music for free, because it was someone’s work, that must be payed for. For example, if speaking about music – people want to listen what they love, so that singers make a records for sell. If you want it, you can go and buy, but, sure, there are people, who think that it is not worth it, because of this they make copies and spread it. I do not think, that people who download these files should be punished, only ‘pirates’ deserve to be punished.
First of all, some discs are rare or just left from the magazine, even cannot be sold in some regions, but demand still exists or some disks can be bought only on the consert that is far away from your home. If people cannot find legal way to get disk, ‘theaves’ allow them to download it from the internet – easiest way to get what you want. Yes, ‘buyers’ do not pay for it and musicians and film producers lose huge amount of money, but in this case, people do not have another choice.
Secondly, some versions of music of films do not exist for every technic firm. Sure, Apple and iTunes allow their users to do everything by rules – just click and buy, but some others  do not. For example, you have Sony player, and you cannot legally buy music, only download from free sites is available.
No questions, that people, who copy products of art should be punished or blocked, but, moreover, if you look at this situation from another side; producer should think about every customer, not only rich one.

To begin with, I would like to say that acception of equal  numbers of girls and boys shows that everyone has the same rights, and noone can stop you from studying where you want, because all the people have equal rights. Moreover, mixing the groups of male and female students creates a friendly atmosphere, which makes the process of studying easier for both. For example, in the faculty of philology there are too many girls and almost no boys, which leads to many conflicts and the decreasing of knowledges. In addition, in mixed groups people can see different points of view, that fact will help in future. Finally, it has to be mentioned that women can do everything as well as men, for example many scientists are women, even though in the beginning of the 20th century the proffesion of scientist was considered as a job for men.
On the other hand, speaking about the opposite opinion, that claimes that the equal numbers of male and female students is unnessasary, because of some physicall reasons. Firstly, women can not do the job, that requires a lot of power, that is why thry do not need to go to some faculties, so there will be only men. Moreover, the facilities of men’s brain allow to understand some point easier, that is why there are no problems with understanding special materials, while girls have a lot of problems with it, so it is easier to get knowledge when everyone understands the materials equally. Thirdly, women can easily adopt to special jobs as nurse or teacher because of their basic instincts – they are created to be mothers, so they can easily deal with children in most cases, while the work of the teacher for men will be much more complicated.
In conclusion, I would like to say, whether to chose the faculty with equal members of male and female or to study separately is a matter of personal choise and referens. Personally I believe that it is better to study in mixed groups where the number of girls and boys is equal, because it provides better atmosphere and makes the understanding of the knowledge better.

On the one hand, the elemination of drugged athletes is a honest way of punishment. The question is how strong should be this punishment. As for those who think about the banning from competing professionally for the rest of live, I think, it must be a worth reason for this. That is why I suppose that only judge can take a decision after a good work other such ease. Moreover, there are different reasons or health problems that make an athletes to do take drugs. Furthermore, nowadays the competion between athletes is so hard, because of different drugs they take. That is why they use to take drugs for being faster or stronger. In my opinion, the judge should take a decision after working other the case and the aspects that cause drugging.
On the other hand, there are athletes that are drugging during all their sport career, and they are doing this intentionally for getting the best score. Besides they get all best prizes, they are not the best and cannot be without taking a drug. Taking different legal medicaments is a normal thing for athletes because they should be always in form. Where is this last point, which can make the athletes stop?

The reasons of increased attention to this topic is the jump of the frequency of law breaks among youngers. What is the cause of such unusual growing of criminal activity? And what steps should society take to prevent futher increasing of crime commiting children and teens? As for my opinion, the main reason to law disobediance is lack of support from other parts of society. That is why parents and teachers should be ones to fix this situation by giving more attention to youngers they look after.
The social pressure, stress, depression, troubles with friends, first love and lack of time are the main problems youngest generation faces very frequently and knows too good. Teens hormonal changes and mental distability prevents them from solving these problems successfully all alone. That is why they tend to solve situations in a very radical and dramatical way, which often leads to commiting a crime. On the other hand, almost all young people have or should have special grown ups to look after them and help to become a good part of society. Lack of this help leads to the stated problem of growing criminality among youngs.
Thus, parents and teachers as people closest to young generation should take the situation under control. The most obvious idea to do it is to give more attention to children to children and teenagers. Indeed, it is known, that it is common situation, that parents are too busy earning money to get into all details of their child life As for teachers, they often have too much people in class to give proper attention to each individual. But from the other side it is possible for both parents and teachers to cooperate and notice worrying tendentions together. For example, teacher is able to feel changes in whole behavior pattern of his students and give know parents in case something wrong, and then they would take a closer look on changes in their child behaviour.
All in all, it is clear that rising crime committment rate among youngsters is a fact society cannot close eyes on. That is why both parents and teachers should give much attention to younger generation in order to prevent this situation to continue by giving younger people support they need.

Facebook and Instagram are more used by people whose age is 18-29, while LinledIn is not very popular among people of this age category. Talking about a little bit older users (30-49), for instance, they prefer to use LinkedIn rather then Instagram and FaceBook, because they are in a first position of all the user's category in LinkedIn. Furthermore, all the sites has in comon is the fact that people by the age 65+ illustrate the minor part of users in each social network. While the age category of people who is 50-64 years old is on the third place on such sites as Instagram and Facebook, but, talking about LinkedIn, this part of users do place on the second layer.

A lot of sportsmen are using illegal and banned medicines to upgrade their results. Somebody thinks that such ""crimes"" should cause only temporal disqualification however another people are sure that use of dopping should be punished more radical, they insist on necessity of permanent banning. In this essay i'll try to summ up both of these positions and I'll also will give my point of view on this situation.
Persons who think that athletes caught using dopping should be banned only temporary, for a short limited period insist on two important facts. First: everybody has a right to mistake; of course such ""mistakes"" should be punished but not for the hole life. Punishment here plays a role of jail were a criminal must think about his mistakes and try to change himself. Second important reason is connected with changings in ban-list of drugs and medicines. Some items could be legal for years but than they become illegal and vica versa some medicines can be deleted from this ban-list. That can cause a lot of problems and misunderstandings. For example last year a lot of russian sportsmen were banned from international competitions because of drug called melldonium, but it is necessary to understand that this medicine was legal for years.
Second point of view is connected with such things as sportsmen's honor and duty. Apologets of these ideas are sure that each sportswoman or sportsman must obey special honor laws not just rules of competitons. For example sportsman mustn't lie or try to break the rules he must behave as a honor man.
In my opinion first point of view is much better than second, because in modern world it is more useful to be very pragmatic and not to try playing in such game as duty or sportsman's honor.

The declining of big amount of air travel will tend to financial problems of those companies which can become a case of global economical problems.

Firstly, I would like to point, that such problems, that are mentioned in the previous paragraph, are connected not only with the advances in science, but with the way of people's lives, that is affected by these changes. For instance, the widespread acess to the Internet and Videogames tend some individuals to become lazy and passive which leads to the heart diseases and problems with spine.
Secondly, mentioned achievments in sciences and development of the IT causes another kind of problem, connected mostly with the psychological changes in people's lives. For example, those who spend a great deal of time in the Web, may find themselves annoyed with loneliness and distracted from the real world.
However, there are some ways to the solution of these problems. If we are speaking about the negative effect on physical fitness of the people, I should say that children, who are mostly affected by these changes, could be restricted in the acess of such ways of entertainment by their parents. Then, speaking about the psychological changes, it's up to people's surroundings to engage such individuals in offline activities and distract them from depression, caused by loneliness. Moreover, this must followed by some govern mental efforts in order to involve people in some healthy activities.

Everybody knows that copying and sharing such art products is a crime. Should people who break the law in such way be punished? In my opinion there is no right answer on this question. I can’t be only agree or disagree with it.

On the one hand we have producers, whose payment addicts from number of people, who buy their work. For example, some producer has a film. If every person would watch the film in an illegal way, for example, download in from torrent sites, the producer will have no money, Secondly, when people copying and download films in Internet, they break author’s rights. In this case people should be punished.

On the other hand, we have people, who don’t have enough money to pay for films. Imagine that there is some man, who loves cinema art with all his heart.

Others belive, such kind of atheletes should not be allowed to do professional sport for the rest of their lives. In my opinion, these athelets ought to be out of competitions during a limited period of time and after reabilitation can participate Olimpiads. Thus, the views, surrounding this issue, will be discussed.
According some specialists, atheletes who caught on doping should not compete durint 2 years which is not so strict desicion for them because this not such prolong period of time will assist them to improve their physical and emotional state. If they get rid of drugs, contenting in their blood, the atheletes can carry on their professional activities without the harm to their health and phsycho. Besides, 2 years period is a kind justified punishment which make athelets to correct such mistake as using drugs.
However, some representatives of our generation suppose, addicted sportsmen will continue using drugs, that is why they should be prevented from taking part into various competitions. Despite the fact that, many atheletes get special treatement in different sports organizations and recover from this addicton, there is a possibility, that they will face the same problem in the future and could not overcome this obstacle because their organisms are really used to consumption of chemical substances. Thus, to prevent them from negative consequances of their career, they do not have to compete at all.
Personally, I partly agree with first opinion. Athletes, addicted to drugs must pass through recovery course during some period of time to become more heath and emotionally stable. The one thing which I disagree is the 2 year period because every athlete feels different and should be prohibited to compete depending on his state.
To summarise, some people prefer to ban athlete's activities because of doping during 2 years. In contrast to them, others feel strongly such sportsmen must not participate at all. To my mind, only the specialist should determine the the period athlete ought not join in sports events, paying careful attentions on his or her health criteria.

If you want my opinion - I totally disagree with such point of view.
Firstly, the reducing of number of flights will make life of people more difficult and inconvenient. People travel by plane everyday and their aims to do it quite various: It is clear that there are a lot of travels just to get rest or just for fun, however there can be very significant and important events, which men shouldn’t miss. For example, it can be connected with family, health or work. In any way, the decision to reduce airflights will distinct the personal life of humans.
Secondly, travelling by plane are often used by businessmen, who need to solve their problems rapidly. If government restrict the amount of air travelling, businessmen will lose a lot of money, because of the unability to meet with their partners and other important people. In this way, such decision of governments will badly effect on the business life.
Finally, I think that the negative influence of airplanes on the environment is not the problem of people, who use this way of traveling. To my mind it is the problem of inventors and constructors of these planes, because they should pay more attention to the systems, which should totally decrease the bad influense of this kind of transport. So, government need to ask them to improve the planes in order to not to restrict the number of flights.
To sum up, I don’t agree with the reducing of number of air travels, because the main reason of pollution is not the amount of travelling, but the construction of the air transport. In addition, the life of people will become more uncomfortable and difficult if the government takes this decision.

Government can reduce air pollution by reducing the amount of air travel. However, I can partly agree with this point of view and think that there are both disadvantages and benefits of such government politics. First of all, different restriction can reduce the amount of business and leisure travel. As a result, people can get cleaner air, less noise, which is harmful for human’s health. Consequently, such measures can decrease level of air pollution, global warming and improve such business as higher taxing for the government and increasing level of health. However, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can lead to the significant increase in the using of cars, trains and other transport which can be as harmful for the environment and air as the air transport. As a result, such measures can even worse the global environment. To conclude, there are some concerns about reducing the amount of  unnecessary air travel, because it lead to the increasing air pollution in  long-run. That is why I can only partly with such measures as government interventions.

Independense will grow countries economicy, because money wasted by population for food doesn’t “floight away” from country and with that indepensity import will grow.

A great number of people from all over the world dream of having a good, high education in order to get a well paid job. In this case, many people claim that there should be an equal number of students of each sex, both male and female, in Universities in every subject. Personally, I am in two minds about this issue.
On the one hand, without any doubt, it is a good idea for a plenty of reasons. First of all, it will be a perfect boost for developing tolerance in our society. Because, there wouldn’t be jobs only for women and for men. And, so, it will destroy conflicts based on gender. Moreover, it will help our society to develop a lot of male areas, were women can be really usefull. In addition, such a measure can become a great socialisation tool. I firmly believe, that, for instance, on technical faculties, where the majority of students are men, equal number of female can make the study more interesting and productive.
On the other hand, I am totally concerned, that such a situation is impossible. To begin with, I’d like to tell, that male and female has different type of mind. Maybe, that’s why many boys tend to prefer technical subjects and science, while girls preder working with peopleand some not scientific subjests, such as history or sociology. Also, it is not fair at all. Why should we deny some boys or girls in order to make the situation in the university genderly equal? The competition should, and only strongest ones should be able to study in the university, and it isn’t metter is it a man or woman.
All in all, I must confess, that it is a quite complicated topic. But, I also think, that this idea is really unfair. In the tryings to destroy the gender boards, to make everybody equal, to make our society absolutely tolerant, people no longer fallow the human sence. In my firm belief, we must stop it before it is too late.

While a decline in the number of boys in rest of the world is slight, the drop in such index in other regions is so sharp. However, it may be noticed that the number of girls without access to education has plummeted too. A sharp fall can be seen in South Asia, while in other region the percentage has declined by approximately 4,2 %. Moving to the second part of data, there is no doubt that the number of children decreased during 12 years. For example, the percentage of children with no access to primary education in South Asia has declined dramatically by 22,8%. Meanwhile there is no any sharp decrease in other regions. Taking these things into account, it may be concluded that there is an overall drop in the number of boys and girls who do not have access to primary school education during years in three regions and two gender groups.

First, helping to poor countries influence the world’s quality of life in general. Standard of living reduces because of different illnesses in poor countries which don’t have enough medicine to treat them, so international companies should develop some ways of transferring medicine to developing countries. This may help to reduce the world’s death tendency. For example, brigning some medicine to Africa will decrease the children death. Furthermore, improving the situation in developing countries might help developed countries to use and find more natural resources in poor countries. For example, companies can build more school for children in Africa and because of better educational skills poor countries will help to use their resources to developed countries.

Some people consider that air travel influences environment negatively therefore it is essential o reduce its amount. This is really controversial question but I somewhat disagree with this statement because of some certain reasons.
 To begin with, it is a common kwowledge that traveling by plans is one of the most sage transport.
According to statistics, car accidents occure more frequently than in the air. To continue with, it is ridiculous to ban business trips by planes because problems must be solved fastly and plane is the most quick machine in comparison with others therefore busy people really appresiate this kind of transport. Also, a lot of relaxing destinations are situated far from business centres and it is more convenient to achive them by planes.
 On the other hand, air travel can be damage for nature because planes exhaust poison gases which pollute the atmosphere and cause the global warming. The situation is escalated in degree and intensity all over the world and reducing the amount of air travel is one of the measured which could be done. Furthermore, it is the most expensive kind of going trips and it is not easy to control air traffic therefore accidentsv and disasters happens ans no one has a chance to save themselves.
 All in all, I partly disagree with the opinions that it is necessary to reduce amount of air travel for business and leisure because it is not efficient to decline using of this transport because of its numerous advantages, for instance, comfort, less time-spending and safety.

In one hand, humanity meets a big ecological problem which of course will have an influence on our life in the nearest future. Will people solve this problem before it will be too late or not depend on our behavior right now. So the thoughts about reducing the amount of air travel is kind of logical. But in the other hand it might be not the best solution for concept  many solution. The mobility of modern society became a really important part of our live. And it can be a little bit silly to try to stop this global movement. Maybe we should try to find out other solutions to avoid air pollutions and global warming.

This essay, firstly, will discuss negative consequences of modern technology that affect human's health, and, secondly, outlines some measures to be taken to solve these problems.
One of the biggest problem is that due to the development such phenominen as Internet, people become much lazier, which lead to the problems with weight. They are spending their holidays in front of the computer, playing games, watching films or something else, instead of doing sport for example. Another health problem, which is important, is mental deseases. A lot of people suffer from differend psychical illnesess, because of harmful influence by social net works, that has been developed due to the modern technologies. They often feel agressive and other strong emotions which cause depressions and even self-murdering. The using of mobile phones makes people nervous.
The probable solution of the first problem is the promotion of sport and active lifestyle through the Internet. Moreover, a good idea is to organize a range variety of festivals on different themes to make people more motion. The second problem can be tackled by establishing specialized centres for supporting and helping people, who are obsessed with social net working. Aslo, parents should prevent their children from using mobile phones and other gadjets, in this way kids will be more mental-stable and not spoil their eyes.
Take everything into consideration, despite positive results of usage of modern technology there are harmful consequences on people's health and body. To reduce this negative influence some measures need to be taken, the rest of them may be provided by implementing the modern technologies.

There are two opposite points of view whether it is bad or good. I’ll try to observe both advances to the problem and state, which of them is right or wrong in their ideas.
On the one hand, it is claimed to be a working and healthy system, which will improve everybody’s life. Firstly, it is a form of insurance for every citizen in case of emergency, when he will lose his main income due to some illness or something else. Secondly, it helps to rearrange economical goods so as to help someone in need by taking small part of goods from the rich ones using taxes. Finally, such a system may help people to establish some business even without taking a loan from some bank.
On the other hand, there are not only pros but also cons in such system. For instance, this way leads society to degradation as there are fewer reasons to work if you get money for nothing. Moreover, these “Guaranteed Income” is based on government where taxes are high, which means business sphere feels itself worse and whole economic growth of the country is crippled.

However, there are people who believe that we should decrease the number of flights in order to protect the enviroment. To my mind, many other ways to solve problem of polluting air might be found.
To begin with, air pollution is result of a flawful technology that could be improved. There was a breakthrough in the evolution of technologies recently that continues to expedite every day. Moreover, more and more companies including those that are responsible for air transfer start following the ""green trend"" which means that they try to adjust their products to new high ecological standarts. For example, they develop new models that need less fuel. Therefore, they attempt to present eco-friendly airplanes that might prevent enviroment from being polluted.
In addition, if the amount of travelling by air was reduced, people would likely use other means of transport more. The following increase in the usage of cars, trains and ship will escalate the situation with global pollution, because they are far from being immaculate in terms of ecology too. As a result, the reduce of flights seems to alternate one problem with another which makes a given proposal not ideal.
On the other hand, the discussed suggestion might give positive results if air companies decrease the number of flights by opening more direct destinations. For example, less dangerous fuel would be needed if it was possible to fly directly from Moscow to any New Zealand city without a transfer in South Korea.
To sum up, the problem of air pollution has a plenty of soultions and aspects that should be taken into account. The improvement in technology and logistics seems to be the best ways to provide people with quick and eco-friendly means of transport including airplanes.",70,2,1

As for me, i absolutely agree with this opinion. Indeed, sport has so many advantages. Firstly, it can help us to avoid such deseases, from which suffer fat people. 
Moreover, according to statistics, it makes our life longer: people, who are not interested in sport die before than people, who are. What is more, there is no doubts, that some exercises are possible to improve our mood, especially when we do it with music.
However, there are some people, who are do not agree with me. They consider other measures to improve public health would be better than sports facilities. They are even sure, that sport is dangerous for people: they say about different heart diseases and some injures when you do exercises. What else, they suggest such ways of imroving public health as different diets (vegetarians support it), various of hobbies (it has good influence on our physocology, etc) 
I do not agree with such people, because I suppose, sport is the essential part of our everyday life. Opponents of my point of view are lazy and unfortunate people. They create different reasons. Diet is good, but it has so little effect, to my mind... Sport makes us free from harmful habits.

Some people think that there should be a law which punishes the illegal copying of music and films.
I partly agree with this point of view. On the one hand, musicians and film makers spend a lot of time and money on producing something interesting and unusual for the auditory. Creators as all other workers should have some salary for their work. It can be gathered by buying music en CDs and films to the cenema centres. But because of the power of Internet and programmers who can find such songs and films the musicians and film produces loose the ability to get some money for their work and sleepness nights in office. It means that programmers and people who download files are in the side of criminal and they should be punished for that.
On the other hand, there a lot of people who can not allow themselves to buy legal music and films because of their high price. Sources with intertainment content require huge payment per month. In Apple music, iTunes, Google music almost all music is too expensive that people decide not to buy it but, maybe, buy goods for family instead of new song. What is more, tickets in the cenemas also is too expensive for ordinary people. Maybe because of these facts people choose not to buy original copy but to download for free.
I personally think that copying and sharing is a theft but not so awful like killing people Music and film produces should adjust a price (make it lower) for products of this industry in order to solve this problem of illegal copying.

This point raise a question if advantanges cost them.  First of all, this process allows a lot of unemployed people, and in India and China, as I know, a huge protion of them, to have a job and to earn a money for themselves and theirs famillies. Secondly, moving of a business in developing countries may decrease a price of a product which gives a chance to increase the number of consumers because more people would afford it.  On the other hand, the salary in that kind of fabrics extremely low and employers often do not have any medical insurance  or garantee. Moreover, it is widely known that companies use children as the free-labour which is illegal. Another disadvantage of this trend is that replacing all fabrics and factories in Asia and different poor countries companies spoil them. Air and water pollution are considerably higher in this type of countries then in developed, such as the USA or the Russian Federation. Companies also ruins the ciltural heritage of countries and their nature and wildlife. Last disadvantage of that development is elliminating small companies out of the race and competition because they their production is smaller and they have not got the possibility to reduce the price of theirs products.   To sum up, I believe that all advantages can not outweigh the disadvantages when it conserns the humanity and the condition of the Earth.

Metals delivered by rail and by road account for 35 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Otherwise, there is a contrary trend for the transportation of food products, where the percentage of transportation by road is larger than for the second one in 3 times.
Moreover, there is some sharp difference between machinery goods transportation by rail and by road, which make up just 2 per cent for another one. The amount of the transportation of manufactured goods, chemicals and non-metallic minerals is almost identical for two examples.

To my mind, that statenment is partly true. I see it as a result of lack of morality in our everyday life. Due to the fact that teens do not see a good example of behavour, they start to act as ""cool"" and ""bad guys"" from movies. Thus, they pretend to be worse than they actually are. The second reason may be the social status of their family. It is not a surprise that a poor person may steal someone`s wallet to buy some food for himself or for his familly. These circumstances shall also be taken into account. The third reason is concerned the parents of such deviant teenagers. I belive that they do not pay enough ofattention to what their children do in their spare time and to what they are keen on. Sometimes teens just want more attention to themselves and do everything not to be ignored.

To solve the problem of teenagers` criminality parents and teachers have to work together. I may give some pieces of advice to them. Firstly, parents shall control what their children watch in the Internet or on the TV to reduce the bad influence. Moreover, teachers may show good films such as ""One flight over the cockoo`s nest"" in school to educate the teens. Beside, parents shall give a good example of how to behave to their children. You can not blame your children for being rude if you are also rude. Sometimes young people need more love from their parents and it can be helped just by being nice to them. Finally, teachers shall help teenagers becoming better and not just punish them for every mistake that they make.

To sum up, the problem of teenagers`s criminality comes from different places. The teenagers are not only ones to blame. To be honest, I would like the society to assist deviant teens with socializing. I hope that one day there will be less criminals among the young people.",70,2,0

Then government had an idea to introduce new laws in order to reduce this kind of travelling for some activities.
In my opinion, I mostly agree with this point of view, which based on decreasing of the amount of air travel. First of all, the reason is pollution, which contribute to global warming. Environmentalists are convinced that air travel is really damaging to our nature. Aircraft engins emit heat, particularities and gases, which have negative influence on atmosphere and only government can protect the planet from global warming. Secondly, there are a lot of alternative transport exists and they can be less dangerous for human being. Government in this situations should introduce laws, which grab people’s attention to the another type of transport. Moreover, unnecessary air travelling, which includes short trips on airplanes for 2-4 hous, should be restricted or banned, because it is possible to use more ecological train, for example.
On the another hand, we are living in a high speed society and time makes money. In different circumstances it is impossible to travel long destinations for a long time. In addition, businessman can not waste their time on trains. In this case air travel should not be restricted.
In conclusion, air pollution must be restricted because of damaging influence on our nature and government should take care of it and introduce some measures like higher taxes or restrictions on short distanse air travel for leisure, but laws can not covered or include businessman.

Firstly, this essay will focus on the ground for such a tendency, and, secondly, it will provide several guidelines that can be used to tackle this problem.
To begin with, the main cause for criminal activity of young people is the growth of violence in the social media and sphere of entertainment, to be mor precise, cinema and videogames. Being involved into virtual reality full of cruelty and harrassment, the youth transfer this perception to the real world. If the boundaries between the virtual activity and social life become blur, an individuality does not care anymore whether his or her behaviour is acceptable according to the norms and values that are established in the society. There is a convincing evidence based on the latest research of psychologists that those people who are addicted to video games often see their own life in the same way. The whole world is just a level of a game for them. That is why they can commit robbery, steal a car or even murder a person they dislike without awarness of the consequences. The second significant reason of the growth of youth criminality is the lack or the absence of social support both of the society and of their family. It is well known that a child with deprived background has much higher probablity of becoming a criminal than his peer from caring family of the middle class. Growing up and having to survive in indifferent or even hostive world these people try to reach their goals with any means possible.
Turning to the changes that can be implemented in order to minimalise youth criminality, first and foremost, it is is essential to work on educational campaings raising awareness of how dangerous getting involved into video games is. The second point is supportins traditional norms and values. They can also provided both through educational institutions, although the upbringing in the family is more essential in that case. Not only are the relations in the family significant for shaping the mindset, but they also play a significant role in psychological outcast and comfort of a person. If there are people an individuality can rely on in any life situation, he is unlikely to turn to activities that reject social rules.
Summing up, both the school and the family are supposed to be effective tools in reducing the amount of crimes commited by the yough. They should concentrate on deeper interaction with each individuality, its mindset and life perception and have a proper influence on him.",80,2,1

The process of modernisation is easy to be seen. However, still there are serious problems with student behaviour. 

In order to understand these problems it is important to know the causes of such student behaviour. There are several reasons for that. Firstly, some schools have really strict rules that are always guided by teachers. The uniform rules that tell pupils about how they should behave themselves at classes and so on… it happens that pupils have very limited freedom. At their age it is important to give them more freedom because their main traits of character are formed, their unique abilities are developed. Such restrictions can lead to various conflicts between teachers and pupils. By the way in schools pupils of different abilities study together. This is where humiliation sometimes borns. Some pupils are better, they are loved by teachers. That is how other pupils that are not so good in the subject can feel discomfortable.

Touching upon the theme of solutions I personally support the idea of formation of classes where pupils with equal abilities can study. Some schools in Europe and Russia have recently started up such type of a programe. I think that it prooved its success. The conflicts have become a much more rare event. Moreover, I support a point of view that strict rules of behaviour at classes, rules about being late at classes are not really needed. They usually become the base of conflicts between teachers and students where both sides can be right at the same time. As an example it can be said that a pupil may be late for his morning class because the train in the metro suddenly stopped and did not go further. However, teachers have certain rules. Thus they have to put a bad mark and write a note for the pupils parents. On the other hand pupils usually attend some courses when they are at school. At courses there are usually no severe problems with student behaviour as there are no strict rules. 

In conclusion, the education system is being developed every day. Scientists search through better methods of education that can help to eliminate conflicts. I believe that problem connected with student behaviour will soon disappear.

However, several eminent scientists are considering that we are becoming too successful, that our way of life has a serious impact on ecosystem of the Earth. Air pollution and global warming are the obvious examples of this affecting. According to this, decision are divided into two main groups: some people think that air travel should be reduced by government, others believe that it is beneficial to our society. Let us discuss the pros and cons of it. It is my personal strong belief, that our travel is necessary for humanity. First of all, it is the fastest way of transport. While planning business trips or vacations, millions of people prefer to use planes, because there is a good combination of speed quality and price in modern air transport. Moreover, safety is also a great characteristic of our travelling. The possibility of air crashing is about one chance of million flying miles, whis is the smallest quantity among all modern ways of transport. At least but not at least planes are able to cover a lot of  miles, including oceans, mountains and so on. It is nearly impossible to travel from Sydney to London without using our transport. In spite of sitting in comfortable chair, you should spend a couple of weeks on ship, then using longway trains and so on. To my mind, it is not so convenient. On the other hand, some people think that it is harmful for our planet to use air travelling. However, I believe that there are a lot of more damaging for our Earth human activities. For example, the air is also polluted by cars and fabrics, the sail and water are polluted by deforestation and using pesticides in agraculture. So we should focus our attention on other important environmental issues, which is not such beneficial to our society. To sum it up, humas find a right balance in using damaging for our planet resources, but we should start from some more critical problems, then reducing the amount of air travel.

I disagree with that opinion. I think that countries should produce more foods and import it. 

Firstly, I think that import it is always advantage. Because, for the proced food, other countries pay some money to country which sells that food. Money is always benefit for contrie, due to that much money countrie has, the more improvements it can make. For instance, government can improve roads, build new houses for people or new medical centres, but for these government need money, and it can get it from import food.

Secondly, all countries have different climat and different opportunities to produce some food. For example, in Russia it would be difficult to growth bananas. So it most easier to export from other countries. However, if all countries don’t import foods, some countries stay without some food, and it is awful. People need various food, because from different food you can get more vitamins than from one type of food. Also some countries don’t located near the sed, so they would’t have fish, if all contrues import as little as possible. Some people say that fish is very useful product, and without fish some people can have ill. Also, if something happened, live big fire which destroy forest and many fields, countries which make more food than their own population eats, always have food, which it can’t import and use in difficult situation. But if countries produce not enough food, then people can dying if many fields would be destroyed. 

To sum up, I want to say that countries should produce food not only for their own people but from import. Because all countries would have different food, and it is important for citizen health. Besides, countries would get much money due to they import food.

Secondly, if someone spreads the links on these files all over the social-media pages, he or she does not only turn himself or herself into a thief, but also shows the other people that it is completely normal and acceptable.
However, there are also those who think it is not an actual theft to download media-files from the internet. Instead, the files were already there and you do not do anything wrong by just watching them from your laptop. Furthermore, people do not find any other solutions, because the prices in cinemas are too high, but they still want to broaden their minds by watching good films. Thus, if you do it with a good educational purpose – it is not a theft.
Although, there are some truth in the arguments above, I still agree with those people who believe that “downloading” equals “stealing”, because most of people do not actually know how expensive it is to create a movie or a song.
To sum up, copying and sharing media-files on the internet is bad, that is why the government should create a social programme, which will help to make music and films more affordable, so everyone would be able to enjoy these pieces of art.

One of the most popular hobbies is whatching sports.But can it beneficial of it is just a wasteof time. In this essey I would like to analise different effects of the hobby.

Firstly, we can devide people in two groups: active fans and passive ones. The second group usually does spent too much time whatching sports, they do it almost on TV and don't significantly affect the society, while the first group,usually wathcing live sport events, can be really agressive.
We can remeber many cases when the booing croud of fans ruined parts of cities and traumatized each other.So-called active fans can be called a problematic part of society.

Nevertheless, there is an opposite oppinion, which claimes that fans can be socially-friendly and, what is more important, they help sport industry development,which makes nation more healty. This point of view is, whithout ane doubt, sensible.
Still, we should take into account the fact that being sport fan doesn't mean being fit and healthy. The vast majority of fans dring alchogol and eat junk food. So, it can't be called a healthy lifestyle.

To conclude,it can be noticed that watching sports can be useful for the personal health and national development, only if you don't neglect it.",65,2,1

Almost they do this way because companies have a lot of opportunities and facilities in countries where they have not got any different companies and where there are a huge amount of free workers. So there are some advantages of moving business in developing countries. First is that there are a lot of people, who have not a job and who really want to know something more than basic knowledge. So companies could teach them how to work right. The second advantage is a free area. It includes natural resources and lonely business. Of course, big companies could use natural resources which could cost not so much as in a native country. So it is really pleasant for businessmen. And one more advantage is people, who have not got some things. For example, the company produces carpets and move business to Africa. In some areas people have no idea about carpets, so they will interested in producing and buying carpets. Moreover there are some disadvantages of moving business in poor countries. First of ll, some companies would have troubles with government of this country. It could be happen if there is a company which produce alcodrinks. So problem could be happen in Islamic countries (because of region). The second disadvantage is a big paper work which include documents for moving in poor country. It means that the process of moving could spend not a month, but one or more years. To conclude, there are more advantages than disadvantages of moving international companies’ businesses to developing countries and employing local workers. But, personally, companies should be alternative to people and traditions of the country before moving businesses.

However, when the person accustomed to living in prison for too long it is extremely hard t adopt again. Others claim that if the laws are not strict enough a person will easily makes a thick if he knows no hard punishment will be given. It is certainly true, however not only laws should help the streets be safe at night. Better level of education and infrastructure of cities should benefit the society. In my opinion, we should spend more time on education and on helping people to find work. I am totally think that if a person gets enough for sofisticating living, his is never become a buglar. In addition, in own society if you experienced enogh and well educated and a bit ambitious you should find your dream job easily. However, these is no country that can achieve that goal. That’s why I believe that government should revive an interest of knowledge at youngest age as it is possible because if a person likes studing he will study and will not be connected with crime certainly. In conclusion, we should have strict laws, however the sophisticated level of knowledge and places wher people could express themselves seemed to me more important. Society also should help more to make an exprisoner’s adoption easier. If the society could achieve these goals our countries will be safe than they are now.

In my opinion, there should be only a small level of restrictions in press, film industry, music and other informational spheres.
On one hand, it’s true that all sources of information should be transparent and face no censorship, especially the press. People have a right to know what is happening in the world without hidden facts. We all remember the conflict between Russia and Georgia wich appeared not so long ago. The informational war which began threatend to have a huge impact on russian status as peacefull country. Eventually, all the truth came out and we escaped and we escaped another World War. During that period of time everyone was looking for the facts wich would help to consider who was right.
Another source of information wich needs to be free from governmental eye is the Internet. It is a place where people can truly show who they are. They can express themselves in any way. Internet really helps people to become  those who they wanted to be and every kind of censorship may harm that atmospheree.
On the other hand, if there will be no control over some topics like porography or murdering it may cause some distructional impact on people, especially on children who are only growing in this world and trying to find themselves. Some violent computer games and movies should be banned or face restrictions in order to prevent young people from that source of distructing information.
To sum up, there should be no total restrictions and censorship in some fields of information, however, there are especially important points of “knowledge” wich should be controlled.

An the other hand, sport culture needed to promotion. A level of sport culture is an indicate of level of public health. The ad of sport may included in cinema, books or even music.

It is very controversial question, and I would like to express my point of view on the increasing of sports buildings.
First of all, people who believe in the power of sport are right in some extent. Sport can help and just to improve your skills and may be win some illness. But in my mind such people are wrong in some fact. In my point of view, we can do sports exercises not only in special sport facilities, but also at home or just run in parks, so, man`s health are often depends from himself. As was mentioned, other people suggests that sports facilities would have little effect on public health and there are should be other facts or motivations. As I think, such people right too, but not in all. Of course, other measures are necessary, for instance the healthy food, the conditions of living and so on, but I believe that sports buildings and in general, motivation to do sport will have quite significant influence on public health.
So, to sum up, I want to repeat that both views are right in some extent. In my opinion, sports facilities really can help tp improve public health and motivate people to do sports, but there are undoubtebly should exists other facts – mainly, man`s wants to be healthy.

On the one hand, it is very useful to produce the food that your population is consuming. It means the country become fully independent from the other ones. One of the important conseqence is that the economy of your country will be stable. This is important for every government. It also means that the country will not face such problems as lack of food, because the country only produces food. Fruits and vegetables from other countries can be the source of different diseases that can cause a calamity.

On the other hand, people in such country will never taste products from other countries. Part of the population may dislike the native food. So they will have to relocate in to another country. By the way, import allow to improve technologies and educational level in the country. For example, the USA imports a lot of products and devices from the other countries and it is still one of the most powerful countries in the world.

Finally, the opinion that countries only need to produce the food that their own population eats is not clearly true. It has pros and cons as well. Limiting import will make the economy stable, but it also spoils the science and education and delete the possibility to improve the economy.

But in these day and age many small businesses are disappearing in contrast with famous multinational brands. This process was inevitable but the question is still strong - whether it is good for our world or not. Down below I will discuss some advantages and disadvantages of this issue.
On the one hand, large and well-known brands are extremely useful: they mostly provide some high-quality goods being sertified with time and public judgement. They are widely spread in all developed cities and there will be no problem for us to find one of those. Inherently, people can find anything they want in large shops with self speaking name. In contrast, there are some downsides, of course. Usually those brands swell up in all directions in the economy and do not allow the others to develop. They monopolize the area and control it only by itself. Naturally, that fact can not do good for the country being developed and democratic.
On the other hand, small businesses can get us all the goods we are looking for and sometimes they are even better than those from the famous shops. People do not mention them in front of their faces or just do not want to because they do not believe in them being good enough. Sometimes completely undeservedly and that is unfair. The main benefit is that in the local shops citizens can always find some goods they would never be able to see in the big shopping centers. They are also spread throughout the towns that are located quite far away from the political and economic hearts of the country so it is convinient for all people living everywhere. Small brands have no place to develop and no fresh air to breathe and that is the main reason so many people are afraid of them being unknown.
To sum up, we naturally can do nothing to prevent the large brands from growing even bigger and to help the small shops to develop. However, the further spreading may cause a catastrophe and full monopolization which would be completely undesirable and would ruin the whole world balance.",65,2,0

In this reason companies that produce such materials do not earn as much as they can.

There are several opinions about this issue. On the one hand, today individuals consume so much goods of the musical and cinematography sphere that it will be too expensive for them to pay for every downloaded pirate copy. On the other hand, musicians and film producers spend a huge amount of money to create their products, so they need to earn this money from sales.

I agree with the statement that people who do not buy illegal copies of music records or films and download pirate files, should be punished. Despite their opinion that they are able to listen to music and watch films on the Internet for free, this is theft and they are obliged to pay for their crime. More over, a special kind of police should be created to punish such “pirates” and help companies to return money and to not allow to download something without payment.

To draw a conclusion, the pirating in the information and entertainment spheres is a serious issue of modern society. So goverment and authorities shoud do every thing to cope with this problem and make these spheres safe and legal. I believe that in the future we will download everything and pay for it. This will make our society honest and rich.

What are the main purpose people use it for? Some people believe it is an effective tool for sharing valuable information, while others argue hat social networks are primarily for entertainment. I believe that social media can serve both aims. In my essay I will give examples for these 2 point of views. Most information which we can find in such social networks as Facebook and Vkontakte are mainly about hobbys, films, music. Also lots of social events, international and local news get widely coverage there. That means one who has account in such social media can easily get aware of any latest local and world community news, which is really comfortable and easy. It is a tool for many of us to keep up with newest friends in fashion, music and in many other areas. Moreover, social networks help to connect people with each other in their professional areas. People create professional communities groups where they share specific information devoted to career success and other topics. What is more, employees nowadays use facebook to find skilled workers for their firms simply by checking potential employer’s profile. On the other hand, people believe that school media is not a reliable information source and can serve only fro entertainment. The reason for such viewpoint is that any people can write any kind of information in the Internet and indeed, this information is not necessarily correct. In addition, as a source of many entertainment services, such as online-cinemas and stream tv, free acess to music and journals, popular newspaper can seriously distract attention from work. People loose their concentration, which affects the resuit of work or study. In conclusion, the use of social networks have such benefits as gaining valuable information, but also influence people concentration and distract their attention. I believe, that we can combine.

As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. In my opinion, air travel is inevitable and because of it the government should not introduce some laws or something like that to decreas air travel. The first advantage is that our century is century of technical progress. Our lifes become quicker and most of us hasn’t got any free time. Thanks for air travel we can not only safe our time, but also it allows us to achieve to our destination in safety. To my mind, it is very important part. The second argue is that even if the government introduce some laws which increase air travel and in conclusion help to reduce air polution, this burning issue will always be in our lives. Of course, we should take into consideration that our ecological situation now is in dangerous but we also should understand that the problem will not solve, even there is no planes at all. The third argue is that anouther transports also have a great damage to our enviromental. For example, car’s gasses has a lot of bad influence especially in megapolises. In conclusion, I want to stress that every point of view is important and justified but my point of view, that government should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, seems to me the most convenient.

On the one hand, air travel is the best possible way of transporting people for long distances. As we know, time is the most important resource, air travel is probably the best invention during the history that help people to save their time. Another advantage of air travel is that air transport is the most safety on. The chanse to get into car accident is much higher than that your plane will fall down.
On the other hand, the protection of the earth seems to be more important than time, we are responsible for the planet and should remember that it is the place where our children will live.

Metals occupied here only eleven percent, proportion of minerals and chemicals were a bit larger. The most significant part was provided by food products which composed 30%. Two percent of road transportation was held by machinery.
As an overview, the largest shares of railway transportation came for metals and for food for vehicles transportation came for metals and for food for vehicles transportation. This can be explained by the distances - trains usually have longer distances and the food might rot. For road transport there are no requires to transport machinery in such big quantities.

It is not surprising but in the past children spend more time with their parents. To my mind, there are some reasons for this. Firstly, parents work a lot because they want to give the education to their children and try t provide them all important things. Secondly, in the past the situation was not the same because there were not so many opportunities for work, past generation was given definitely job and place. Moreover, now we live in the world of big consumption where it is very difficult to live if you don’t have enough money. It is worth adding that his situation cause a lot of problems which every family has to tackle in order to improve the relationships in family an live in the harmony without any misunderstanding. Moreover, the main problem is obvious, parents and children don’t communicate a lot with each other, they begin to argue because they don’t understand the situation. Also, children in such families are living alone, parents don’t support them due to the lack of time. In conclusion, I would like to say that as one of the famous saying goes, “So many men, so many minds”. But I strongly believe that both parents and their children have to solve this problem. For example, it is an excellent idea to spend a lot of time together when parent have day-off. Unfortunately, some parents avoid such chances and prefer more important things for them instead of spending time with the family.

Current problem is extremely urgent nowadays. Some people are sure that art should live in its ""pure"" way without any restrictions. While others believe that some works should be forbidden.
In same way art without any restrictions is reasonable. First and foremost, art is about expressing personal feauters, individual traits. And that would not be fair to form some frames and rules on artists works. Moreover, if we are speaking of liberalism and pluralism, that means that every person can express his feelings and emotions in different ways. And noone in this situation can say what is wrong and what is right. However, some people claim the opposite opinion. They are sure that forming restrictions on works of art is a good idea. They have several reasons for that. First of all, some works of art can propose immoral and cruel ideas, which can influence badly on people and their relations. Some people can interprete art in their own way and it can lead to terrorism and war. Futhermore, children, teenagers and adolecsents have an unformed mind when, can be easily unfluenced and effected in a wrong way. For instance, it is scientifically proved that after some films there was a high level of murders and thefts.

And while people usually bring up damage to importing country’s economy as a main reason to why they think that way, I strongly disagree with that idea for a number of reasons listed below.

First off, in order to stay healthy people need vitamins and other nutrition elements. Those elements can be found in different kinds of food from all over the world. Obviously, no country in the world can produce all of the world’s variety of food within its borders, so to compensate for that said country need to rely on import. That alone is a reason for importing food, but to expand on my point I think it should be noted that the wider choice people have, the better it is for the country’s economy.

Secondly, importing food can be beneficial for country’s economy in the ways that might not be obvious For example, if a country is producing too much of a certain article of food, it can export the overhead and as such compensate  for the possible economical damage of importing other kinds food required for the healthy diet of an average citizen, whereas if not for importing food the economy would stagnate pretty quick. 

To sum up, I think importing is not necessarily a bad thing, because diversity in food is beneficial for the population’s health and also importing allows for exporting overheads and not worrying about starving the population.

This essay agrees that even the big anount of air travel should not be prohibited. However, both views will be considered.

To begin with, one convincing argument in favor of air travel is that this type of transport does not play a key role in evnironmental pollution. For example, the damage which is produced by the cars is even worse than the planes' influence. In addition, it is obvios that the number of business travels would not be reduced because of world globalisation. People need to go to other states to have an opportunity to make international work together. This confirms that air travel is better to be more popular than other transport, in case it is less harmful for nature and our planet.

On the contrary, there is another side to the issue. Global warming and air pollution (as well as water pollution) are international problems, which shoud be solved by all counties. And since air travel is one of the reasons of our planet's damage, some people claim that the most part of it should be canceled. This idea seems doubtful because it implies that communication between countries (and, later, international relations) would be more complicated.

To my mind, people need to find the way of how the air planes can be improved. Probably it is possible to reduce the damage, which is produced by flights. Nevertheless, air travel is not the only reason of air pollution or global warming. There are heavy industries and a lot of factories in almost every country of the world, which pollute nature and cause global warming too. So, in my opinion, there are many other problems to be solved.

To sum everything up, there are several measures which can be taken to protect nature. One of them is to make air flights even more popular, because they hurt our planet less than cars do. But I strongly believe that the amount of air travel should not be reduced, because this action will only make the international communication more complex, while environmental problems would not be solved.",70,2,2

There is an information about date opened, kilometres of route and passengers per year (in millions).
The first metro was opened in London in 1863. It is also the longest underground among the listen cities, its length is 395 kilometres. In 1900 the underground railway systems was built in Paris. Then this type of transport was opened in Tokyo (1927), then in Washington DC (1976) and Kyoto (1981). The youngest underground was built just 13 years ago in Los Angeles. Because it is constructed rather recently, it has a small distance in kilometers, only 28. However the shortest route of underground is 11 kilometres in Kyoto. This city has a little numerical flow of passengers, over 45 million people per year. But in Tokyo more than one billion people used the underground.
To sum up this information, it is possible to draw a conclusion. Older the underground is than longest kilometres of routes.

However, it is not the most ecologically friendly, and many people claim that it significantly contributes to air pollution and global warming. Whether governments should restrict the use of airplaines to help to prevent serious ecological problems is a controversial issue worth discussing.
There are warious advantages in travelling around the world on the airplane. First of all, one cannot disagree that it is the fastest way to reach a destination. For example, nowadays it is possible to get from America to Australia in about 15 hours, which some years ago seemed absolutely impossible. In addition, airlines may be the only way to help to connect some areas that are situated far away from each other or that people were previously unable to reach. Moreover, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can cause warious difficulties in international communication, cause economical declines in some countires, due to the decreasing number of tourisits visiting them, and may even cause some political problems.
However, it is also hard not to admit the fact that air travel does actually pollute the air. Firstly, since the number of people willing to travel increases every year, the number of aircompaies and airplanes they provide increases respectively. Secondly, in order to lessen the amount of time spent in the air, airplanes that companies produce become faster and stronger and thus, need more fuel and produce more waste. Thirdly, there are another means of transport that are also becoming more popular, such as ships or trains, which may be more ecologically friendly, than modern airplanes.
In conclusion, it can be stated that even though airplanes may not be the most ecologically-friendly way of transportation, it does not seem easy and helpful to reduce thei use. Personally, I understand the concerns that some people may have, however I think that there must be another way to solve environmental problems. Hopefully, in the future there will be a way to build airplaines, that do not produse big amounts of harmful waste.",75,2,3

Secondly, multinational brands often produce products which are made with the world standarts, so you can be sure in consumption of good products.
On the other hand, small local businesses are usually make cheaper goods.

Improvements of hi-teck has not all positive, but also negative sides. With help of social networks and web-sites people all around the world could copy films and music and watch or hear it illegal.
There are two main points of view. The first is supported by musicians, actors and producers, which loose money from piracy in internet. They spend money for creating films and music and they want to earn more. There were many situations, when pirates downloaded films in internet before the premier and film-makers lost some money because people watched it in internet. Some pirates created online cinemas, where people could see films free. Pirates earned money from advertising.  Film-makers and lingers think, that the government schould control the internet and protect property rights of people, who create films and music.
There is also opposite point of view, which is supported by some internet-users and politicians in western countries. They think, that government or police couldn’t affect on internet, because it is free and private space for people all changed the world. Film makers and producers want to earn more money, but people mustn’t pay for their mistakes. Also internet-activists think, that some producers are simply greedy and because of that they want destroy the rules of global network. In many european countries Ycealand, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Finland and other created pirate-parties. These anti-sistem movements protest against the rights of capitalism and global market. Activists from these parties supported internet users and thought that all people all around the world have the right to make in internet everything, that they want. Some of these parties won parlament seats in Europe.
To conclude, I’ed like to say, that producers or film-creators and internet users must create an agreement, which would not only protect their property rights, but also will be comfortable for internet users. If creators will download their intellectual property in internet and users will pay not so much money for it, it would be practically comfortable not only for singers and film-creators, but also for internet-users. Of course, it is not easy to reach the compromise between these communities, but if they would like to fiant the negotiations, it will be useful for all people – for creators and for users.

It is evident that people living in an urban world constantly suffer from a wide range of illnesses and deceases caused by modern developing technology.

There are many health problems that people nowadays come across with. Firstly, it is very complicated to cope with the stress which urban life provides people with. It is hard to calm down being stucked in a traffic congestions which causes lies deep down in human’s desire to build more roads, and to have a nice expensive car to show off about. Secondly, everyone nowadays is aware that ecology of our planer is at a very bad state. The willing to demolish old cultural buildings in order to build more plants and factories end in a bad condition of air no one can breath, in air and water pollution which is very harmful for people’s health.

Although, there are many ways to solve this problem. Firstly, people should reduce their desire to be able to consume every popular or fashionable piece of modern technology in order just to blend in a crowd and not to feel sorry for yourself not having a new expensive toy to play. A lot of health problems can be solved by simply giving up on going to work by car choosing a bicycle instead. Futhermore, people should understand that it is everyone’s duty to preserve nature and to try to prevent pollution from getting worse. Focusing in buiding cultural facilities more than plants and factories can be a great solution for reducing air and water pollution. As a result, people will only breath fresh air and drink clean water setting their mind on beautiful things and challenging thoughts avoiding stress.

They are fond of having some practice at work or seeing the world and having a rest before becoming students. Personally, I believe, in broad terms it is true to some extent. So, let’s consider this matter.
To begin with, it is believed that pupils who just have graduated from a school should immediately become applicants and enter the university. I can easily understand this point of view: traditionally, a few years ago teenagers were eager to continue their education at the same time they had finished a school because a person without a postgraduational qualification was considered as a representative of a law social status. Nowadays a wide range of people share this point of view and try to maintain traditions, entering a university immediately after finishing school. It is worthwhile because these teenagers wouldn’t loose a year and waste their time on some kind of unnecessary stuff. However, there are people against this point of view, according to them, a gap year is a unique opportunity to recharge batteries and think clearly about future education and career. 
As for me, I am into the idea of having spare time between school and university. Firstly, some teenagers are hesitating about their future profession while graduating from a school, they do not know what university to choose. Having a gap year, they are able to have a practice in various spheres and then decide wich one is the most appealing to them and continue developing in this sphere starting their studies at university. Moreover, adolescents are able to work during this period and earn money for their education, so that their parents will not need to pay for it. Aditionally, teenagers can simply have a rest and prepare for their future studying, so that they  will not be exhausted after passing final exams at school.
Considering all the issues, I suppose people are right in giving arguments both : for and against a gap year. However, I am totally sure that having spare time between these  two stages of education would be beneficial of teenagers.

First of all, I am a musician, I compose music. I have 1000$ microphone, 50$ keyboard and other very expensive music staff. I also give a lot of money for recording songs (100$ per song). So, when people buy my music I get some money to continue my work. The “pirates” in the Internet, who download content illegally ruins this system. Engeneers got salary per month, but I am not because of these people, who don’t want to pay 15$ per song. It is less than the coffee cup!

The film producers also lose the huge amount of money because of the pirates. Shooting a film cost millions. All this money is a salary for actors, designers, scenery-writers, operators etc. Producing film is a difficult work, and the advertishment also costs a lot. After shootings the film is showed in a cinema, but there are the people, who must bought tickets? They already watched this film in the Internet, because someone posted it on illegal websites. The industry suffers from the people like these.

In conclusion I must say, that “pirates” should be punished stricktly, because they kill any intentions to create something. I made good music, but but if I want to record some new songs - I need money. There is a lot of directors of the films, who wanted to make a new one (mabe a piece of art?) but he is not able to do that. So, we can say, that illegal downloading of the content stops the progress, and it is quite serious reason to punish these people.

Nowadays, criminalism is a very important topic and also a problem. People always try to isolate criminalists from a society. However, what we really should do? Of course, prisons are a good way to isolate robers killers and maybe n increasing of prison sentences will really reduce crime. Nevertheless, what if the person is not a serial killer or somebody like that but only a small robber. Maybe this person just tried to feed his family. In my opinion, in that case, a longer prison sentence will only increase an opportunity that this person will do a crime again. Of course, people should solve not only consequences of crime, but also work with its reasons. Governments should help crimers. Of course, not everybody can change himself, but I believe that most of people can do it and understand that crimes it is not good and it is really harmful for a society and that everybody should think only about himself. Programs of changing criminalists I think one of the most right way of solving problem, but it is really hard. Another way is to enforce police and other similar infrastructurs. This way of solving problem is much more easier to make, but it will not solve the problem completely. Of course, it will give good results in the beginning stages but the future is unpredictable. All in all, it is very hard to say what is more useful to the for reducing crime. Maybe we should use different combinations of different programs and only with that we will can to achieve our goal.

Even though, percentages for same kinds of products vary depending on type of transportation, manufactured goods are rather popular with approximately a quarter of the whole products’ traffic between countries in Eastern Europe. As for metals, it’s moved by rail roughly 3 times more often than by road. On the opposite, amount of food products transported by road is about 3 times larger. 

Meanwhile, there are some types of goods which are less popular to move between countries. For example, chemicals transportation takes from 11 up to 16 per cent depending on the method of moving them abroad. Similar situation can be noticed for machinery. However, the difference of amounts here are exactly 6 times for various ways of transportation. 

All in all, some kinds of goods are transported abroad more often in general than others. Moreover, the method of moving them from one country of Eastern Europe to another depends on a specific type of a product.

Crime committed by young people is one of the most nowadays burning issues because we are responsible for them as they are our future. Unfortunately, the situation has become worse recently.In my essay I am going to think of reasons and possible solutions.

I believe, there exist many reasons which cause this phenomenon. To begin with, horrible life conditions make people commit crime, especially children. Such basic thing like hunger or lack of money and clothes often can lead to death. Homeless children or children with parents who have some problems with health (drugs, alcohol) grow literally at the street and learn how to survive by stealing things or something worse. Moreover, the spread problem is the bad influence of young people's peers. This is a commom situation when a child wants to be a part of the company and lose connection with his or her parents, become unable to see that everything is getting wrong, and the family does not even notice. Such children can commit vandalizm, steal, begin fightings. They do not know responsibility and think that it is just for fun.Obviously, in all cases children experience some social problems and chose the wrong path.
No doubt, the problem needs to be solved because our future depends on this generation. It is very important to watch and control the process of grwoing, becoming a person.Firstly, parents should pay more attention to their children, to show them that they are not alone, that they are respected and always have somebody to share their problems with. Parents must not lose the connection with young people, but must stay the part of their lives.The proper attutude will never lead to such thoughts like ''commit crime, be in a bad company"". Concerning teachers, they have to practice some social sanctions if they see not appropriate behaviour. For example, low marks, more homework, additional work after lessons, endorse ""good"" pupils and so on.

To sum up everything I have just said, I can state that crime committed by children is a very important issue that can be solved. In most cases parents are the one who are responsible for it. The role of family is the key component for children's growth.It is a fact that we can control young generation and make young people good persons.",65,2,1

The first thing that attracts attention is increase in among of mobile application users from March 2012 to March 2013 – almost to times – from 50 to 100 millions of users. Consequently, there is a tendency to use mobile application rather than desktop. Second bar chart shows that women use Facebook for sharing photos and videos more often mens. However, there is no differences between percentage of men and women who tougt that the main reason for using this social network is receiving updates. It is quite unbelievable that only 30% of people found “receiving updates”  the main reason, because social network is aimed to show updates in people’s lifes and different news. The most unpopular reason is learning about ways to help each other, mostly in mens. I think, it shouldn’t be shoking, because people’s got used to use social network for entertainment, not for work. Summing it up, Facebook is one of the most popular IT organizations in the world, and number of people who use it rapidly increases. So, this organizations should provide wide opportunities for user and try to make reasons for using this social network useful.

Air travel can be one of the possible reasons for the environment to be harmed especially in terms off air pollution. Some people suppose that the best way to reduce the number of flights is government politics, restricting air travel rules and introducing new laws. However, othe people tend to think, that the precise number of flights is not important, while the very proccess of flight, the specifics of airplanes and fossil fuels utilized play the actual role.

As far as each person may know, incroducing environmentally friendly technology is a kind of problem all over the world. First of all, it sould be mentioned, that it costs huge amounts of money. Water clearing equipment or car emissions filters are effective but very difficult to get, prepare and use. Special equipment, which would be used to prevent harmful consequences of air pollution made by airplanes, is hard to fetch and serve. Moreover, it brings a significant problem for state's budget, making flight prices grow steadily and reducing commercial benefits. Taking this into consideration, we can see, that environmental protection based on special equipment, used for modifying airplens, clearing fossil fuels is not so effective as it may initially be seen
On the other hand, it can be proposed, that all the air travel companies should arrange the number of flights they offer, so as to reduce the actual amount of airplanes used. Business or leisure travel made should be suggested less often and only emergency flights or insutrial goods carrying flights might be maintainted at the same level. Firts of all, this way of sollution the air pollution problem seems to be less harmful for economics: while environmental solution mentioned above demands extra expenses on special equipment, this proposal suggests reducing the amount of benefits maintaining the mechanism of the average air flights scheme. Secondly, modyfying airplanes will take much more time that introducing of air flight rules and laws which will probably keep more passengers consuming air travel offers. As we may see, judical or legal way of transforming air travel business (for environmental purposes) tends to be the most effective and less harmful for both passengers and businessmen.

To sum it all up, it should be said, that now the most beneficial way to solve all the problems connected with environmental problems out of air travel is to have some changes in flight politics. Introducing laws and rules, rearranging air travel system means saving the very principle of air travel business, helping the environment at the same time, which seems paradoxically less devoted to environment but more environmentally friendly and effective.",70,2,1

Nowadays, some believe that the prolonged sentence of a prisoner will be a good idea of punishment, while others disagree. In my opinion, the periods of sentence should be discussed to avoid negative effects of the punishment. The reasons for that will be outlined below.    To begin with one should take into account that the longer prison sentence has a beneficial effect on the sentenced. On the one hand, their attitude of the prisoners can be dramatically changed by  their reflection during the period of sentence. As it appears to be not each of the sentenced  is  able to recover after the punishment; moreover, he or she can return to the dangerous activity from the part. As for the society, a longer period of sentence cannot put pressure on them; therefore, victims and their relatives can apply for a psychological help during the period of sentence without thinking over the revenge. However, this solution shows a range of disadvantages for the prisoners. On the one hand, their social detachment may cause further depression; on the other hand, they may not definitely bear and survive strict prison conditions. To consider the other view point one should think over the less problematic solutions for the crime reduction. Though the trainings and rehabs may be considered less effective, these ways of punishment can change the attitude of the prisoners. Instead of prolonging the punishment, one can introduce more educational assessments and trainings to be sure that the prisoner will tend to normal life in future.  In my opinion, strict measures can have a devastating effect on human mind, namely, a longer sentence can damage social nets in the society. As everyone has a chance to recover and stick to a normal life, there should be introduced trainings and recover organizations.   To conclude, a longer prison sentence can cause negative effects in the society. Once introduced, they can destroy personality of the prisoner; however, the sentenced people can be saved and educated.     ",70,2,0

In some years that difference was really impressive, as, for example, in 2006, when the amount of investment in developed countries (about 75 billion dollars) was about 3 times bigger than in developing countries (about 25 billion dollars).

Therefore, they have to use different methods of maintaining competitive. One of them is moving the industries from developed countries to developing ones. Of course, moving the business to developing countries has many advantages. To begin with, when companies develop business in poorer countries, they provide local people with working places, benefiting both workers and the developing countries' economy. In addition, in poorer regions people do not demand high salaries, which allows international companies save money for further development and innovations. Moreover, it is much easier for local people to find a good job or to start running their own business after working for an international company and gaining useful experience. However, we cannot help facing many problems connected with companies who move their factories to poorer countries. First of all, as people in poorer countries have few working places, they are ready to do hard work for rather little money, so companies move their businesses there to enrich themselves without paying attention to the international standarts of working process. Secondly, the quality of produce, which is made by workers with low qualification, is rather likely to suffer. For example, many brends lable the products which are made in Europe or the USA and sell them for much higher prices, as the customers are sure of the quality. Overall, it can be stated that moving the process of production to poorer countries has various advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, it is better to provide people with working places anyway.  Hopefully, in the future it will become possible to reduce the negative aspects of doing business in developing countries by raising international standarts and paying more attention to maintain them. ",65,2,0

It is often said that punishment has to be for both pirates and users. But it is more frequently believed that downloading files for free do not have to be considered offensive. 

In my opinion, pirates have to be punished, but not users. So I can only partially agree with the idea of punishment of authors rights breakers.

On the one hand, pirates activity is illegal as they are stealing music, films and other media products for free. They break codes and download files for other people. They are active in process of stealing so this kind of activity requires a punishment.

On the other hand, users constitute a passive side. They are not stealing, they just take files that are already hacked and given for everyone for free. Some of them do not even think about authors rights. Also using pirate files is just a consequence caused by the pirate’s activity. there are too much people downloading illegal files to punish everyone.

In conclusion, I believe that hackers have to be punished, but taking files that are already given free and downloaded by others don’t have to be considered illegal. We just have to deal with the cause, but not with the consequences that already exist.

Solving the problem of hacking media files will automatically decrease the problem of illegal downloading. But punishing everyone taking something that a lot of other people take has no sense, as we will have to deal with almost every human having access to the Internet.

The sector of under-the-low sector in these sphere may be a great obstacle in media distributing and development. Although author rights appreciation should become common, I could not agree with the concept of olligatory punishment for both traders and users.

To my mind, campagain against illegal distributing should be based on the correct price regulation. Also it must be combined with sites and programmed moderation. It is more rational just to prevent hardships with illegal lusiness than put in motion governmental punishment. For example, programme ITunes maked by apple provides legal access so the music and film archives just on the payment lease. Government just observe for example, Internet nel-sily and ban these who enlarge she ability of illegal free acess.

On the other hand, in several country there is no special lows for this issue regulation. Many companies, musicians and film producers located in the countries nish specific terms of distribution of media products, brake conflicts just license of collaboration with country without strong regulations that emerges, illegal hady and acting. In this case it is also easier to prevent international misunderstanding just by making compositions or film of specific comoser or filmmaker inaccesible as, for experience, social net VKontakte made. So politicy of pretension may be more effective in countries without special regulations.

To sum up, shuggling against illegal against illegal business is an important part of every trade regulation. But it should not be presented on criminal level with the government inhifuence. The solution of prolem lay in the sphere of strict moderacy and private sites’ or companies’ regulation.

There are several possible causes of this development. Firstly, there is a huge influence of mass media and different video games. They substitute books that were read a lot by older people. Usually books teach us right things. However, young people prefer TV shows and video games. There is too much cruelty on a TV. Even news programs often show us killed people or tell us about different crimes. When young people see it every fay, they don't percieve it as something bad. They just get used to it. There is the same problem with video games. In some of them you have to kill people in order to complete a task. Moreover, in some of them other people are controlled by real players.
However, there are still several ways to solve the problem. Parents should dedicate more time to communicate with their kids, to explain what is good and what is bad. In other words, parent are responsible for forming their children's values. Unfortunately, some adults think that they only should provide kids with basic goods and give them a good education. As for teachers, they also have a huge influence on children, because they spend a lot of time together. Teachers can advice kids to read books that teach us traditional values.
Young people commit more and more crimes and it causes a lot of concerns. We should make some steps to solve this problem and make this world a peaceful place.

In my opinion, laws, Constitutions and other official documents should be adapted to the new reality. The Internet have given more opportunities to thefts including pirating. The law have to adept to this situation and find a way to punishe such a crime.
Pirate content cause great damage to artists and producers, and this is a problem that the Goverment should take care of. Leaders of countries are meant to protect their people and the civil rights in the country. Since pirating leads to damage for other people, the Government simply have to stop it. And the punishment is the most effective solution.
Downloading and sharing music or films on the internet is fatal to the industry. Musicians and producers are not able to receive benefits of their work, and due to that they may lose the motivation to create new films or music. In order to help the industry to survive, the pirates must be persecuted.
In conclusion, I would like to point out that existance of illegal pirate content is a significant modern problem. In my opinion, the only possible solution of it is presecution of pirates and, possibly, more severe punishments for them.

TASK 2
	Nowadays, health issues are really great in terms of importance. Every person worries about his or her health problems. But how such problems could be solved? Today there are two main points of view on this question.
	First of all, some people claim that the more sports facilities are the healthier people are. The lack of neccessary sports equipment is the main problem as they say. People need more gyms, yards with sports facilities and so on. Their idea looks like: ""A gym a day - keeps the doctor away"".
	On the other hand, there is another point of view. Others people are persuaded that such way of improving public health is useless. Health problems are not always connected with sport. Moreover, sport could be a reason of different illnesses. So, a lot of other measures should be required.
	As for me, both opinions are very essential. Nevertheless, my point of view gravitates to the first one. I consider that being a sportish person means being a healthy person. Man or woman cannot avoid all illnesses, but with sports activities it would be much easier. Furthermore, sport does not provide any health, but also gives beautiful body. Keeping fit means being fashionable today. Last but not least is that a person will be less strsssful with sport. When you are under a big pressure you can relax due to sport and have a nice mood. All that points are the reasons of my opinion. Sport help people to be healthy and happy. That is why new equipment will improve public health.
	To sum up, there are a lot of different opinions health problems. However, I choose the point of view about sports' importance. I am strongly persuaded that it is worth doing sports.

Every society tries to save itself from killers, robbers etc. There is an opinion that lawbreakers should be sentenced in prisons for a long time, because it can prevent crimes. However, some people who suppose there must be other solutions. The point of view that the society has no right to punish a man, even if he has committed a crime, is quite widespreaded. That does not mean that there should not be jails for those who broke the law. The only thing is that we do not punnish a criminal, but to prevent danger sentence him to the jail. It is evident, that just becoming a prisoner is not enough. Firstly, psychologists, social workers and other specialists have to give to the prisoner helping hand. And every psychologist would say that there is nothing good for one's behaviour in long sentences. Secondly, a sentenced person must not feel suffered from other members of society due to the fact it provokes the feeling of hate and agression in him. The expereince of the Norway's penitentiary system can be regarded as the best example how does it work, because in this country the percantage of people who committes crime again after the prison is very low. Finally, we see that this way of sentecing is an advantege for society. Nevertheless, many people see some drawbacks in it. They consider the criminal as the enemy of society, not their ""brother"" who has made a mistake. Such people understand the penitentiary system as ""eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth"" model of relationsheeps. Of course, it sounds logic, but simultaneously inhuman.   Thus, every country may choose what principals to choose and how to consider the criminal. We just should remember that our decision depict the level of пвддкыз of society  ",60,2,4

I, for one, agree with this statement. 

Today the technology has spread so wide, we can’t even live without it. We are always staring on the tiny screens of our phones, or on screens of our computers. Thisconstant staring has our eyes being focused all the time and thus provokes all the eye problems one can imagin. The quality of our eyesight falls with every day, making us wear glasses. The other problem wich comes with the modern technology is caused by our personal computers. For example, I spend a lot of time sitting in my chair before my computers screen playing games or doing my work. What is the problem here? Well, from sitting in one pose for such a long time I can get back pain, or even get a posture problem. Worst case I might even got long-lasting problems with my spine.

But how can we solve these problems? First of all, everyone working with a computer, watching their TV or using their phone should perform eye gymnastics ever so often. Basically, you should focus your sigt on something far and then spin your eyes for a bit. Secondly, if you are sitting for a long time you should stand up and do a little workout from time to time. This includes a bit of stretches, jumps and squats . On the greater scale of things, it would be great of everyone just started running in the mornings. These runs would solve a lot of physical problems for a lot of people and make health of the nation much better as a whole.

I am strongly concerned that new stadiums, developing sport activities, promotion of extraordinary kinds of sport are the golden opportunity for every person on the planet. To be perfectly  honest, each day we spend a lot of time setting (in front of the computer, at school, at university and so on) and by the end of the day the majority of us have the terrible back-ache or head-ache. To overwhelm the pain it is good to do some sport or to run a circle at the stadium. It is a well-known fact, that every activity helps to change the mood.
From the other point of view, not every person likes training or is keen on sport. For those people there are alternatives. For example, modern medical service, green parks in the city, fresh air. To speak the truth, sometimes the lack of basic medicine is the key problem. In this way, there is no activity that would help you.

Every single person works to acquire goods such as food, clothes, vehicles, gadgets and more. Along with this trend huge corporations are coming to the arena, offering high-quality (or not) products and professional customer service devouring small local businesses. In this essay I want to discuss the pros and cons of this problem.
Firstly, the domination of a brand increases the chance of monopolization, which is damaging for the economy of the country and for the customers. The corporation gets the power to dictate the rules of the market such as lowest price range for the product and making the situation worse for the other producers.
Secondly, thriving corporations give us less freedom as the consumers. The root of the problem is the decrease of the opportunities for small businesses. The less the competitivenes among businesses the less benefits for the customers. It is widely known that this process is the engine of the economy.
On the other hand, multinational brands provide us with a convenient service, considering it was all done by professionals, maximum comfort and unforgettable shopping experience. That is why the most of us opt for Wallmart as a weekly shopping place. It is more reliable and fast.
Overall, I can say that disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Corporations hurt the national economy and taking our customer freedom. This issues should be tackled by the governments with special legislations to decrease their power.",70,2,1

The problem is that people nowadays prefer download some films and music albums from internent. As a result, musicians and film producers lose their money, because none of people want to buy their works.
As for me, I agree with this point of view. And I also will try to prove it. The first thing is, that musicians and film producers waste their time and nerves while makeing something new. A lot of my friends are musicians and they say that it is realy hard to record something good without having enough maney. Imagine how wasteful the film is: operators work, paying to actors etc. Pirate copies make musicians and film producers less motivated, because in the end they get almost no money for their work. The second thing is, that every musician need money. It is well known fact that domestic recordings are not so good. Recording in a studio costs a lot of money; the same thing with mastering a composition or song. Musicians hope that they will sell their recording for example in i-tunes and earn some money to make new music and new albums. This second fact shows that music industry is too wasteful like cinema and pirate copies destroy the enthusiasm of musician. The last fact about such topic is that concerts don’t give enough money to cover all wastings. We can say that cinema industry has the same problems too.
But some people say that they don’t need money to produce something new. For example in underground culture money don’t play an important role. The concept of underground may seem strange. Films and music contains strong language and forbidden topics. It is clear that people won’t pay any money for that. Pirate copies are not forbidden in underground; reverse, this culture adore this. Illegal copies make free advertisment for some musicians.
To sum up, I would like to say that illegal copies influence really bad on film producers and some musicians because as we can know from above these two industries needs a lot of money. But for others, pirate copies seems so good. It’s their point of view. As for me, (as I said before) illegal copies will be always bad thing in internet.

This essay firstly will discuss the main cause of the health problems, secondly the essay will offer some solutions. 

First of all, the cause of the great number of health problems is not the technology, but  overusing technology in life. Before widespread of televisions and phones people preferred to meet each other, to walk in parks, o spend time with family, playing sport games, or even to camp. Nowadays more and more individuals spend their free time behind TV or computer. For example, it can be noticed that children like to play videogames in modern life, may be even more than play with each other in football, basketball and other activities. 

Nevertheless, some solution to the problem are exist. The government can provide social programs to stimulate people to do sport, it can predict them from health problems. For example, they can create different  programs with sport activity in parks, people will interest something new and if they will spend more time on thresh air, it will be a good point for their health. The government can also provide help for some groups, for instance, to buy card to gym with sales. 

To conclude, the main cause of majority of diseases in present is the widespread use of modern  technology. People forget about activities, sport and benefit of fresh air and spend a lot of time on the sofa behind the TV and computers. Government should stimulate people to do sport, providing social programs and help.

This trend highlighted by newspapers and TV shows attracts public attention and raises a question of possible causes and solutions of the prominent problem.
In a modern world, young people can obtain an easy access to the information published in the Internet, which includes a wild range of cruel TV-series and games. It is a well-known fact that watching TV and playing video games leads to increased violence among people.
Being active users, young people transfer the actions and behavior from imaginary worlds to the real one. Moreover, the pace of living of today’s adults implies that they have less time left for bringing up their children if they choose to pursue their careers. As a results, kids are not aware of proper public and social rules. What is even more important, the lack of parents’ attention pushes them to cruel and violent behavior on the streets. The growing concerns about the issue lead to an active discussion and enforce the society to solve the problem.
Children spend a great part of their time with parents. The latter could explain social rules in more details and save kids from negative impact of others.
Young adults’ behavior is the result of the upbringing and parents affect it directly. If they explain better what is allowed and what is prohibited, the number of teenagers’ crimes will plummet. Moreover, if parents keep their kids busy with hobbies and interact with them more actively, children will have less time on cruel video games. The second part of kids’ time is spent in school. Teachers could influence students, being more patient and paying more attention to their lives. The school community could organise a series of meetings on psychological support. If children feel that they are not deprived of help in times when they are in trouble, they will not commit crimes.
The increased level of young adults’ crimes is a warning signal in a modern world. Teenagers and children spend more time playing cruel video games and watching poor quality TV shows that lead to violence and crimes.
Parents and teachers have to pay closer attention to the problems of the growing generation and help them to overcome their troubles, otherwise the rate of crimes commited by young people will only climb.

We use it much more usually than before. However some people believe that widespread use of technology  can cause a lof of healthy problems. This essay argues with this opinion. This assay discuss this belief and some of those health problem. Also it supplies possible solutions of these problems. 

First of all, there is no doubt that modern people spend a lot of their time near the computer: playing computer games, finding the information for education, working, etc. And we can not even imagine our life without computer. However, sitting by the computer can cause some different problems with health. For example, problems with eyes, which can be caused by usual watching on the screen. Also everybody knows that some people prefer spending time near the computer, not doing sports. And it can be a reason for many problems: overweighting, problems with heart and etc. 

Further, there are a lot of technologies which help people to do their household chores. Undoubtedly, household chores is not the think which most people like to do but f someone do not this kind of activity, he can become lazier and move less. And it can cause the same problem as sitting near the computer for a long time (overweighting and so on). Also people move less due to delivery all good that they want (it is unnecessary to go to the shop to buy something), opportunity to gel all information from the Internet (there is no need to go to the library) and etc. 

The possible solution of these problems is making sport more popular. The first step for this goal is making it cheaper, because sometimes people who want to do sport can not do it because they have not enough money. Secondly, there should be less advertising of technologies and more advertising of different kinds of sports (also of healthy food and healthy lifestyle). Then more people will understand that sport is necessary and pleasure activity. Further, there should be more special lessons (at school, for example) where students will be tough to live a healthy lifestyle, not to spend a lot of their time using the computer. 

In conclusion, I can say that the widespread use of technology cause many healthy problems And the possible solution of this situation is giving people knowledge about their health and healthy lifestyle and making sport more popular.

Some
people consider that it is very dangerous for environment and the government should establish laws 
against air travel. But othes disagree with it. 
  I agree with people, who think that air travel has more benefits than disadvanteges. On the one
hand, inspite of the fact that plains warm nature, it is the most fast kind of transports. In our
world time is valuable resurs, therefore air travel is very usuful for different business trip. 
Also, according to statistics, plains is the most safety transport. The goverment will save more
peoples life if they produce move plants. Moreover, usually people want to travel to travel to 
distant coners of the world and it will very long trip, if they use bus or train. If they use air 
travel, they do go to necessary place in short time.
  On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. For example, it is air pollution. However, if we
talk about all transports in the world, then we can see that each of it warm nature. All transports
produce different dangeous gases and it is harmful for environment and our health. Besides, 
nowadays air travel is very expensive. It is bad fact for families with low incomes.
  In conclusion, I want to say that there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of air 
transport. Every  person chooses what he or she really prefer. However, air travel is important 
transport and the government should't establish laws, which don't let people to travel on plants.

A lot of sportsmen try to cheat to become a winner, to be the first and the best. Of course, honest sportsmen that do not use such drugs or doppings cannot show their results they cannot realize themselves. 
So, different sports organizations ban that athletes-cheaters for a limited period. I think this is the right decision. Otherwise, there are some people that think that cheaters should be banned permanently and they should not ever had a chance to continue their sport career. 
In my opinion, if the cheater was caught for the first time, he or she should be banned for a limited period. However, if the cheater was caught for a second time, he or she should be banned forever. I think so because all people make mistakes sometimes. And people can change their views by time, they can understand their previous mistakes and be better than they were. Actually, when we ban cheaters forever, we do not even give him a chance to be better, to think over his mistake. And when we do this it looks like some kind of “sport execution”. However if we will just “punish” for two years and not “execute”, we are able to make a better person. Unfortunately, if the sportsman will fail again, we ban him forever.
I believe that such rules are strict, because not honest sportsmen will be afraid of permanent ban and will not even ask someone about illegal drugs. I also think that there has to be special investigations that will help to find dealers of this kind of drugs. Sport competitions like the Olympic Games should be honest, because the main reason you took part in it is to prove something to yourself and not to others.

Some of them develop in rich cities, countries, anothers one business in a little and poor places. What the reason do they have? Firstly, it should be noticed that the international companies share their products, services and open largest possibilities. These companies move the customers on the side. For example, if the Coca-Cola companie opens their offices in Nigeria, employs certain local habitants and the prices for their production will have been moved to more comfortable, then Coca-Cola companie become more popular in the world, because they support poor countries. Secondly, against this point of view there is a lot of disagreements. Offices in developing countries could have a lot of finances problem. If big companie move to the little developing country, this companie will jump in the “finance hole” and this sharing will become a crysis for officers in these countries. Like wise employing people might lose their jobs and in this case products of such an international companies should lose their benefits by customers. Overall, I can say, that this way for business could be really dangerous but it also could win this struggle. Population of poor countries could love this services and, in the future, when countries will become one big customers group, which will be ready pay any price to buy products from the companie then has supported. It is really discussing question and in my opinion it will be really hard to find an answer.

Some people argue that these sportsmen must be excluded from competitions for the rest of their lives. Now I try to discuss both views.
To begin with, the amount of illegal drugs has increased over time. Thus, many athletes are not aware of it and they continue to consume illegal drugs as usual things. For example, we know a lot of cases than the group of people who run large competion passed a strict law about new illegal drugs. So, many competitors cannot go to this contest. However, others say that athelets should know about the changes of reglament.
Secondly, every situation is special. So, I think that every illegal act of athlete should be looked separately. Nevertheless, there are must be one union law for all sportsmen.

Such people are pirats and I’m fully agree with the point of view that the pirats should be punished.
First of all, the musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. That’s why the quality of music and films is decreasing. Because the artists don’t get one full amount of money, they couldn’t use it to make better music or films, they don’t have any evidences that their next work wouldn’t be downloaded from the Internet for free.
Secondly, it’s obviously, that every work should be paid off. For example, we pay for the food in the supermarket or for the any other material thing. But it’s hard to pay for something that you can’t feel in your hand. But, as for me, there is the same logic and people don’t download the film, for example, they steal it, like they can steal a fruit in the supermarket.
Thirdly, when we buy an illegal copy of the product, we don’t get the full emotions, because of such copies have the bad quality, not so beautiful print, for example, and many other things. Moreover, I think, that buying one pirate copy of the music or film we don’t make a special connection between the artist and the consumer.
And last, but not least, is that the illegal pirate copies aren’t good for the economy of the countries. Buying the legal copy, you pay a special fee, which can be used, for example, for the social systems of the country. Stealing the music you make bad things for the artists, but for the other citizens of the country too. 
All in all, the pirats should be punished, because they are stealing the product like some thing in the shop. They are just tipical thief who who are destroing the economy of the country and don’t get the full spectrum of emotions from the amazing works of musicians and film producers.

Although, in some regions the rate had changed, the difference between it in 2014 and 2015 is not tremendeous. Secondly, North Africa tends to have the highest unemployment rate.
As it can be seen on the chart, the most dramatic change in the unemployment rate takes place in the Middle East. The rate has fallen down from 11% to 9,6%, thus the difference accounts in 1,4%. Similar tendency can be observed in the Latin America, where the difference in the rate between two given years is 1%. Apart from this two regions the unemployment rate stays stable. In North Africa and South Asia the figures are exactly the same, while in Europian Union they have slightly changed.

Obviously, increasing scores of crimes are making usual life more dangerous for everybody and thus, this number of crimes should be decreased by society actions. But firstly we should answer questions how such a situation could be possible and whether the goverments are guilty for this.
In my opinion, one of the most important reason why children do so many crimes is the regulation of the child labour. Nowadays, it's quite hard for children to get some not very complicated job. In order to defend children from users of their labour, goverments have closed the majority of opportunities to work for children. On the other hand, there is an another potential reason. The law violation is often considered by something brave at teenagers’ society. Frankly speaking, it is very actual for ex-USSR countries
Therefore, there are several ways to decrease young people crime rates. These ways do not exclude each other. Firstly, parents should try to provide extra work for their children, then they will have extra money and no extra time for potential crimes. School institutions also should help children to find a part-time work. Secondly, somebody should provide respect to law in the teenagers’ minds. I think that teachers can not do very much to provide such a law respect, it is also kind of a part of parent obligations.
Actually, maybe there are more reasons of such a crime boom, but I think that reasons stated above are one of the most important. That is why some actions against these reasons, sort of easing of teenagers’ employment or teaching of law respect, can strongly affect the current situation.

To begin with, such kind of people as a rule have their own view of the world that are not always normal and differ from the majority. Moreover, actions of some musicians are unpredictable and nobody knows what strange thing they can do at some moment. In addition, the ideas of actors, painters and etc are not so smart but have a bad influence on their fans. So a person thinks: “my idol said it, so it is right”.

Secondly, there is no garanty that the idea of our idol is right and helps us in future, mistakes are happened. Thirdly, there is not competence of artists to give advice for people, it is not their job.

Moreover, LinkedIn is less popular among the young people than among the elder ones! Perhaps, this may indicate a difference in interests of old and young people?

At general, people of age 65+ are less active in all 3 social networks than all other age groups, but there is no big decrease in Facebook relatively to younger people.

At first, it is very important to mention some of the problems with health caused by modern technologies: (1) the number of people suffering from the heart desease at a young age increases noticably; (2) due to the increasing number of cars and public transport the noise pollution affects people stronger which leads to headache; (3) moreover, it is important to point out that the air pollution, global warming and other ecological factors are the main reason for the cancer which does not have a cure at a present time; (4) after all, because of a sitting lifestyle (sitting near the TV, computer, etc.) people have very dangerous problems with their backs.
So, what is the most relevant way to reduce the enormous number of heath problems people have in the modern world? Firstly, it is necessary to control the ratio of the air pollution in big cities: if the air is polluted more than it is not dangerous for citizens there should be some restriction for car holders by the government in the city. Secondly, the government should increase some ecological projects which can improve the ecological situation.
Overall, the number of health problems caused by modern technology could be reduced if there are some measures improving the ecological situation in a country.

It should be said that their age there different age groups. One of them is from 0 to 14 years, second is from 15 to 59 year and the last one is 60+ years. In Yemen in 2000 the biggest part of all population was taken by the age group which in the first and it was equal to 50,1 percent. The least of population “60+ years” age group they were about 4%. In 2050 age situation in Yemen will be changed. The biggest part of all population will be “15-59 years” age group. Talking about Italy, it must be said that in 2000 “15-59 years” age group were 61,6% from population. The least part were “0-14 years” group. Which were equal to 14,3% percent. In 2050 the both “15-59 years” and “60+ years” grops wiil be almost equal. “0-14 years” age group will be equal to 11,5%.

Of course, there are several reason, why boys usually choose other kind of proffession, than girls. But I suppose, there is no need to give a university instructions of what the propotion of male and female student should be.
Some people consider, that having the equal number of boys and girls in the particular university will bring more possibilities for communication. Certainly, I can't disagree with this statement. Moreover, it will be better for student's social development. But we can't ignore the fact, that the main aim of high education is to bring up great proffesionals. So, I'll try to emphasize the most significant characteristics of why the equal ammount of males and females is not important for studying.
First of all, everybody knows , that boys and girls tend to choose different sorts of proffessions. We can note it even at school, when usually boys are better in physics , mathematics , chemistry. While girls are likely to prefer literature , foreign lenguages, history. And this situation isn't bad, because it is natural.
Secondly, in some regions this propotion is at high level because of some geographical reasons. For example, in China the population of men is great enough . As we can see, boys are born more frequently than girls.
Furthemore, sometimes women don't want to get a high education level. So, they usually become housewifes, and they like to take care of their families and consider it as a profession.
In conclusion I would like to mention , that, according to my oppinion, the idea of acception equal number of boys and girls in universities seems to me unreliable.

In my opinion, the most prominent reasons for a high crime rate among young people is a lack of sufficient education in school and high inequality between social classes. Nowadays school provide not enough educational materials and lectures related to the topic of crime. Students do not acknowledge how dangerous their inappropriate actions might be for society and for themselves. As an example, we can observe increased cases of shooting at schools and colleges. Another significant cause of crimes committed by young people is increasing inequality in society. Young people from the lower classes of society are not satisfied with this state of affairs, which drags them to committing more robberies and thefts. Take a student who lacks money for his education and living. The only way for him to get money is to violate the law because he cannot find an appropriate job.
Considering the causes of high crime rate among young people, schools and parents should provide more education to young people. Teacher and parents should speak more about the danger of becoming a criminal and suggest that young people can achieve success without being perpetrators.
Taking into account all above-mentioned factors, it is obvious that high amount of young criminals constitutes a serious problem with deep causes. It is to be hoped that educational methods would help in combating this social illness.

The essay will discuss some major health problems and it will develop possible solutions. 

First of all, it is evident that gadgets can cause some health problems for those who use them. The major problems that doctors report about are problems with eyes and with obesity. Eye diseases occure when people are using their electronic devices, especially if gadgets do not have eye-friendly screens or they are used close to eyes. Number o problems with overweigh rises because people became less active due to new technologies. For example, American scientists found out that every third American had problems with eyes in 2010, comparing to 15% in 1990. They said the main reason is the popularity of modern gadgets. Thus, modern technologies really can affect user’s health. 

However, these problems can be solved and many states now implement some of the possible solutions. Manufacturers contribute to this by creating new gadgets or software which will stimulate owners to some physical activities, as an example, popular game Pokemon Go allows players to level up only by doing some activities like walking or running. Possible solution for the problems with eyes is to develop new screens which will not be harmful. Governments can help with this by financing researches. That means that these problems can be solved or at least damage can be reduced. 

In conclusion, there are some significant health problems caused by gadgets, but solutions for them can be developed.

I am completely disagree with this statement, because nowadays many countries just cannot produce enough food, so they have to import one from other countries. For instance, African’s and Arabic’s countries, due to their climat, it is impossible to them reject other’s countries food. 

However, many people may call science as solution for this problem, it means those counties should use modern agricultural technics to provide food. Also, people who support the idea of decreasing import, may say that it is dangerous then the amount of food depends on external countries’ industry. 

When talk about modern agricultural it just hard to apply to Africans and Arabics countries dependencies it is not one-direction interaction, because Africans and Aabiccs countries which export food to them also depends from they oil production, And it is not more dependence, but something like cooperation.

To sum up, there are no reasons to produce food only for countrie’s production and decrease import. It is opposit, share and exchange recouces between countries usually cause positive effect.

For example, if children spend a lot of their free time outdoors, they will be stronger. Due to different sport activities the illness can be redused. More than that, different sports like football or basketball is not only healthy, but it is also very interesting. On the other hand, sport is just a part of healthy lifestyle. If people want to improve their health, they should remember about healthy diet. First of all, government should provide clear water to all regions of the country and avoid different products with GMO. Moreover, people should eat more vegetarian products and don’t allow them fride food. Another measure is properly treatment and good medical servise. As for me, I agree, that sport is essential part of healthy lifestyle and it is important measure for improving national health. But of course, we should not forget about other ways to improve public health, such as healthy diet and good public medical service.

It can also be seen that the youngest women (16-24 years old) and the oldest ones (over 75 years old) spent twice less time (or even less) exercising than men of these ages (114,1 minutes vs. 282,2 minutes and 10 minutes vs. 29,2 minutes respectively).

The main advantage of such a development is that international companies contribute to the economic development of poorer country by creation of new working places, which brings people the opportunity to earn more money and so that improve their living conditions get a better education and so on. In addition, the product produced in the host country is much more cheaper than the same one from another country, so more people afford to buy it.

Some people think that countries only need produce the food for their own population and should import as little products as possible. I disagree to this point of view.

Firsty, import is very important to international economics. For some countries import is one of the main sources of income. For undeveloped and developing countries import is quite important - money which these countries get from import can be used for economical development. So, it makes import necessary for countries to work.

Secondly, it is impossible for one country to produce all the food they need due to several various reasons. Some countries are just too small and they do not have enough land. Countries have different climat conditions and that affects to the amount and quality of the food they can produce. Rough climat in some countries does not allow to produce food at all. Also, in some countries climat conditions are not suitable for producing some types of food. Without import their choice of food will be limited. That is why import is necessary - it allows people to choose that they want to eat from the wide range of products. Moreover, import makes possible for people to buy in their countries exotic fruits and vegetables.

Downloading your favourite film for free or getting a new music album is obviously easy but ab illegal way and leads to a serious problems. 
How can we deal with this problem? I personally think that people who share illegal music and film files are theviers. For example, lets take a look at worldwide news, the company “Pirate bay were serving free films, books, music, nowadays the owner of that company is in jail because of illegal sharing copies. It’s a great example of bad outcome. Firstly, we need to support artists, by buying a film or CD, DVD we support people who do their job and, hence, as a result not supporting, helping crime business to grow. To prevent the work of  lillegal pirate coping some companies started releasing an original CD’s only at the authentical stories and some decided to fight with counterfeit by putting galagraghic sticker in production. The fight with counterfeit is crucial, if there are any ways of cutting-off pirates we need to support it by buing original copies. In Russia we have a planty amount of groups and people who fight with such problems. It is important not to only critisize the pirates but to support the authors by buing real CD’s, investing personal money to author. 
All in all, the whole problem is accute and up to date -, partly because these days in the era of Internet people replace CD’s with mp3’s but frankly speaking, I came to the conclusion that we have to fight with all the pirate counterfeit in the most effective ways as it possible. It may seem an oldie but if you pay for every author job the world will chair.

To my mind, government should introduce some laws that will reduce quantity of unusefull flights for business and leisure. To start with, there are many private flights owned by rich people that transport few passangers and have luxurious furniture and design on the board. It is no more that irrational usage of resources to let such kind of air travel exist. Moreover such flights spend a lot of disel which poison the atmosphere. It would be better to introduce some taxes for private air traveling. The second reason to reduce the amount of air travel is to cut the number of free places on the board. There is the information that many flight companies sell not all of their places, so flights are only 80% fulled. However, there are a lot of people who would buy tickets at a lower price. Companies can introduce actions the day before flight to sell all their places and reduce consumption of energy. As the result pollution and greenhouse effect will cut down. The third down is a huge quantity of old flights that need to be renovated, they do not use latest innovations in bio-energy. Big energy helps to safe atmosphere from global warming. To sum up, there are many reasons to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. It’s a common knowledge that many flights are unnecessary, so it would be better for government to pay attention to them and introduce some laws.

Every year the amount of such problems is being increased. That's because the governments suggest various sollutions, for example, to minimize the number of business and leisure air travels. Is it could be a good idea? There is a question.
First of all, I'd like to say, that the amount of air travels regulates by market. There is a living system, and all the changes, when come from outside, can kill it. We can't say, that a part of actual air travels are unnecessary. If it could be so, they would be canceled by companies.
Also, if we look at this problem more deeply and so through the statistics of the most dangerous types of transports for air, we will find out that air travel isn't a leader. Cars bring much bigger amount of pollution to the air. However, it's more difficult to reduce the amount of personal transport, than a number of air travel. That's why we are talking about it. Actually, we have some examples, when the governments reduced the amount of cars in cities, but it was made to make a transport system more free and not for minimizing an air pollution. Such politics were provided in Singapure. And now, it has become an example of perfect urbanization. However, as I said, it can't change a situation of air pollution or global warming as far as such changes are too minimal.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that providing such serious changes without deep, constructive analyze, will lead to crusial faults. It means, that if governments is going to reduce an amount of air travels, they should listen to all the opinions and all the side should be agreed with final solution.

Air travel plays a great role in this issue because of burning a lot of fuel during the flights. So many people think that governments should decrease the number of unnecessary traveling (for example for business and lisure). However I strongly believe that in our age of information the rapide of movement between cityes is extremely important both for busimessmen and others, so we can not to reduce amount of air travel without significant economical conseqencis. 
First of all air travel is a fastest way of movement between cities. So all of us neet it because we haven’t got enough time to travel by bus or train. For example somebody have holidays and want to have relax in other country – he cannot do this without flyghts. More over such method of problem decision provides to reduce in foreign investments which help to economical growth. It will hapen bause foreign companies should control their founds and do it fact, however it becames rather difficult to do if governments force them to use alternative transport that as much slower. So such law inithiative deglohalize world economy.
To sum up, it is clear that global worning and air polution are crusial issues of all of us. However as I see government should find another ways to tackle this quastion, because air traveling is very significant part of our life. It is helpful both for business and others.

It may be any problems connected with relationships between student and teacher or between students. These problems can making schoollife terrible, if people would not try to solve it. 

In my opinion, one of the reason for bad student behaviour is missunderstanding. Sometimes student do not understand what teacher want and why. For example, student do not recognize why he have to do hometask, came to all classes. He do not understand that he need it.

Sometimes students cannot to start relationships between each other. Then they feel stress and uncomfortable. It can be cause of problem behaviour too.

I strongly believe that all this problems can be solved, if teacher and student try it. Sometimes peopel need just to tolk to each other to solve any problem. Students should have a possibility ti discuss their problems with teachers. It will make teaching process more comfortable and pleasure. Moreover, if students and teachers will have a relationships such a friend, they would avoid a conflict.

In conclusion I would say that it is a neccessary to have good relationships with classmaters and teachers to be successful in studing. It may be hard, but you can to changhe the situation just to tolk to other people and discussing problem.

In fact, modern children and teenagers have got freedom of actions not realising, though, a higher responsibility they are to bear now in comparison with the same age group of the past. Indeed, it is vital for their mentors, first of all, to take urgent measures in order to seize the control of youths' behaviour. In this essay I will analyse the main reasons for such a trend proposing a number of possible ways as how to change it.

The first factor that have a negative impact on children's mind is the media. Actually, the abundance of TV programs, newspaper articles and other sources demonstrate real murders, terroristic attacks, just horror films that people get used to very quickly despite the age. For this reason, parents and teachers should track what their children watch and read at school as well as during their leisure controlling state of their mind.
Another cause of the aggressif behaviour is simply the lack of attention. Unfortunately, nowadays parents are often too busy working their way up the career ladder so that young people have to spend most of the time only on their own. That is why, it is essential, as much as possible, to discuss with children their problems, friends, plans for future. The same is true for teachers, they could organise some meetings of psychological grounds, for instance, in order to get close to students and provide them with an opportunity to voice their worries and ideas.

Finally, young people often follow a slippery slope becoming criminals because they have nobody to look up to. It is necessary for a growing individual to take an invaluable life experience after their mentors. To put it another way, parents as well as teachers should share their skills with children setting a positive example to them. Also they can help them to find a prominent social figure to follow who would inspire children throughout the whole life.

Taking everything into account, modern young people are heavily influenced by the community they are exposed to. In order to draw a line under the number of crimes commited by youths, it would be really feasible, in any case, for parents and teachers to bring harmony to their relationship paying a significant attention to their wishes and needs.",70,2,0

It is doubtless that lack of oxygen is caused by traffic volume and factory production. Because of it people suffer from headack, depression and bad mood. The solution of this situation is rather clear. The humanity has to barely reduce the number of factories, develop and use different meanings of transport and plant more trees. Of course, the idea is easy, but it will be stressful for people to refuse from such facilities.

One more problem is connected with Internet, computers and gadgets. Deseases caused by them started from illnesses of back or eyes and ended by problems with emotional aspect. Talking about the last one, nowadays children become less communicable, more tired and stressed. Therefore, it can be a resone of even suicide. To my mind, the plummet of using computer, video game and the Internet is required. The solution of this problem totaly depends from parents.

It is quite obvious that younger people in England do more activities than elder people what is shown by the fall towards the age of 75. This pattern may be noticed both for English men and women. However, the crucial defference between sport life of both genders is that men do less exersises that women at all what can be suppotret by the figures given in this bar chart.

Considering any form of art a way to speak about something hardly anyone can make any restrictions without breaking the essential human rights. Meanwhile I think it is necessary to give all the freedom to any artist, it still seems fair to me that piece of art can somehow hurt other people, so the government restrictions can be used only for protection but not for limiting one's will to express himself.
Due to the fact that contemporary art is developing and becoming more and more extraodinary, some people can say that the government should restrict such perfomance that can somehow hurt feeling of other people. The scandalous organisation ""Pussy Riot"", which had punk pray in the cathedral, is still being discussed. All the people are divided into two fighting groups; one is proclaiming that this perfomance is a form of modern art aimed to express the political protest, and another group is sure that the punk pray is nothing but only an attempt to hurt the feelings off religious people and descrinate the faith. However, freedom of people to express their own is a constitutionally proclaimed right of everyone so no one can be deprived of it. More to say, throughout the centuries all the artists (musicians, painters, poets) have struggled for their freedom to be heard.
Therefore, it seems to me like it is not the government who can somehow restrict the artists' freedom to express themselves. The only rules that can somehow be excercised must be created only by the common will of society, so these rules will become some moral orientiers for artists in order to make it more easy to distinguish where the expression of themselves can hurt anyone else.

While it may be true that the number of crimes increases, but the significance decreases.
Nevertheless, it still remains a problem for society if youngers tend not to follow the the rules. In my opinion, unsufficient attention is the cause of it. First of all, parents should spend more time with children even if they are usually busy at work. A child need someone who he or she will perceive as an example of good behavior. It is great if he or she has one and it means a child will copy good behavior and get knowledge about ethics.
But there is a significant drawback in this point of view. What if parents work all week and simply do not have a lot of spare time for children? Because of that teachers in schools should also take responsibility for children in their classes. But it also require teachers to have high moral standarts.
Both parents and teachers should teach children how to be responsible. It means that they should understand that every action has consequences. It means parent and teachers should pay attention to the successes but at the same time they shoulde strick if a child did something bad. In this situation they would motivate children to be better and prevent them from bad behaviour.
I believe that behaviour of young people depends on how they grew up. And that is the reason I think that parents and teachers are able to influence teens and it is the most sufficient way to struggle with increasing number of crimes committed by young people.

In 2000 about 20 mln of south Asian girls could not get education and it was approximately two times as many as boys were but there has happened a great change by 2012 and their total amount decreased and was less than 10 millions of children. As for rest of world, index also was not stable and showed a tendecy to lower the amount of boys and girls without education-supply.

In 1750 there were less than one million of people in USA. During next fifty years, the number of people increased slightly, but still remained on approximately same level. Till 1800 the birth rate exceeded the death rate on same level. In 1800 the level of birth declined slightly, while the level of death dropped dramatically. The population reached 25 million in 1850, when the difference between birth rate and death rate was the most remarkable. This year was followed by a sudden grow of population, there already were 80 millions of people in 1900. This year birth rate still declined, but death rate started to fluctuate. In the first half of 20th century the population surged by 150 million. For next fifty years the level of birth bounced back, the number changed remarkably and reached its peak in 2000 with approximately 300 million.

However, such people as musicians and film producers can ever suffer from them, because they help some people to spread their material illegally. Some people think that it is a big issue, whereas others do not. In my essay I will give arguments for and against piracy followed by a reasoned conclusion.
Someone thinks that piracy cannot be tolerated in some cases. First of all, money from the product’s sales can be important source of gained profit for its creator. So, when people download or copy his product, a creator loses a lot of money which he gained with his own efforts. Moreover, this situation can make creators unintersted in making new projects in future, because it decreases their motivation and spur.
However, there are people, who accept the situation with illegal pirate copies. To begin with, these products can be overpriced in some countries and consumers cannot simply afford it. It is especially related to computer software. What is more, nowadays people do not want to pay for things that are not worth it. However, in case with such products as films or music, consumers cannot tell whether it is good or bad until they listen to music or watch that film.
As for me, I suppose that in the future we cannot escape the piracy, because it is uncontrolable process and governments can do nothing with it. Nevertheless producers may continue to gain profits if their products are worth it, because consumers that have enjoyed a product even in illegal way can praise the producer with money after all.
To sum up, I would like to say that people should be taught about consumers culture at schools, universities and other peaces, because it seem to be the only one way to praise producers under this circumstances.

Thst’s why coping in sharing music or films is illegal. People who do this should be punished by the law. So, let’s try to discuss.

Many people often use the Internet for free downloading films, books, music and anything else. On the one hand it can brings many loses for authors and producers, because no one wants to buy albums on discs or in special resources (for example, like “Apple music for Iphones, Ipads, etc). the law cant minimize this, because it’s so hard to control people from all over the world.And it’s also not easy to stop the illegal discs sellers, because they do their affairs among the “dark selling web”. Of course, this people should be punished.

On the other hand, musician producers and film directors can also earn the money from concerts or cinematheatres. The biggest part of money they have are going from albums of filmses first representation. And I we talk about big films, they can be payded by the gouverment.

So, to conclude, it’s clear, that there no single meaning in this issue. But to my mind, Very hard unillegal law politic is wrong too. The most part of musicians are really don’t care about illegal salers. They understand the real meaning of the Freedom of the information in 21 century. But I also think, that using some special programmes for legal downloading can be compromise decision for this two sides. may be in the nearest future this big problem will be solved.

Now everybody can esealy sitting at home in front of a laptop and watch any movie he wants and will not pay even 1 cent. And a lot of people believe that such illegal activity should be punished as other crimes. As for me, I absolutely agree with this position because of some reasons.
First of all, thefts of such type in first order suffer people who are responsible for all these movies and music that people enjoy every minute. They make their own work as all other people including politics and policy and therefore they have to get their salary. If something is theft it is always crime. So why rules for thefts of this type should be another? Moreover, copying and sharing programmes, music and films is prohibited by the law. It is obvious that people who do this dirty work are need to be found and punished.
By the way, there is another point of view. Everybody loves watch films and listen to the music as it makes people happy in dayly routine and sometimes even give power to do another step. Nevertheless, not all of them can get it because of low income. So, copies in the Internet is the only way to touch this. Another people live in such special areas. Where modern foreign film industry, for example, is prohibited by the goverment as in some east countries.
To sum up, it is evident that such copying of information is illegal activity as people who produce all this music and films have great harm.

Undoubtedly, the main part of this product made by British and United Kingdom of America. It goes without saying that it is enough popular amoung teenagers and adults people. I will try to explain why.
Firstly, the modern films fits the requirement of population. People need more expression and bright emotions. Therefore, the cinema give them such product as action movies, horrors and drama. Moreover, the ideas and conception about arts has changed. In modern world people have an aspiration to self-develop and a lot of talent and creativity. So they make the masterpieces which others people like because they also have this pursuit. Secondly, British and USA have the rich money source. Therefore, films of these countries significally better than products of other countries. Such films as British and Usa films have the great quality. It consists the grafics, actors, montage and etc. So it is the one of the important reason why many people to prefer foreign films rather than locally produced films. In addition, the huge sums of money spend on the design and marceting in order to attract people in cinema. Therefore, people see the beautiful posters, buy the tickets and go to the cinema.
I strongly agree with the idea that governments should more financial support to own films. However, in my opinion, this support should be strict, because a lot of unquality and full films are displayed at the cinema, while the useful and quality films have not famous. I consider that is unfair. Actually, the cinematograph is the part of national culture. Therefore, the culture advancement leads to average well-being of population. Also film industries has an influence on international relationship. So I have the standpoint that goverments should participate in financial support to local film industries.",60,2,1

Some people believe that such travelling harms the ecosystem, others argue that it is imperative that air travelling remains the same and I can understand their point of view. First of all, air travelling is the most efficient way to travel ling distance with the minimum amount of emission into the atmosphere and maximum number of passengers transported. If governments can air travelling or introducing a tax that will make flying unaffordable, people will search other means to travel, which may turn out to be more dangerous to our planet, for example, more cars will be used thus increasing the amount of carbon monoxide in the air. What is more, sometimes air travelling is the only way to get to a specific location, for example, spizbergen or other islands it will take ages to get from spizbergen to main land via ship travelling, non with starding that some ships are not meant to be sailing in cold water icebergs. Moreover, Rescue Teams also use aircraft to quickly transport injured people to the emergency rooms in hospitals or to help firefighters conquer the forest fires. Despite all these fact, some people strongly believe that governments should take action and deal with the amount of air travels in order to protect the environment. Some argue that if you want to travel for pleasure or business you should pay more. It seems that higher prices will commute the damage to the environment. They also think that people will remain within their social areas or their own country and that that with the higher payments less people will travel worldwide. It goes without saying that while some part of this argument is true it is doubtful that air travel will be reduced dramatically, while it is obvious that other means of transport such as cars or trains will be used more, as the result more energy will be consumed and more harmful goes will be thrown in the air. All in all, the issue of restricting air travelling still needs to be thoroughly considered, but I believe that restricting air travelling is not a wise move as it may turn out to be counter productive and consequently, lead to negative results.

One people think that a large bisnesses replace local, but others don't believe in this.
In my view benefits of caurse outwaigt the disadvantages. Firsly, a big buiseness is always good. We live in a huge city whith the great number of population and we need to live with comfortable.For example, nowadays we have a lot of supermarkets, big shops and it made our shopping more comfortable. We can find all things or products that we need in one place and dont waste our time.
In favour of this statement is that in big places there were a lot of parkings places for people with cars or a lot of entertaiment places for children. Perents always can leave their children there and go to shopping.
The argument against big buisnesses is that local bisnesses have a lot of benifits. For example small buisnedd such as a small shop on the street have not a lot of people and if you need you can go there and buy what you need very quickly and save your time.Usually in such shops the products are more fresh. It is very grate for our health. To sum up, I want to say that as a proverb goes ""How many people, so many minds"". I think that small buisness is good, but big is better. We need to depend our cities, contries and today we have a great opportunity to do it.",65,2,2

As it may be conluded from the chart all regions have a decline in the rates of number of children without access to primary education. Africa shows leading position, the number of children with no access hits the pick of 43,7 millions people in 2000. South Asia is at the same level of numeracy in 2000 as Africa is in 2012. The situation of primary education access is much better in the rest of the world (in 2012 the number is half less then in Africa). From 2000 to 2012 the situation rapidly changes in South Africa. As it may be seeing from the graph the number of boys and girls with access to education in 2012 in that region is way less then in the rest of the world the same year.


In conclusion more children have chance to have a primary education in 2012 than in 2000. But it is a well-recognized dinamic that girls have less opportunities for education all over the world.

So, what should be done to reduce crime? For me, personally, i think the best way to get rid of crimes is to invent very strict laws and punishments, which you know you could not break or escape.
Many people believe that by giving longer prison sentences we will reduce crime. I can partly agree with this statement. Firstly, longer prison sentences may cause the fear of staing in prison forever. It is scary to know that you are stuck in the same space for a long amount of time, unable to do things you like. Also, the lac of privacy for many people could be dramatising. Secondly, by extanding the amount of time in prison, you give criminals time to think about what they have done and it gives them a chance to change the way they see the world around and even to change themselves. But does it work like that for evereone?
That is why other people suggest different way of reducing crime. Other then punishments and fines, it would be great if our government would provide jobs for people who was realised out of prison, because for those people it is very hard to start a normal life, to get a job, so they could break the law again in order to get money for food and clothes.Increasing the amount of money you pay as a fine is anouther way ti reduce crime. I think that not so many people would be able to offord to pay thousands of money to keep out of prison, so they would think twice before commiting a crime. Also, more strict punishments would be essentual. If people know what they are going to face if they break the law and if they know that the would not be able to escape it, they definately would not even think about commiting a crime.
All in all, i think that stric laws and punushments are essantial to make a healthy society and providing ex prisoners a job could be benefituak not only for them, but also for the gouvernement",70,2,2

I firmly believe, that moving business to another country may have more positive affection, than negative, especially when this places are in poverty. The causes of such changes influence not only the company itself, but also the country, that was chosen to become a new place of the business. The value of having an opportunity to become an employee of an international business company is rather high, because people can obtain new knowledges and skill, which they haven’t got a chance to get before. Also, poor countries as a rule represent a problem of employment and many people can’t find a job. By the employment of local workers international companies may help people not to face this problem and more. Furthermore, such possibilities that country and it’s nationality obtain can help to get out from poverty and to uplift it’s status. However, there are also some disadvantages than can have a negative impact on the country. The main one is, that companies of the country where business was settled may face misses of workers, that can be retired on their desire because they may want to work in a new company. It can cause significant conflicts between them, that can influence the country dramatically. At the same time this new company can not have interest in this country because of its specific characteristics. For example company that sell ice is unnecessary in Arctica. However, I still think, that advantages of moving the business of th international company to poorer countries outweigh all the disadvantages, because, to my mind, poor countries need help of will-developed ones to reduce its poverty and such cases can have a positive affection on the whole development of the country.

Some people believe that environmental issues and poverty are more important, but is it really so?
Well, I personally believe that the space expeditions and researches are not standing in the way of solving everyday problems of the society.
It is common knowledge that governments of such states that have space programs often do a lot of expences on building spacecrafts and supporting space researching scientists. But these countries usually have a budget that can offord both space industry and spending money on helping to solve such problems like the environmental polutions or coalas extinction.
Moreover, the important thing is that not only states' governments do space explorations. There are individual companies that are specialised on evolving what people know about the outer space. One of these companies is SpaceX developed by Elon Mask. This company have done dosens of experiments on landing a space rocket and has plans to make Mars a place where people can live. This fact proves that people can do the science without the help of the state, which saves governments money to deal with other urgent problems.
All in all, most people believe that it is useful to learn about how universe works or just explore new worlds, but all of these things can give humanity a chance to find other races or resources that can not be found on Earth.

One of these issues is pollutions and global warming by air travel. Some people think that the authorities should improve this situation by reducing air travels. I absolutely disagree with this decision and I will try to explain why. First and foremost, air travel is not the only one thing which pollutes our environment. There are such issues as pollutions by factories, cars, cutting off the trees, etc. One of the perfect ways to decrease air pollutions is to create or find a new energy resource, technology, which can replace things providing bad conditions to the environment. In addition, reducing the amount of flights is connected to the consfictuonal right of people. It is all about the freedon of the movement. People have possibility to travel by air and they always should have possibility to use their right. The last but not least, if government reduce the amount of air travel, people will have to use other ways of travelling. For instance, travelling by sea also contributes to water pollutions, as other transport does. To take into account, I would like to emphisize, that the authorities should not to strict people rights. The are a lot of ways to cut off pollutions by finding alternative energy sources and improving engineering technologies.

In this essay I will discuss why do I think that some laws should be introduced to decrease the number of flights that are not necessary for humanity, as they pollute the environment.

I absolutely agree that the government should make some changes and delite flights that are just for leisure or gave business goals. I am inconvinced that lots of people use plaines when they can travel or transport their products by train, which is more ecological friendly type of transport. I believe that the government should tax lots of flights because there are a lot of plains that are flying with just two or three passengers inside. All plains should be full of passengers while others delighted.

I think that if some air travelers whant have to pay taxes, the number of people who whant to travel will reduce. Although air travel is much faster than other types of transport, it pollute air and can cause different natural disasters in the future. Statistic shows that in s per day was limited in 2012, the air by now become much more pure than before this law have been introduced.

However, all these issues can be solved. Less time should be spent in front of the computer, business discussion can be conducted in person instead of Skype conferences. People should walk more, do sports in order to avoid obesity. Moreover, influence of modern movies, stresses connected with reusing of a computer must be reduced by natural communication with natural people and healthy eating. This will bring nerves into good condition. Lastly, parents should care about their and future children's health and avoid radiation, X-rays and so on.

Then just these figured grew slightly and in approximately seven years reached the points of 20 millions and near 12 millions respectively. After that there was a significant growth in the number of visits abroad by UK residents and by the end of the shown period in 1999 this figure stayed at the point of more than 50 millions visits.

The bigger part of them are going to attend a university for higher education. In addition to the first fact, there should be mentioned that the population of women is bigger than men in general. Of course, there may be some exceptions , but they are not so relevant that it may become possible to ignore this fact. Thirdly, I would like to underline a widespread argument that all people are individuals and only a person can disclose his skills and abilities. Additionally, no one can decide  what should people do or not do. Fourthly, an ability to participate in this or that studying activity does not depend on the gender. Some girls are more psychologically prepared for men's kinds of jobs. Moreover, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can be classified as a gender discrimination which is restricted in modern law society.
On the other hand, there are some factors that can make people think of this need of such selection of students like bigger popularity of humanitarian courses than technical ones. There is a way of solution of such a problem . It would be better to state a strict number of students in general , but not according to their sex.

You can hardly disagree that it is very important to be happy but when you ask people how it is to be happy and what they need to be happy, you may soon understand that everybody put their own meaning in the word ""happy"".

At the same time you can also find the main factors wich make people be happy. First of all, everybody wants to deal with stress. It's simply to understand - of you don't want to have any problems with your school or work. There are some people who want to be rich or just have a little more money than they have now. The other want a good health. But just ask yourselves, is it the real happiness?

According to the data, both male and female users consider sharing photos and videos to be an important reason to use Facebook, but women found it somewhat more important.

There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extend to you agree or disagree with this opinion?
It goes without saying that artists are people who need a lot of freedom in all ways for the possibility to create something. This means that they are sure that any restriction of their way of life will influence their inspiration and will spoil their work. In which degree should the government restrict creative artists? Let's think about it.
To my mind, the government shouldn't limit the activity of artists. It is out of the questions, that artists are those people who can change the history and the culture. One generation change into another but the art is saving from the earliest centuries to nowadays. It demonstrate that artists should be respectable in society, they should have a lot of advantages, because they are unusual people. This means that the government also shouldn't influence the artists' way of life in such way as ideological restrictions.
On the other hand, artists are also the citizens of a concrete country. It is clear that they as everyone in this government should have some political duties like taxing and so on. In this way, in my opinion, creative artists of course should have government restrictions.
Thus, I would like to say, that artists are very important people in the world, they play a very significant role, but it's not the reason not to restrict them as other citizens.

I am disagree with this statement and I will try to explain why. 

First of all, there are some countries in the world which can not produce as much food as it is population needs. SO other countries can help such countries and it’s people to survive by import some food to them. Also some countries have not got a special aquipment for producing any type of doof or in this region some species of plants cannot grow or kind of anymals cannot live. But this countryes can produce other type of resources. So countries can excnenge thir goods, or sell some products, with they have to earn money and buy food or something else from another country.  Secondly, if country can produce more food than it’s population can eat, souch country will be able to sell a part of food which they don’t need to earn some money and improve the live of population of this country or it can solve some problems which this county has (for example problems with bad roads). 

In conclusion, I can say that it is really necessary for all of us and for all countries to help each other with food. That is why countries, which can produce more food than they need, should do that and give or sell this food to other countries.

One category of society argues that such kind of pirates must be punished or even prisoned. Another group of people claimes that all individuals must get free access to all music clips, music compositions and films.
Without doubts former position is good argumented one. People who download files with music and new film from internet without paying money, just do not respect individuals who created all this stuff. We all have person whos works we admire, can be producer or musician or actor. We all should understand that this person put his soul and heart into his creations. Moreover, the work of producer or musician is also a labour, a hard labour, and this hard labour must be paid. The wage of musician is the amount of money he got from selling his music.
On the other hand many popstars as well as producers and musicians have a strong belief that people should have free access to they music and film. They told that if their music of films are really good people will buy disc with it. Indeed, this point of view seems to be widespread today. Many people pay for access to online cinema platforms or music online clouds like Itunes. As the advantage they get best conditions of watching films and sound characteristics. Futhemore, people prefer to go to the cinema to watch film if they know that film become the winner of the festival, it means that the firm is really worth and they want to spend they money on tickets or discs to watch it in perfect conditions in cinema.
My point of view more closer to the second one, despite the arguments of the first group of people. I strongly believe that it is not relevant solution to give people free access to all pieces of music and films but the government don’t have to punish people strictly for downloading files with music and films.

It is clear that the year temperatures rates in Brazil remained above zero degrees in the contrast to the same temperature numbers in Russia due to the climate differences in two semispheres.

On the one hand it is great idea about similar rules for all students without looking at theirs gender, but I disagree with it. Because different proportion of women and men in technical or humanitarian departments depends on phisycal criteria.

On the other hand, as I said before, to prepearing this idea being some reasons. One of them is phisycal differences between two genders. Many people know that male students prefer technical and math way, while the majority part of female students choose humanitarian subjects. So, basing at this knowldge, it will trully to said idea about equal numbers of man and woman students is unrealistic. But if universities will rescreate their study system, following this idea, might been problem. For example, for math and physycal classes vacancy for men will full, but for women it will always be enough. While other men, who would want to study at this university will have needness to search another university, where vacancies will open.

In conclusion, I would like to repeate sometimes educauional system being need changings, but all of these ideas should examined for reality. Because tries to accept similar numbers of male and female students it is good change for making base of democraty, but it is not best area of changing for this.

I believe that there are to sides to the problem and both are somehow connected to emergence and development of new technologies.

This contributes directly to the increase of crime rates - young people, who are good at dealing with all these new Information technologies, are given a new instruments for commiting crime - when they have started to use actively. On the other hand, due to new technologies work market has become more competitive, a lot of simple tasks are now done by computers, so those low-qualified youngsters find it harder to get a job now. This causes them to search for alternative ways of making money and, thus, turning to black market. Moreover, job search is accompanied by higher stress levels, so youngsters become more impulsive and aggresive - when makes them more likely to commit a crime like punching someone or even killing someone. 
Surely, if the causes are identified, some ways of improving the situation can be found. First of all, as life has become harder for young people, support and love get very important to help them maintain their emotional calmness. Therefore, parents should pay more attention to their kids and explain to them that, though, life is more stressful now, they still have someone to rely on. Then, of course, since childhood young people should be shown that crimes commited wit the use of the Internet are not anonymous as it may seem first and, therefore, lead to legal concequences and should be seen by children as crimes just as real and terrible as murder. Then, some changes to the job market should be introduced - the free courses for those young people who want to find work. But this is the task of the government, rather than of parents and teachers.
To sum up, I would like to say that the problem of the increasing numbers of youngsters being involved in crimes is very important and should be dealed with actively. Parents and teachers with love, support and education can make a tremendous step on the way to the solution of the problem and if participated by the government - can be really effective in decreasing crime rates among youngsters.

On the other hand, the lowest level of unemployment. On the other hand, the lowest level of unemployment can be seen in Asia, with an absolute meaning of 3,9 per cent. The rates in those two regions have not changed in a period between 2014 and 2015, however we can see a diminishing tendency in the other world regions.
For example, the rate of unemployed people went down in both Latin America and Middle East mainly because the living standards of these regions were increased over the past years.

Some others think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view.
On the one hand, there is no doubt that using illegal drugs to boost you physical abbilities and improve your scores on competition is dishonest, unethical and unsportive. Such athletes distort people imagination about professional sport and consequently decrease people interest to them. From this point of view I can agree with those who think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. Another supportive argument, that banning athletes for the rest of their lives we can ensure that those people will stop using druggs. It will cause a decrease of drug expansion between athletes, and it will improove their health condition.
On the other hand, everybody makes mistakes. We can imagine that athlete in his seek to achievements, ready to try everything to increase his abbilities. In that case, using illegal drugs is the easiest way to achieve your goals. The best way to eliminate athlete's hesitations: to use drugs, or not to use, is a limited time bann. Using this solution for the problem of illegal drugs using, we can ensure that after athletes return to professional competitions, he will never try to improve his skills by using drugs.
In conclusion we can state, that illegal drugs are absolutely un acceptable in professional sport, and athlets caught using this drugs should be banned, but the period of their bann should depends on the situation.

There are some reasons of this problem, and various measured can be taken to improve the situation.

It is widely known that there are a lot of various examples of negative influence of modern technologies on human health. One of those negative influence often related with eyes of peoples who have to spend all day long in front of the computer screen. In this case, such people have not only a headaches but also problems with their eyes, like a loosing theirs sight. For instance, a huge amount of people nowdays have to wear glaces because of bad sight, which is deteriorate by modern technologies. Moreover, there is other problem connected with ears. Most of young people preferred to listen music to loud, that can damage they hearing.

The best way to solve this problem is to be more responsible to your own health. People all over the world should take some measures to decrease influence of gadgets and modern technologies on their health by using high quality screens and monitors and doing some breaks in the middle of working process. Another point that can help people to save their health is nessesaty of listening music not so loud. Government also can help by not allowing to listen music very loud. To exemplify, in Moscow is denied to listen music very loud in residential area, and it can save ears of people who live in this place.

To conclude, there are some ways that can help tacle this problem, and people should use it to make their everyday life comfortable and healthy.

In this essay possible causes and solutions will be described.
The first reason for this could be that, unfortunately, nowadays we have a lot of movies and computer games where people misbehave and do wrong things. I am sure that this fact influences children's mind and make them to break law. For example, last year there was an accident with a boy who killed his father and as it was known after, he did it only because he saw it in a movie. Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. Adults, especially teachers and parents, should look carefully after their children's way of entertaining: what they watch, what games they play etc.
The following cause for this is domestic violence. It is not a secret that nowadays much more families start to beat their ""lovely"" children. After that kids become more violence and cruel. For this situation everything depends on parents, so the solution is warm and grateful relationships among the family members. Moreover, I think that teachers at schools should also give lessons on the topic about behavior in the family and society on the whole. For instance, in my school we had such lessons where we could watch some social advertisements about violent children and their awful and even scaring families and it influenced our minds, we did not want to become as they were.
To sum up, I would like to say that children's behavior is exactly depends on adults and what measures they take.",60,2,0

It is the important part of economy of a lot of countries. It would be deteriorated, if import stopped. This process gives a lot of money to governments of countries that they can spend for improving a quality of life of their population. That’s why I disagree with this statement.

In my personal opinion culture and art is certainly an inceporable peace of our everyday life. So those who create genuine art are [ir?]tal for the soeciety to develope in the right direction. Though, creative artists are obviously should feel free to express themself in all ways of art like literature, cinema, painting etc., they still should have some moral boundaries, not necessary provided by government. I do believe that everyone should know the difference between expressing themselves and total limitless egoism. Especially when those artist want the audience to see or to hear their masterpience. What I mean is art can not be associated with insulting others, making harm to others even if the Creator suppose it is how He sees the world. For example, a famous singer is writing a rude song about his enemy or a person he just dislikes. As soon as the people hear this song, they will have prejudices against this person without even knowing him/her.
Moreover, sometimes so-called art can have some inappropriate content, it can be inappropriate for children, for instance. This is when the government can interfere and put some age restrictions.
All in all, I understand that artist are free spirits, though I still stick to the idea that the genuine (which is very important) art and the rules of morality and tolerance should compromise in order to prevent chaos and misunderstanding.

I partly agree with this statement. To my mind government can not restric art except two cases. The first one is provided by the typoes of art,  which are potentially dangerous for society, and the second one - by the pieces of art done unprofessionaly and witout any cultural function. 
The good example of both the confrontation and the partnership between art and government is street art. Every day a large number of graffities occur through the cities all over the world. Most of them are placed in publick spots or on the walls of houses and cover buses or trains, which is forbidden by city rules. On the on hand several pieces of street art are really fascinating and don'tbring any damage to city. But the rest of them, on the other hand, are awful and don't fit cultural norma, accepted in society.

From biological point of view, genes play the most important role in the process of formation of a person, while sociologists and psychologists believe that environment and life experience have greater influence than any genetic characteristics. I tend to support the sociologist's pointview, and below I am going to give arguments for that.
To begin with, it worths mentioning that in the second half of the 20th century there was a great interest in this question and some important studies were conducted. Researchers found twins who were separated in their childhood and growned up in very different social environment. What did they found is that social factors such as some characteristics of neighbourhood, parent's jobs, and early life experience had greater influence on later life than any biological factors. Even though the difference in their impact wasn't considerable, it indicates that with equal set of genes people's future depends on their socialisation process.
Looking deeper into process of socialisation, it could be stated that some ""life shocks"" in early childhood had a significant impact on person's personality. These life shocks include death of a relative, poverty, the lose of a house or bancropcy of a parent, and more others. After facing one or more of these circumstances, child might find herself or himself in a changing and unfamiliar environment. This, in turn, could provoke major changes in his or her personality. Since the nature of the ""life shocks"" is social and noone is secured from them, we can conclude that social component is very important to the process of the develompent of the individual.
Therefore, I reckon that environment is more important then genes, since even slight change in it could be followed by a great change in one'a personality.

Unfortunately, today we can really witness that people suffer from different problems connected with heath. For example, a lot of people have bad eyesight due to using phones and watching TV very often. Another problem which is more dangerous and serious is that there is information overload in our modern world. Because of a lot of messages, phone calls and information people have stress and depression, which lead to nervous breaks.
It goes without saying that some measures should be taken. From my point of view the only way to solve these problems is to reduce time which we spend using our telephones, computers and not waste time sitting near the television set. A wonderful solution is to have active way of life. For example, people need to go out and go for a walk more often, to do sports, fitness exercises. We should communicate with our friends and relatives in real life, and not by using social nets. Finally, another way to reduce time we waste on modern technology is to search information, write essays and study by going to the library but not searching the Internet.
In conclusion I would like to emphasize that the widespread use of modern technology can lead to essential consequances connected with problems with our health like bad eyesight, nervous breaks.

Creative artists now are free to express themselves in different kind of art and government should not create any restrictions and obstacles to this process. In my opinion, that trend seems to be right and obvious. 
Firstly, artists creativity of all kinds is a part of great culture of their homeland. Every expressed idea makes its own donate to culture, so government should support that natural culture development, bot not make different kinds of restrictions. Secondly, products of creative artists such as pictures, music, films and others inspire ordinairy people in their fights with everyday problems. It is a great source of support and inspiration power, which helps everyone to refresh their spirits in hard times. 
Other people have different point of view. It is believed that modern art is aimed mostly on sexual and violence themes and it can be harmful for people who are easy to impress and the only way to defend them from that kind of art is the following government should provide special laws to restrict the freedom in free spreading of that kind of art. 
To sum up, the developement of art sphere with expressing ideas by creative should be held in natural atmosphere but it is necessary for government to shield children and sensitive people from sexual and violent content.

Others think that there are other ways to do this. He first way is very useful because criminals will be longer disconnected from society. So they will not have any opportunities to commit crimes. Also, if there is more hard punishment for crime, more people will prefer to live in low. For example, growing of fees for corruption of transportation rules decreases. Number of accident so it can be expected to work same for other crimes. On the other hand, increase of prison sentences has a lot of disadvantages. First of all, it can increase cost of judgment mistake. If somebody was “entombed” in jail for very longtime, he will suffer from some mental problems, loose his social skills and it can force him to be come more dangerous criminal. In addition, longer punishment more expensive. When somebody kept in prison, he doesn’t do any useful work. So first way can be very hard to our economy. Alter native ways to reduce crime can solve this problems. For example, some lawbreaks can be punished by home arrest. This is more cheaper and less destructive for him. Also, government can prevent crimes by removing reasons of crime. It is no surprising, that most of criminals break the law because they do not have other choices. Most of them do not have good education. This cause their unemployment so they start to search some illegal job like robbering or drug selling. If the government take actions against unemployment, level of crimes will be reduced automatically. Also, there is very good opportunity to make some activities legal. For example, legalizing of drugselling makes a lot of criminal businesses economically unprofitable so number of crimes go down. In my opinion. Using of alter native solution of criminal problem is better because it is less harmful for prisoners. In addition, it is better in economical terms because citizens do not need to feed a lot of people on restraint.

Even more dangerous is the alarming tendency of rising youth crime cases. This might stand for growing anxiety in the society and law’s - respect by non-adults. As possible effects of this trend I can mention social unstability and lack of intellegent human resourses in future. Though there are people, who should guide their children and in order to prevent catastrophic damages to the humanity in terms of dangerous coming generations.
To eliminate the problem and stop this unhealthy crime wave, we must find out reasons for it. In my opinion there are two main causes: historical and psychological. A century ago, people of my age have been working full time for 5 years. The usage of children’s hands in manufacturing, farms had been widely spread unlike education and equal rights: prosperious families could afford to send their kids to schools while carpenter’s children began to work from very young age. Nowadays the situation has changed and young people do not have to earn money since they are physically ready to. Thus, more freedom resulted in less control and young people began to use their time for commiting crimes also. Being supported by families and sometimes by the government, kids feel protected and might look for some interesting activities besides school, which is a psychological reason for them to do something illegal.
Crime is an action of disobeyment and representation of person’s disagreement with given rules or his life circumstances. In teenager’s souls rebelious thoughts are growing. If not carefully guided, their flame and energy will go away and burn everything down. So, parents and teachers as main advisors should take care of young people. They must create a comfortable environment and atmosphere of love to make them feel good. Relationships in family are the most important thing determing young’s beheviour in future, so parents shoud behave respectfully to their child thoughs and personality as well as teachers.
To conclude, young crimes are upsurging, which is a problem leading to serious negative effects on the society. Because of freedom spreading teenagers began to feel allmighty and do everything they want. To prevent this behavior parents and teachers should do everything to contact with children in a good and tolerant way.

This essay will, firstly, attempt at analysing the causes of this significant issue, and secondly, possible solutions will be provided.

It cannot be denied that the problem of increasing numbers of crimes that are commited by young people is complex and has several underlying causes. Firstly, kids and youngsters are exposed to violence and criminal behavior from a young age. That is due to the fact that these aspects of human life are shown vividly in countless films, TV programmes, news and videogames. This provides children with a distorted image of how a civilized human should behave, and violence along with crimes become a norm for kids. Secondly, a lot of youngsters commit petty crimes such as shoplifting as they do not have enough activities to do outside school or university. It can be seen that not every town has sport clubs, playground, parks or other places to spend time at. This causes people to become members of suspicious group that may turn out to be criminal ones. Finally, young people do not always have appropriate job opportunities to earn for their living and to become ordinary citizens. According to the statistics, provided that a school or a university graduate becomes jobless, he or she is more likely to commit crimes during the unemployment period.

However, several feasible solutions can be considered and put into practice to help reduce the amount of crimes commited by teenagers. To start with, governments should restrict TV and game content according to the age when these products can be cunsumed safely. It would be a useful idea for parents to follow this age rates and control what their children are exposed to. This will prevent kids from an early exposure to crimes. What is more, we should organise enough interest clubs, gyms, swimming pools so that young people have a variety of outschool activities to choose from. In such way they will not be prone to committing crimes. Besides, youngsters should receive advise and help to get a job. For this purpose, vacancy fairs and workshops can be organised. Also young professionals may be offered additional perks or bonuses at work so they are more motivated to retain their workplace.

To conclude, having taken into account the causes of the problem of rising crime rates among young adults and feasible solutions, it is clear that there is a lot to be undertaken to prevent youngsters from committing crimes. The main thing to be remembered is that we all should be commited to this issue and put all the effort to solve it. It is expected that, if these recommendations are taken into consideration, the amount of young criminals will decrease in the upcoming years.",65,2,0

It is difficult for everyone to imagine the sky with no plane, to go on a long trips and voyages only by train and car as these vehicles seem us too slowly now. Despite air transport is really useful, it produces poisonous emissions in the air and contributes to global warming.
To my mind, it would be great if our government create some laws to reduce air pollutions. It is obvious that the problem of pollution is connected with an enormous amount of different kinds of transport. Actually, this issue is caused not only by air transport. In such cities like Moscow the biggest part of these emissions is produced by private and public transport that everyone use everyday. Cars, taxis and some buses damage our atmosphere much more stronger than planes and helicopters. It is quite complicated for government to introduce a law which can safe our air from pollutions and maintane an atmosphere clean. For instance, nowadays there is a quick development of vehicles that work from electricity or from alternative energy resources, but not everyone will change their own comfortable transport on such electricity cars as they are quite expensive and difficult to charge (in Moscow there is no special stations for charging electric transport).
However, it is thought that air travels are more harmful due to huge sizes of engines of air transport. Planes or helicopters need much more petrol than those vehicles we use on the ground. Consequently, they through out a lot of emissions in our atmosphere, more than public and private transport. This opinion is quite faire.
Overall,I believe that our governments should not concentrate only on changing out transport, but also on the people's upbringing. Probably if we start to tell children about serious problems of ecology, of air pollution and global warming, we could influence their minds and make them to carry our atmosphere. May be in 20 years we all start to use bicyles instead of cars and taxis, or we will try to get our destinations on foot, not by buses. And of course, the pollution caused by air transport will reduce.",70,2,2

But in March 2013 the trend changed due to an increasing of number of users who used the mobile version of Facebook. As can be seen from the graph, the number of mobile users accounts for well over 80 million. Besides in March 2013 desktops began to loose their positions in platform share of using the social network. The number of desktop users accounts for just under 140 million so it could be argued that the desktop platform lost their domination. The second bar chart reports about the reasons for using Facebook and the gender differences between purpose of using the social network. At the first glance, it could be seen that women share more photos and videos than men so that’s why that the majority of users who considers sharing media content is women.

In constrast to this, 43% of female users consider seeing funny posts the main purpose to the social networks whereas only 35% of male users think so.

However, the punishment for using them is still a matter of arguement for many people. Some people believe that a limited period of disqualification is enough, while others insist on banning guilty sportsmen and sportswomen for life.
First of all, I would like to draw attention to the differences of these lists of forbidden drugs in different countries. This matters in the world of international championships and competitions. As long as there is no mutual agreement there is no point in searching for a fair punishment. In this case there will not take place any international scandal like the one with Russian athletes year ago.
Secondly, there are different amounts of drugs taken and various situations. I suppose every athlete should be judged individually. In this case a limited period of banning and banning for the rest of one's career might be just two possible scenarios, so both sides of the argument could be satisfied.
On the other hand, illegal drugs not only make the competitions unfair but also harm athletes' health. Considering this point it might be proper to have strict laws and punishment for the usage of them in order to prevent others from taking these drugs. Although banning professionals for life doesn't seem to be correct and effective.
Taking into consideration each argument mentioned above, it occurs to me that both sides offer different solutions both which could be used in one fair system. I assume that each case deserves to be analysed separately, nevertheless it does not mean that the punishment for using illegal drugs should not be strict.

Let’s look at the first social network – Facebook. This one is mostly used by members of the youngest age group (87%). Then we can see that people from the oldest age group like it less than ones from the other age groups. But the percentage use of different groups doesn’t have big gaps – every group has only about 10% difference with its neighbours.
For Instagram there is another situation. This social network is popular only among members of the youngest group (more than 50%), other people don’t like this network – less than 25% use it. in each group. LinkedIn is a network for adults. It is the only one which is not used mostly by the youngest group. It is loved by 30 – 49 and 50 – 64 groups.

Person who always takes mobile phone in his pocket has a risk to get cancer and some other dangerous desiases when he will be old. Another ond the most obvious example of bad impact of modern technologies is fact that more than half of the population of the World have to wear glasses to improue their vision abilities. It happened because a lot of people spend their free time using computers and watching TV. Because of these reasons eyes lose its abiity to see uery good on long distances.

We have a lot of wars, we came from agriculture type to manufacturing, moreover no one countries don’t think globally for big aim of safe our Earth, espescially in long term. We continue to build up new factories, manufactures, develop new army vehicle, also airplanes. Even in nowadays, we don’t use separate rubbish, don’t moves by bycicles, don’t use social transport, we just buy new cars and poor petrol inside.
On the other side, we may notice that some commercial enterprises, like Tesla or Space X, who work on supporting our Earth, with help of electrocars and shuttles, which not damage air and atmosphere. Also, such project like 'tube', which will use magnet tube for movements be westside in U.S. without pollution.
Nevertheless, World has some examples, that government are thinking about pollution. Some countries try to come from usuall resources to alternative. For instance, Denmark use energy of wind almost for whole country. Iceland use power of waves and use it in 50%. 
All this arguments lead to air travel not a main problem. We must look on problem with a highest point. Whole world must change. Even if air travel is a part of main aim, indeed we could change with another actions to protect Earth. Today, we use patrol for cars in 95% of cases. Although, could use an electricity.

Do we have to support our local film industries and deny foreign film production? In my opinion, we do not have to do all this.
It is not a secret that western companies spend more money on film producing to invite Hollywood stars such as Bred Pitt and so on. The quality of their actor skills almost always is much higher than those ones of local actors and actresses. This point is the most important one for any film which was made to fascinate people all over the world, so we should not even compare the quality of such films. Furthermore, a great film industry pays a huge attention to cameras and other technical devices which are used during film production, whereas local companies cannot afford it. Governments and societies do not give any financial support to local industries, so we can not reach this gap now, but we should try. So, the most important argument for watching western films is a high quality of films, which is no more than the result of a great funancial support.
Another point that is worth noticing is the process of globalisation at the 21th century. As everybody knows, western companies always demonstrate products of a high quality, user-friendly, which are easy to understand for groups of people. So, the globalisation encourages us to use all achievements of humanity, and films are not an exception in this case. People want to watch and use things of a great quality, they try some strange products just as a challenge and never want to return to this again. This phrase is suitable to describe a situation in film industry as a whole. Having opportunities to watch high approciated films even for free, people will not just try to watch something worse from local companies. Furthermore, local companies try to be similar to western companies and add similar plots to films, this strategy does not work in this way. They had better use some local historical and cultural plots for films and work for local auditory without ambitions to reach stars without special technical devices and professional actors. If they begin from some local stories and something which is much closer to a real life of a local man, it will be much easier but more interesting for local people. In my point of view, we should use something which was never showed by somebody else and this way can help us become leaders in this small part of a huge cinema industry without comparing to western films with history which is so different from our one.
To sum up, I want to say that a financial support is necessary for the development of local film industries, but they should change the direction of the development of shooting. In this case, people can prefer local films rather than British or American ones.",75,2,2

In my opinion, there can be a lot of reasons for such growth of the problem. First of all, in our busy world many parents sometimes tend to pay not as much attention to the nursery of their children as parents did before. The ideas of goodness, correct behavior and etc are often not explained to children well enough. Beside that, social media propaganda of different cruel or dangerous things being “cool” or “fun” also plays it’s role. Young people very often cannot separate information on the one you should trust, and the one you should not. Also, supposedly, it could be because of the higher amount of stress which people receive nowadays in all age categories, or the eager of the young for adrenalin.
What society really can do to help the problem is to promote correct values and inform people of what happens when you commit a crime. Parents and teachers should make sure that their kids and student are aware of the consequences, and should explain why it is so important to follow the rules and the law, and show good examples themselves. I believe that when given the right knowledge young people cannot grow up into criminals.

Children are our future and their education in all spheres of life is very important for all of us, so we should definitely work hard to help each of them to become the best humans they can be.",70,2,1

However, nowadays that problem doesn't seem so crucial any more. It is generally agreed that both men and women have equal rights. That is why, it is declared that equal number of male and female students should be accepted to Universities. But is it really so?
Frankly speaking it seems to me that such idea isn't worth doing as students should be accepted in accordance with their mental abilities , exam results and personal talants and capabilities. Only in that case, justice and equality can be reached. Besides, it also must be pointed out that there is a tendency for both groups to choose particular subjects . It is is undeniable that math, physics, engeneering are more preferable among boys , while girls are interested in literature, languages, and so on. However, it can't be called an unehiable rule, and of course, there are a plenty of exceptions. What is more , population also need to be taken into account , as in some countries , the number of women prevaile.
For instance, in some Universities with technical subjects there only 10 girls and 20 boys in group.
Nevertheless, some would say, that such situation will be substantial for people to protect of their rights for getting education, especially for women who still can face the problem of discrimination.
In conclusion, it should be pointed out that every person has equal rights regardless of sex, social position , money, religion and race. That is why strongly believe that equal number of male and female students doesn't seem so vital for realising an opportunity of getting an education. The quantity of students should depend on their knowledge and capabilities and not on sex.

There were a lot of tryings to find a way, how to stop downloading of pirate copies in global web, but all of them were unsuccesfully.
There is a huge opinion that sharing illegal copies of films and music should be punished. Firstly, because of great financial losts which it causes. Most people sure that paying a huge amount of money to creators or locking in jail for a long period will stop people from copying files. But, it seems to me, this practice will be failed. First of all, there are millions of people who downloading illegal copies from the web everyday. It is quite impossible to find and punish everyone. Even if government would try to find just those people who download it, it seems to be unsuccessfull too. My opinion that the best way of solve this problem is giving people an opportunity to have an access to films and music for quite little payment. There a lot of examples nowadays, how it works. ITunes or Netflix give an access to their users, but ask them for a small annual or monthly fee. So, audience can watch films and serials, listen to music, and don’t have a great losts in money. Also, because of growing audience of this services, authors and creators have their money too.

There are a lot of discussions among scientists and other people about what is more crucial for our personal development: the characteristics from our birth or others that we get during our lives. As for me, I am personally convienced that the second one is the most important.
There is no secret that a human has not only biological features but also social. Without social part of the personality human is like an animal. He or she likes only to satisfy the needs like food, water and safety. There is a well-known example of the boy Maugli. He could not even talk cause he was isollated from the socium. SO, in my opinion, social environment is very crucial for person’s development and can easily affect and even shape our personalities.
One more fact that can proove my position is that it was scientifically discovered that our experiences that we get from our social environment can radically change our characters, views and opinions. According to the researchers, children full families are more calm, less aggressive and have more success than their peers who live only with mother or farther or have no family at all. Moreover, our parents always want us to have good friends and aduce to escape those people who can have the negative impact on us.
Taking everything into consideration, I would like to draw a conclusion that undoubtedly both characteristics we have from the birth and that we get later are very important for us. Both have an influence on our personalities, lives and future. But to my mind, we should pay more attention to our life experiences and to the consequences they lead to cause they can seriously changes us but at the same time we can partly control them. That is why we should use this knowledge fruitfully and gain only benefits.

In my opinion exactly this usually harmful effect can be a cause of “young crimes”.
Of course, internet is one of the greatest tool for making a business, providing any reseach, or even just for fan and relax. Unfortunately, it has also much harmful, crazy for educational people content. For example, I have seen the group in popular social network, VK, it was something like privat club for young people. If you wanted to enter this club you would should to record a video with your falling on behind a car on a roade. This is absolutely unacceptable. Young people are easily affected by others, even if it a dangerous, and can be cause of some crimes.
To prevent this trend, young people should be barried from this content by their parents. There are two ways. The first one is strict, parents can download a program on children devices. It will block some site. This way may create some dificulties in family relationships. The second one is better but much more difficult. Parent’s can explain their children about all consequences from harmful trend.
To summarize, the most likely cause of trend, that young people committed more crimes than ever before is an Internet crazy and harmful content. The best way to solve this problem is an explaination about every dangerous consequences of following harmfull trends from parents to their children.

However, it is usually not mentioned that, at the same time, this rate is rising for some of the groups as, for instance, teenagers and young people. In this essay I will elaborate on major causes of this problem and on some possible solutions to it.

The first factor that could lead to the increase of crimes commited by the young is a rather significant number of children who become orphans. It is a well-known fact that the example of family is vital for the right upbringing. When kids don't have this example as well as love and affection that they need so much while growing they are more exposed to the danger of becoming a part of the world of crime. In this case the burden of solving of this problem lays on teachers. If a kid is raised without parents teachers should play the role of an advisor and tutor on whom children can relay and who will be a great example of a decent person.

The second reason for the rise of the juvenile crime is the exposure of the young to the violence which they observe on a daily basis while watching TV or playing computer games. Nowadays with the technological advancement entertainment industry is developping dramatically and one of its most promising spheres is computer and 3d technology. Unfortunately, they tend to be more and more focused on violent games and films which involve burgling, kidnapping and even killing people. Children who are very sensible to the examples they see around them can adopt this behaviour and consider it as a normal one. The solution to this problem can be the restriction of acces to Tv and computers and the control of the content on them by parents. Besides, there are some special programs that can be intsalled in order to help parents to control their children's usage of computers and TV.

To conclude, although the problem of the increasing juvenile crime is extremely crucial, there are some steps and tactics that can be effective as, for instance, the support of orphans by their teachers or the control of the acces to television and computers.",70,2,2

Thus, more and more parents prefer to spend their time at work rather than with their children. There are different reasons which can lead to such situation. First of all, the career comes to the frontground. People try to get a high social position and level of income. Some of them could suppose, that their children will benefit more from the opportunities, given by money, than from spending time with parents. Furthermore, as another determination can be considered the selfrealization. For example, householders often suffer from the permanent dealing with the childcare, clearning, washing and other attributes of ordinary days. Staying at home. Most of people are aimed for bigger achivements, probably bring something to society and being useful not only for there family. However, we shouldn’t be out of respect of the possible consequences of the appropriate for such range of values behavior. Openminded children, owning an unstable contiousnoes requires a lot amount of attention to be given to them. In the contrary case, parents might provoke the lack of love and care, and, therefore, the deviative, unsociable behaviour of their children. They should avoid children from the dangerous things and take part in forming children’ worldview in an appropriate way. They have to teach them live principles and a varity of very important issues. All in all, althouth there are reasons for parents to go out to work for the most of time, children shouldn’t face the lack of love, knowledges and parents preventing, as for the future selfconfidence and success is it nessecarily and unavoiding contributed.

But others claim that it is normal nowadays.
I agree that downloading films and music on the internet instead of buing it is illigal. Producers and musicians invest a lot of money and force for it. It is their job and it is unnormal that they cannot get money from sales their disks. Moreover, stolling on the internet can conduct to stolling in real life. Children can think that it is usual to get something without paying. Maybe punishing can change this filthy situation. Why some people get money for their labour and others not?
On the other hand, sometimes prices for films, music and other files is really huge. If I want to watch film I must have money. But if I have not it I can lose a lot of information (in situation with films) and it can badly influence on me and my relations with other people. Moreover, it is possible that people do it because they do not know for what exactly they pay. I mean, it is quite strange to pay money for film which will be closen after ten minutes.
In addition, I believe that, on the one hand, coping and sharing music and films on the internet should be punished (but not hard) because of forces and souls which were expended on creating films and music. But on the other hand, punishing can has bad influence on fans and their love to art.

Secondly, these social websites provided with special functions (such as “to share” and so on) make it easier to spread information: you have an opportunity to share some facts with both your friends or just people who yo do not know. On the other hand, for some people social media means only entertainment. The reason is that it is widely believed that social websites are not reliable sources of information, which contain many biased opinions as everybody can share their point of view. Furthermore, using social media many people cannot    focus on essential or useful information because they are easily distracted by their friends writing them too often. That is why, sharing knowledge by social media tends to be useless. To sum up, I would like to say that social websites may be used on various ways it depends on a personality of a user, however, I believe that social media such as Facebook is created sharing knowledge as I suppose that entertainment online is not a good idea, people should do it in other way (such as meeting with each other). So, social media – a good way to share information).

We can do great things through the web like education, shopping, connection etc. But also do crimes. On of the most discussed problems is an illegal content copying. Developers lose their money and no one could be punished.
To my mind, the problem is not as big as it is supposed to be. Authors still has their money from sells. They do not think that person who steal content today may like it and buy it tomorrow. People should not be punished for downloading pirate copies. It is hard to blame them for saving money. Especially in Russia where legal copies of films and video games cost too much comparing with average revenues.
It is useless to ban pirate sources because I know at least one perfect way to decrease illegal copying. A lot of people use services like Apple Music or Spotify. They allow to listen music for small pay every month with speciel offers for students. So did Netflix, HBO, Amedia. They created striming services with huge amount of TV-series and films for 10 dollors per month that millions of internet users forgot about their PirateBay accounts. So the answer is not to punish people but make the offer which will make them to refuse from illegal copying.
Modern technologies like smartphones, tablets, Wi-Fi and mobile Internet allows developers and companies to create and sell content accordingly to auditory’s requests and they shoul use their possibilities. Judging everyone is complected and expensive process.

So, what is better: to work some time or to study at University straightaway?
On the one hand, the benefits of the first point of view cannot be denied. Firstly, it is a perfect opportunity to work for a year in order to think what do you want to be. For example, you can try yourself in different spheres and decide, what is more appropriate for you. Secondly, travelling for a year before university studies is suitable way for those who did not decide where he is going to work. For instance, if a person do not desire to work in his native town or country, he can travel a little bit and choose a place he wants.
On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of nussing a year. First of all, people finished high school do not have enough skills to work before the university. So, their knowledge is pretty low and they are not able to understand what they want, Secondly, when this year between high school and university is over, the person can understand, that studying skills are already lost, that he is not able to continue education because of the fact that he just forgot how to do it. 
In conclusion, I suppose that it is better to continue studies straightaway after finishing high school. Possibly, it is better not to change your workplace only because you do not have enough skills, may be it is better to change studyplace and in the end to find a place that is perfectly suitable for you.

Personally, I agree with this statement. Watching sport will not make us smarter or better. It won't also inform us about something that we didn't know before. So, because of this, I think that people can do something more useful for them instead watching sport. Moreover, there are some sport fans who too keen on thair favourit team and it can lead to having an arguments with fans of another team.
However, some people can't agree with this. They think that sport helps us to express our patriotic feelings because most of people support team from thair countries.

It is also a good way to have a rest after a difficult day.

Many people believe that the best way to make amount of crimes less is to give longer prison sentences. I can agree with this statement due to several reasons. First of all, crime itself is a big sin because it is unfair to do bad things to other people. I believe that if a person who break the law has to pay for this and there would not be any exception. For instance, in Russia if a person kills someome he/she can be pisoned for only 10 years. I think, it is not an appropriate sentence and it must be prolonged. In addition, when a prisoner comes back in ""normal"" life, he can not normally live. It happens because he/she already has bad feautes and he/she can do a crime again. Also, other part of society can not trust  ex-prisoned people, therefore they have a problem to find a job, thus they can become bulglars due to a lack of money. On the other hand, some people believe that there are alternative ways of reducing crime. For instance, many of them organize some meetings to help ex-prisoners to cope with  return to a 'nornal' life. Some say that these meetings really help people to recover both mentally and physically after their life in prison. It is a pity that in the most of cases it does not help and ex-prosiners break the law again. To sum it up, there are more advantages in keeping law breakers longer in prison. It can be a really effective way to reduce crime and to make safety for society, because a lot of people who were in prison make crimes over and over again.  ",60,2,1

To begin with, I think that sport is always suitable idea in issues connected with health improvement, as it makes people physically strong and healthy. For example, jogging or going to the gym are quite affordable and help to avoid coach potato lifestyle. On the other hand, I am strongly believe that any sport without healthy diets will not give necessary improvements. As a consequence, people should remember  about avoiding saturated fats and should consider about nutritions. For instance, people should prefer eating fruits and vegetables to eating junk food.

War is dominating in these state and this is the cause of that businessmen leave these countries and people lose their jobs.
Secondly, I would like to notice that Southern Asia has a very low level of unemployment. This is the cause of high level of post injustfisation which creates exrenent conditions for business thanks to which the level of unemployment was steadily going down in the previous years.
In addition, I would like to observe some rapid changes in the EU, Latin America and Middle East: 1) European Union has a big migrant income which to that fact that migrants get jobs and it creates a gap for europeans which increases the level of unemployment.

In my essay I will focus on main causes and solutions to this issue.

To offer the most suitable solutions we need to go deeper into causes of this problem.One of the crucial factor is the consumption of drugs and alcohol which is increased among young people. The youth can't control themselves and their behaviour while being under the influence of alcohol.For instance,in Britain we can observe lots of fistfightings near pubs and clubs during night time.Moreover,the major part of the youth don't have enough knowledge about the danger of drugs and alcohol.That's why young people become drug addict.They have an urgent need to have money and to satisfy their addiction.It's a trigger to commit a crime.
There are variety of solutions which can help resolve this issue.Firstly,if the governments want to tackle this problem they should apply a much stricter system of penalties and punishments for offending crimes and also for the useage of drugs and alcohol. It might work,but in addition we need to improve our educational system.For example,teachers can learn students about safety,provide them with knowledge about narcotic substunces,drug and alcohol addiction.Furthermore, parents should control their children.They need to have a close-knit relationship with their children to prevent them from the danger of streetlife.

However, some people believe that such an activity does not worth our time. This essay disagrees with this statement because the sphere of sport plays a great role in our life today. In this essay I will provide some reasons in order to support my opinion, followed by the relevant examples.
As for the first point, watching live sports occasions or TV matches can make people closer to each other. When people have more free time on their hands, they gather together, support their team and communicate. A good exapmle here can be the The World Hockey Championship which is hold every year in spring. Spectators become like one team which watch all the matches, reveal some mistakes of players and spend good time. For instance, the play between Russia and Finnland is always complicated beacuse these teams are usually neck and neck. In other words, it is a level playig field, and people can realize what the real patriotic feeling is.
As for another point, the process of watching such sports events may help people, especially women, to know more about different types of sport. What I mean is that we can learn the special vocabulary, which is considered to be specific for each kind of sport. Moreover, in our daily life we use a great number of idioms and phrases in our speech which have come from sport. For example, the idiom ""to jump the gun"" from racing which means ""to hurry"" or ""to do something before a start"".
In conclusion, I would like to say the theme of sport is vital today and plays a signifant role. That is why watching sports events is essential and people who belive that it is a waste of time should rethink this issue.",70,2,0

One of the most serious problems is a crime among teens.However, there are several ways of solving this particular issue. Now I am going to demonstrate 3 of them.

Firstly, parents should educate their children from the earliest childhood very properly. They have to explain what is the crime, what children are forbidden to do, how can they be punished. For example, parents of Artem who is 5 years old punished him very strictly for taking a toy( car) from another boy in a kindergarden. Thanks to this action from parents Artem understood that he does have to give the toy back to the boy and, moreover, never should do it again.

Secondly, teachers can help avoid the growth and even decline of the crime among young people by providing them with certain knowledges. There is no difficulties in including lessons about the harm of this problem into school shcedule. For instance, the lesson can be called 'crime and punishment'( as the name of Dostoevsky book) and srtict rules and thing that are forbidden should beteached there. It would not be bad to read and talk about the book at this lesson too. It is a reallly worth-discussing theme.


Furthermore,the most efficient way for parents and teathers to make the world better and safer for their children is to cooperate and do their best to protect teens together. It can be done by methods that i have descrebied above. In addition, they can show what happens to people who did such a silly mistake in their lives and what consequances they received.
( the prison, no job, no family, no education) As an example, we can imagine life of the corruptionist who lost everything after revealing his bussiness.
To sum up, the more parents and teachers do, the better life will be in future.",65,2,0

Some people strongly believed that athlets, who used illegal drugs, should be banned for the period of 2 years. They think about limited period. However, others think that Sport Federation must ban them for the rest of their lives.
Supportes of the first opinion tell that we need to give for a sportsman a chance for a new life without illegal drugs. Moreover, in theory, person who know that he was banned, but society remember his old wins and believe him, he may be to not use drugs again. It is not guaranteed, but we will have a chance, that criminal will not be continue. in future.
On the other hand, opponent of this view do not agree with these arguements. They think that person, who did crime in last time, would do it again. It makes conclusion: we need to protect sport from these sportsmans: that is why they must be banned for the rest of their lives.
As for me, I agree with arguements of the first party of conflict. Firstly, every person has a right on a second chance after crime. In spite of the fact of a serious crime, nobody can get a future career, wins and success of other person - if this crimer will be a good sportsman without drugs, he can take part in international competitions, when he wants it.
Taking everything into accaunt, I can conclude, that athlets should be banned for a limited period, because ban for all life can get from person suceess and his favourite profession on all life - noone can do it.

hapiness because persons are so different and each of us has different definitions of the 

happiness. And  as a result we use different things for achivieng it, as they depend on our 

vision of happiness.
Everybody tries to find their own hapiness. First of all, I should say that if the person 

doesn't feel happy at all he or she doesnt see any sense of life. Secondly, I consider, 

that if you found your place in the world , you found your own happiness.
Different people consider as happiness different things. Thus, for some people hapiness is 

new gadget, for others is their family. Tastes is differ: people do various types of 

activity and find pleasure in different things. For one happiness is doing sport, for other 

reading favourite book: intrests may very. According to this we can see misunderstanding 

between people in question: ""What is happiness?""
It's common knowledge, that happiness is love, health, family. As for me, if I feel lonely  

I cannot be happy as I find happiness in love and communication. Also, you cannot feel 

happiness if you are ill or have pain. Relationships in family support us in difficult

First of all, I think that such type of social activity could help young people to improve their communicating skills and make their adaptation in society much easier.
The second reason why I support the necessarity of such community service is that young generation are best candidates for charity and helping old people and children. When I was learning at school we did a lot of unpaid charity doing. When you are young and healthy, it’s the best time to help other people and society in general to make their life better. Also, free social activity will convince older people that young generation is not lost and able to give use to society.
But we should not only include such community service to high school programme, we also need to organize it right way. Every school must organize it’s pupils to groups which will do sociably-useful work. Besides, those schools will be needed to make advertisement, to talk, for example, to old people and explain to them that excepting help from young people who work in such charity group, will help them to save money.

I try to demonstrate this issue from economical and social sides. First of all, it is the most fastest kind of transport, a plaining flight, as no one ecological sourse could exchange it. For instance, some business negotiations, valuable meetings and international conferences are unimagibale without convinientant confortable conditions, getting to the destanation. Moreover, some post offices and express delays would have no profit, if government decide to cut down and international and domestic flights. Secoundly, people, especially in Russia, finally get access of visiting different countries all over the world. I strongly believe that an aviation has to be free for majority of people. However, dealing this issue, I suppose, that private flights could be reduce for protecting our nature and surviving climate. For example, if some rich businessmen prefer travelling by train or by car, I would save an enormous amount of fuel, that has spent for surviving only 10 people on a board. Anyway, there is an opinion that in any case flying in the sky badly effect on our environment and only way is to stop an aviation. I suppose, the problem could be solved upgrading materials, methodics of proving flights, sources of energy and other important elements that have a great harmful impact on an ecology. For instance, while planes have crashed, and such accidents happend much more frequantly than pilots expected, could fall down to the Ocean or just bump into ground. I believe, that reducing such negative effect a society and government will able to help progressing aviation and save a natural beauty of environment. All in all, technological progress brings benefits and failures for the both society and government.

These industries loose a lot of money because of it. I agree with the position that illegal sharing of content on the Internet is theft. But I think that the low should punish only people who share these products, not who downoland.

Nowadays, making films or recording songs or albums cost a lot of money. And one of ability to return this money is showing films in cinematheatres or buying music content in the Internet appstore, for example, iTunes or Google Play. If the song or film is on the Internet, people do not buy it legal or do not want to go to the cinema because he or she can watch it at home in chair. So ‘pirates’ don’t allow companies to return their money. So this phenomen of modern society is theft.

I repeat once more, I think that only people who share illegal content should be punished. Some musicians or directors may share their products themselves. So, people, who downoland some contents, don’t know who shares this.

To sum it up, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet is serious problem for makers. The government should take necessarying lows for solving this problem.

From my point of view, it goes without saying, that tastes differ. According to this, there is not only one answer to the question revealed in the introduction.
Nevertheless there are some stereotypes about the success, but has nothing against with the happiness. Somebody consider that the main goal in their life is creating the family, others think it is a good job. As for me, I suppose, happiness is not achievement, it is a feeling of freedom, love or looking for you child. Hapiness is something light, something that you can’t describe as new flat, for example.
The main features of achieving these emotions are smile and kind, in my opinion. We should take it more seriosly, because happiness ensures the success. As for factors, which have influence on our feelings, I’d like to pay attention to family, weather and health. These are the basis of hapiness.If you have lovely people, see sum and you are healthy, there is no problem which you can’t reduce.

But what factory make the figures so varied?
First of all, it is the average length of life. Japan is well-known for its long-living people , and that is why the proportion of them is expected to excud 25% by 2040. However, the economic situation has not always been so brilliant , moreover, it was much worse there then in Europe and America , so the number was relatively low until the expected acute rise in 2030. Also, that is due to the fact that more children are born in Japan , and as a result, they take up some 'space' in the generations division. 
Secondly, it is social policy that afects the quality of life. After the introduction of state insurance and pensions both in the USA and Sweden , more elderly people were able to afford suitable medical treatment, housing or other benefits. Another option is the decline in the number of children per family. More and more young people decline to start a family later anf have only 1 or 2 offsprings , and this tendency will certainly bring about the growth of the proportion of the elderly people, as those born in 1975 are 65 years old by 2040.
To draw a conclusion, we may say that not only social or economic tendencies , but also government policies might cause certain changes in social proportions , consequently, these policies and tendencies should be accurately governed.

Some governments think that it is their order to control any kind of expressions of creative persons. In this essay I will try to examine the both sides of this complex issue and point out my view on this problem.
	To start with one of the strong opinion among the majority of people. They consider that creative people have a completely rule to express theirown ides and suggestions in their art works, such as pictures, films, books and others. Many people think that it is absolutely wars to prevent them from doing it, particulary if it does a government. According to their point of view, nobody may stop their development, not allowing to say their mind.
	By contrast, it is universally known that many governments introduce a strict order regarding different kind of expression of not ordinary people. The other words there are many people in the world who think that any ideas in films, music, pictures and others art works should be completely controlled by governments, because points of view and expressions of creative people may be dangerous for society, especially for young people.
	Having considered all sides of this issue, I would like to say that problem has not a clear answer, because to permit creative people to express their mind, may be considered like a crime. Whercase, to allow them do it without showing for governments is very dangerous for all age groups of people, particularly for children.

I agree that goverment must give more freedom in art ideas because artist's mission on the Earth is provide and develop people's imagination, view on their life and belive. All countryes rules control express of creative people idea.


For example, in North Korea geverment control, moreover forbit it as a result. Local population have same ideas, same lifestyle, same thinking. They do not have their own opinion, because afterwards it suppres gestures. Keeping in jail or killing. Of course it stop process of develop contry's social life.

I absolutely disagree with this extent and in this essay I’ll try to prove my point of view. 

Firstly, all of us live together on the Earth and we should help each other. But I don’t talk about gifts or presents to other countries, I mean economics, Different countries produce different goods. Food is one of the most important part of trading and producing. But technologies such as modern computers and medicines are important too. While ones invent new machines, others plant food. It ca be really difficult for one country to produce enough food and enough other goods for all population. That’s  why it would be better to import some food and to get some medicines, for example. 

Secondly, the size of countries varies. As for Russia it has amount of ground to plant food. Also different climates in some parts mean that a lot of types of food can be plain there. But there is a little territory in Japan, for example. They can’t produce enough food because of the size of their country. As for population it’s more than in Russia. Without buying food from other countries it will be hard to exist. That’s why it will be great if countries with big territories import their food. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that producing food not only to population of your country helps a lot to other countries and your own one.

Some people suggest that increasing of sport facilities is the best solution and it will give results, but there are a lot of opponents of this point of view. So, this problem is wonrh to be discussed. 


On the one hand, such actions will have some positive results. For example, when the amount of sport facilities increase, there will be none children, who will be keen of sports. They will do sports since their childhood, so it is a chance to grow health nation. But the result will be seen only in the future, so is difficult to help adult person to improve their health, using this method.


On the other hand, such actions are not so effective, because the majority of our country population consists of adult people and pensioners. And it isn't effective for their poor health to do different sports to improve it. They need to have high quality medicine to support their health. And the government should invest in medicine area, especially in pharm area. If me have innovations in our medicine, we can help our adult people and pensioners to live long life. And it will be the best solution of public health problem. 


As for my opinion, I consider, it is necessary to realize complex actions to achieve a real result. Our government should spend money on improving sport facilities for next generations and invest money on improving medicine level for adult people. There is no doubt, that it is a long process, because it requires a huge invest capital and the productive work of medicine scientists, but it is the single method to decide public health problem productively.

However, the main part of the socity keeps downloading music and films from the Internet.

On the one hand, you can say that such people are totally wrong. First of all, a fee for a legal product is relativelly low, so anybody can pay it. Besides, the money earned by song of film goes not to one person, but spreds between members of a big working team, such as actors, producers, directors, musicians, dancers, designers, operators and so on. Moreover, costumes, scenery and background for a movie, music video or sometimes a concert are also have it’s own price, which is payed from money public give for the finished product. In result, when people make pirate copies, companies are left with a huge lack of money and can even be closed which makes pirating a theft.

On the other hand, ordinary people will disagree with that. One of the reasons is that companies can also get money from adverticement, worldtours or showing their movies in cinema. Comparing to that, money payed for downloading from the Internet just do not play any role.

In addition, when public really like the product, it will finally get all the money it owns, because people will want to see the star alive in the concerts or watch the movie on a big screen in cinema, so free downloading can actually bring a good income to companies.

To sum up, I strongly believe that making illegal pirate copies is a bad thing. The main reason for that is because it is harmful to the entertainming culture all in all. The money peope do not pay for downloading could be used to make new interesting movies and music. Trueth be hold, I think that if you want expand your horizons by watching good films or listening to music, it is crucial to pay authors what they deserve.

The same situation is within the women. At the age of 16 to 24 they spent 114,1 minutes doing activities, while at the ahe over 75 women spent just 10 minutes doing sport during the whole year. It is evident that the men at the age of 16 to 24 exercised more in 2012 than women and people of other ages. And the women at the ahe over 75 did less activities than men and youg people. To continue, the chart shows that men at the age of 25 to 34 spent more time doing sport than men at age of 35 to 44. The difference is almost 20 minutes during the year. The most interesting thing is that women at the age of 25 to 44 spent the same time on sport, about 93 minutes.

Present-day man spends a lot of time using computers and laptops in a wrong sitting position. This may cause a number of back diseases. Another evident problem is permanent headache which is caused by daily use of electronic devices. This is partially because watching on the screen for a long period of time affects brain and eyes in a strong, negative way.

However, there are some possible ways to relief those problems. In order to get rid of back pain, people should add more physical activity in their everyday routine. This will partially relief the affect from long time computer use. Another thing we can do is to reduce the amount of time spent in front of the screen. This may be done by reorganizing our leisure time. For instance, we can replace the tradition of watching TV in the evening by walking in the park or reading a book.

In my opinion, the modern way of life makes children more cruel and lonely which lead to boost in crimes among teenagers.
To begin with, there are many reasons why young people decide to commit a crime. Firstly, the content that we see on TV or Youtube is mostly violent. Computer and telephone games are full of murders, blood and cruelty. It is not a surprise that after seeing crimes everywhere a person decriminalizes it in his or her head and starts to think that it is normal. Secondly, adults are tent to work more nowadays, which is why parents does not communicate with their children much. It can lead to kids' depression and a feeling of loneliness. To draw the parents' attention, kids become thieves because it seems to be The only way to become visibe for parents. The last but not the least, it is extremely difficult for a young person to find a job in modern society because of lack of working experience. It can lead to stealing. Not being able to earn enough money legally, young people start being involved in illegal actions.
The most significant issue here is to find a way of tackling this problem. To my mind, parents should spend more time with children, explain them that there is always a way of solving a problem without cruelty. Parents should give their kids enough love, care and support, which will lead to better emotional health of children. As for teachers, they should talk more about values, be role models for children and explain that kids can become successful while being honest and kind.
To sum, there is a problem of a widespread criminal involvement among young people, but parents and teachers could help solving it.

Using this information I can make interesting conclusios.
First of all, it is brightly presented that the old use sociall networks less, than the young. We can see it most vividly on the example of Instagram. 53% of the young (18-29) use it and at the same time only 6% of the old (65+) prefer this network. It is also important to highlight that there is a solid tendency: the older the person is, the less probably he or she spends time on Facebook or Instagram.
My second important observation is that there is no big difference by age in groups of people using LinkedIn. Surprisingly, middle-aged people (30-49 and 50-64) use LinkedIn a but more frequent than the young or the old (31% and 30% vs 22% and 22% respectively)
Last but not least I want to pay attention to the volume of users of the three given social networks. Clearly, any age group uses Facebook more often, than Instagram or Linkedin. Even the minor group of Facebook users (people aged 65+) is 56% whereas only 53% of the people aged 18-29 use Instagram and they are the major group of Instagram users.

Recent data reveals that more and more adolescents get involved in crimes, therefore the problem requires quick and efficient solution. In this essay we will discuss the major reasons of such statistics and identify prospective means using which teachers and parents could fight this trend.
Needless to say, our world is full of contraversies and dangers, so young people are frequently exposed to illegal activities. To begin with, development of Internet and social networks weakens parent’s ability to bring up their children properly. The Web which content is not always law-abiding and positive greatly impacts teenager’s worldview. Second, crimes and violence have already become a part of the mass-culture and these ideas are further developed by blockbusters and video-games. Finally, recent economic difficulties damaged family well-beings, consequently young people might have been commiting crimes for economic purposes. To sum it up, I assume that improper cultural environment, questionable leisure activities and financial factor aggravate the problem of adolescent crime.
I strongly believe that joint efforts of teachers and parents are indespensable for eliminating youth’s criminal activity. As I have mentioned above the perspective roots of the problem lie in the area of leisure time and economic environment, so these matters should be prioritized. Most of the crimes are likely commited out of school, so parents and teacher should ensure that adolescent’s free time is passed properly. Introduction of extra-curriculum activities that focus on communication and personal development (for instance, sports, drama classes etc.) would alter teenagers schedule and drastically decrease the risk of wrong-doings. As for - contraversial values shown in mass-culture, parents and teachers should educate the young on such issues as law-abideness and public safety. In case people are fully aware of the grim consequences of criminal offense they would less likely commit it. Deteriorating economic conditions detriment adolescent’s quality of life, consequently households and schools could request the local authorities to finance afore-mentioned initiatives to cut the crime rate.
All in all, the problem of crime among the youth remains vitally significant and should be tackled with urgency it deserves. To reverse such a negative trend parents and teachers should implement a coherent set of measures that eliminate underlying causes of misconducts and wrongdoing committed by adolescents.

Media provides us news about murders, beatings and shopliftings committed by young people more and more frequently. This essay analyzes causes of this phenomenon, and what can be done by parents and teachers to solve it.
I personally think that there are two reasons of this development. The first one is that today more and more young parents prefer their career growth rather than care for their family. So, when a child is born, she receives much less attention from her parents. Later, she finds new friends, who probably grew up in the same conditions, and they do not have a set of moral values that should have been taken from their parents. As a result, they do not know what is good, and what is bad, and this group of children may become a small gang when they realize that there is easier to receive money by robbing than by legal ways. There is the additional factor which I consider as the second reason: accessibility of information that may be inappropriate for a child. The lack of parents' attention can be replaced by Internet and videogames, and the child learns new knowledge about violence, drugs or something like that very quickly but without right explanation And it can also create the wrong set of values and lead him to become a criminal.
In my opinion, what parents should do is to give enough care and attention to their children. They should control what their child watches, reads or plays, and who are her companions. However, not only parents but school teachers can make their influence on this issue: for instance, they can teach children not only math and language, but also about how to socialize and become a righteous citizen.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the problem of crimes committed by youth is very important; however, it can be reduced or eliminated by parents and teachers in primary schools.

There are probably some common reasons for that and as we can identify them we can succesfully solve them. 

Personally I think that the most usual problem  leading to bad student behavior is that students are bored. It happens, I suppose, because of old-fashioned educational system. Our everyday lifestyle has changed greatly during the last 30 years but learning systems in many countries do not take it into account. The way students percept information is new but the way information is given in schools is still old-fashioned. Thus, students easily get bored and learning process is not succesful. 

There are many ways to solve this problem. For instance, schools in Norway use modern methods of education, allowing students do what they want and including lots of interactive lessons. Teacher should try to make their way of teaching more living to attract students’ attention. 

However, that is not only schools that should worry about student behavior. Home is the first place where student’s attitude to studying is forming. It is often that parents do not pay enough attention to the process of nursing that includes making a child like learning. For example, some parents are so busy with their work that do not spend time reading books with children or answering their questions about the surrounding world. Thus, step by step a child loses his curiousity and begins to hate studing. This problem may be solved by providing special programms for parents that teach parents the importance of right way of communicating with children so that they love the process of learning. 

Summarising my points I should say that I see two main problems that lead to bad students behaviour in schools: old-fashiond way of teaching and parents’ poor attitude to the process pf nursing. All these problems can be solved by special governmental programes and, of course, by acts of individuals.

That is why it is very important to understand the causes of this trend in order to solve this issue.
First of all, it is obvious that millennials at their current age have more opportunities and higher living standards than their parents or grandparents had. Young people often do not need to be concerned about how to help their family and so on. This results in a larger amount of free time, which, unfortunately, is not fully occupied by useful things such as sports or studying. In other words, young people have enough time to do whatever they want, which sometimes includes getting into “wrong” companies of friends, who can rob or attack innocent people just for the sake of fun. That is one of the mechanisms how young people can start to commit crimes.
Another reason of the described trend of more crimes committed by the young age group people might be as follows: current media produce a lot of content which is connected with cruelty, and young adults become more tolerant to crimes by wathing such content. For instance, news agencies often try to show some awful and scaring videos from the places of accidents such as airplane crushes, car accidents or terrorist attacks. Such videos spread extremely quickly in social networks, which are very popular among youngsters. As a result, especially this age group faces a lot of cruelty online through these videos.
In order to tackle the above-mentioned causes of the problem, I would, firstly, suggest creating multiple hobby clubs at schools, so that pupils could have a variety of things to do in their free time. Evidently, this measure would be even more effective, if school students had an obligation to attend at least several hobby clubs. As for the cruel content on TV and on the Internet, it can be wise to put more age restrictions on it. However, it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of an opposite effect which in that young people might get angry, if they are prohibited to watch something. I believe that such effect can be avoided, if both mentioned measures are implemented, because then young people will not have time to try to watch prohibitted content. Also, parents should pay attention to what their children are occupied with.
To sum up, it is necessary to emphasize that the problem can be effectively addressed only if a combination of techniques is used. In this case both teachers at schools and parents at home should be attentive to the children and surround them with support. It would be the best way to destroy any incentives to commit crimes.

Anyway there is an argue on this topic, so there are people who believe in other alternative ways of reducing crime which are better in their opinion. The first group of people arguing on this topic, think that all those who commit crimes should get their corresponding prison sentence. If the crime is hard, the person must get the longest prison sentence, otherwise after leaving the prison this person will be able to make the crime once again. So the prison sentence should be as long as the crime maker deserves or he will not understand the extent in which he was wrong. Increasing the prison sentence will reduce the number of people who are able to make some kind of crime, because they would not like to be given such a long prison sentence. So people who know what is expected to them will think before committing crime. Nevertheless there are people who believe in existence of other ways of reducing crime that can be more liberal for person that have committed a crime. For example one of these ways can be a work of a psycologist with a person who was wrong in his actions. So if person do not understand that his action is bad and wrongit, the psycologist will explain it.  In my opinion the first group of people is right, so I think the longer prison sentence will reduce crime, but not any alternative and liberal ways. People who commit crimes are abnormal, their psychics is not the same as normal people's. So any alternative way of reducing crime will not be as efficient, as heavy one for the person which is able to commit a crime.    . ",70,2,2

As for me, I can not totally agree with them, because the interests of both genders are really different.
First of all, it is well-known fact that there are two groups of specialization: human studies and technics. Men are more tend to the second, such as physics, geometry, enjyneering, while women prefer the first one, for instance, literature, art or music, economics. Scientists explain that people have more success in exactly these subjects due to the specific male and female mind.
Moreover, because of this first fact, in my view, it will be impossible to teach equally groups of two genders. There will not be enough stidents in one specialization and even lot in another one. According to statistics there are more women than men in the world, so the equal number of them at universities is an unbelievable dream.
Finally, the government should not accept such system in educational sphere, because, in this case, the youth in country will not be happy and pleased with its freedom for choice. From my point of view, it will lead to dissatisfied population and serious political troubles.
However, I understand that the government is able to make an attempt. It means that some prestigious universities, for example, the main state town’s university, can provide equal places in popular studies for young abiturients. It is possible that this decision will be a good step for improvement of status of a certain subject.
To conclude, I do not believe that equal numbers of both sexes at universities is right for them. They even do not have such opportunity due to modern statistics of world population. On the other hand, of course, some of them can try to accept this law in their educational politics and increase their popularity among young people.

On the one hand, increasing the number of sports facilities could be a good measure to manage this problem. Sport helps us to be in a good shape. It will be useful to organise different sport activities for children at school. Physical activity help to prevent obesity and other diseases. If human do sport he or she will never start to smoke, for example.
But on the other hand, some people think that sport facilities would have little effect on public health and there are other useful measures. For instance, government should provide lows that help to reduce pollution. Moreover, there are a lot of stress today in life that influence our health. So people need to have more relaxation. Also we are always in a hurry and we want to eat fast. Fastfood become very popular in our life but it does not a healthy food.

In other words, international companies create many working places, stimulate local producers, from which they buy resources and pay huge taxes. Second possible advantage is that economicy do not develop main world centers but develops almost equaly in whole world. For instance, car European car producers moved part of their business to the Africa, so this brought some development. On the other hand, business moving has a lot of critics who notice negative points of this process. Firstly, that is known that usually international companies relocate their factories to get more low paid workers and to remove ecological danger from home country. For example, near the River in India there a lot of relocated manufacturies which pollute air, water and soil so-located people suffer from this. Secondly, these international companies have no competitors in country market. They are economically strong and some companies just can not compite with them so this bring stagnation to the country.

Some people believe that equal amount of boys and girls should be accepted in every faculty. But I fully disagree with this opinion.
I personally believe that acception of a person to the University mustn't depend on his gender but his marks. At first, this may cause a situation , when scores for acception of a faculty will differ much between boys and girls, which , I believe is not correct. After that, big difference in marks can cause bad social conditions between students because students with lower education may feel depressed if they are not well prepared for university. Preparation for future life is extrimely important in higher education and young people must understand that at work they wouldn't be given a special quota for male and female, and that they will live, work and pass work interviews in the same conditions. For example, my mom's friend Julia, who was always thought that boys are stronger then girls and must always take care of them. When Julia came to a new job she began to work, where men behaved with women in equal way and that's why she felt depressed in this place with such conditions.
In conclusion, I'd like to say that many men many minds but I think that we should change education conditions in this way because today we have a lot of more serious problems to deal with. Besides, in my opinion , the only acceptable quotas are for invalids and for people who can't pay for their education.

There are several explanation of that situation; I think, the main reason of issues with bad behaviour at school is the lack of parents’ role in education, which is dismissed by influence of mass media.

In modern world both  of parents are so busy by work and stressful lufestyle that they don’t have time to communicate enough with their child. School which originally plays role of second agient of socialization, tend to be the only one institute to teach student how to behave. But all students can not take the same attantion at school and if causes lack of manners which is necessory for the right behaviour. If parents spend more time with their children, this problems won’t be so huge.

There is another source transating the different types of behaviour for students – the mass culture. Watching TV shows, series or cruel films with fights, violence, students become to think that it is a typical behaviour. When this child face the same situation in real life, he will probably act according to the behaviour’s model from movie. It means that society should carefully watch out standarts of films and TV shows which students are allowed to watch. For example, in Russia all films devided by several categories according to age of audience; students (under 18) must not watch movies with cruel scence.

To conclude, my point is that the best way to solve problems with students’ behaviour is increasing a role of family in children’s education and socialization. Children should see the models of behaviour not from the TV screen but from parents.

It is clearly seen, that some kinds of goods, mostly, food products are more frequently transported by road. On the other hand, it is more common to transport such things as metals and machinery by road.
It is obvious that this situation is caused mostly by two factors: the weight of products to be transported and the time in which they should be delivered. For example, such goods as chemicals and food products spoil clearly faster than metals and machinery. That is why it is better to take them to a place by road, which clearly takes less time. However, another important factor is the weight of products and materials, because it is a lot cheaper to transport heavy metals and machinery by train than by any auto-transport. Nevertheless, such things as manufactured goods which are both light and not-spoiling can be trasported by both rail and road.",65,1,1

TASK 1
	The diagrams illustrate the ages of people living in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predict the situation until 2050.
	In 2000 about a half of the population of Yemen were people from 15 to 59 years old. While in Italy there were more than 60% of these people.
	It is predicted that until 2050 the proportion of people from 15 to 59 years old in Yemen will increase to 57,3%. And in Italy, opposite, the proportion of these people will decline to 46,2%.
	In 2000 in Yemen there were only 3,6% of people older than 60 years old. While in Italy there were about one-fourth of elderly people. It is predicted, to 2050 this proportion in Yemen will rise to 5,7%, while in Italy the proportion of elderly people will increase dramatically to 42,3%.
	In 2000 in Yemen there were approximately a half of people from 0 to 14 years old. In Italy this proportion was about 14%. It is expected that until 2050 the proportion of this people will decrease sharply to 37% in Yemen while in Italy it will decline a little bit.
	To sum up, it is seen that the population in Italy is becoming older and in Yemen it is becoming younger.

They can write books, paint pictures, make film or music. But very often artists don't think about how their products can affected on people. For example, an artist can write a very sad song or make a dramatic film that can make people feel bad or unhappy. As a result, people can fall in depression. Also an artist' product can expand any dangerous idea that can be harmful for society.


For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that the artist' freedom must be limited by government. There is must be any cencer that will check the main ideas of artist' work and will decide should it be seen in society or should not. But also censor must not have any ideology, it have to only keep the psycological health of people. It does not mean that all works have to do not involve any emotions or intellegent idea. It means that this.

In Yemen it around 40-50 per cent, in contrast in Italy it very small number. Only around 10-15 percent. But the number of people, who 15-59 years old is similar.

These discussions reach their peak when we say that these facilities are the best way to make health of the society perfect.
Many people are agree with this point of view and have a lot of reasons for it. Firstly, large number of stadiums, sportsgrounds and swimming pools make sport activities closer to citizens. For instance, you will attend to some sports when they are really geographically close to you. Secondly, much more people would be healthier when the price for doing sports is reduced. In another words, it is easier to keep fit in the case it is very cheap for you. And thirdly, when people do a lot of sports, they do not have much time to ruin their health. For example, they do not drink alcohol or smoke at all.
Another group of people says that sport activities do not mean as much for our health as other measures. Their first argument is that ecological situation is more important. People who live in the countryside do not often visit gyms but live a long healthy life. Also, the economical situation of population should not be ignored. Scientists have proved that rich people are often happier and healthier than poor ones.
To sum up, the improvement of facilities for doing sports can help to make public health better but it is not the only one. At the first time we have to think about mental health (or happiness) of sitizens and only after that create new sport objects if they still would be needed.

The government tries to protect the ecology and it is social welfare. That is why there is a question – should government control air travel?
I agree that air transport creates negative effects that can do a lot harm to Earth but all kinds of industry damage ecology (for example, chemical industry, atomic factories).Government can not reduce activities of all industries (in this case people need to produce less goods with such results like famine and lack of goods). To control only air travel is pointless without influence on other dangerous industries because ecology will suffered anymore.
Moreover air travel is more fast then train travel. The plains save human resources (time is great value nowadays). People need to spent 7 days to reach Vladivostok from Moscow. It is enormous costs of time and the conditions in Russian trains are definitely uncomfortable. People suffer if they need to spent some days in trains.
Finally, it will be unefficient law because it will create a lot of problems, it will limited people’s comfortable way of life and at the same time there will be no results in protection the ecology. The global warming will continue because of other dangerous industries.

	Some people think that the morden art need to a control. The main reason why today many artists should not do what they want is the bad influence on a society. Today there are many perforanses and installations where people cut themselves, harm their health and body is destroyed.
	Throuout of the 20 centiry in USSR all the art was restriction by the goverment and it was the whole culture, that was learnd to be great people, who don’t lie and kill.
	On the other hand, art it is the free profession and there are many examples when without the goverment  artists do really beatiful things sush as drawing and paintings of Renessans. Artists need the fredoom because their works help to show the society that they really feel and think about some qustions. For example, under the disaster in Ukraine, in Mosckow there are many pictures in streets. They try to attract attantion to some society, ecological, political and other problems. Marina Abramovich keep money on the safe of the our planet, she take video perfomcences and then sell it.
	All in all, the art influenses on the society. I think art don’t need the control because artists are creative people and they must not do what people want.

People travel abroad not only for marking the places they have been or for looking the sightseeings they can’t see at home but to taste some traditional food in the country that they are visiting. For example, many people visit France not only to visit Eifel tower but to taste frog legs or green cheese.

So why we can’t afford this delicious food in Russia? Because the cooking recipe of this dilicies is the national secret that keeps tourist’s interests hot to this country.

However, there is another option why traditional food can’t go abroad. We know that Asian countries are famous for their extraordinary spicy dishes. Roasted insects, heavily hot spicy chicken wings and other strange looking stuff makes tourists to decline to taste the national cookings of Asia. From my experence, only the bravest ones tried the dishes, and less liked it. As a result nobody wants to import Asian food to their homeworld, despite that Asian people don’t need any other type of food, so they are happy with all they have eating it with sticks.

To sum up, we can see that the world trends are messing up because of national mixings. More people are going to live abroad, more families are creating form different coultures. in that case I can’t agree that food isolation in the country is nescessary.

Such companies pay money for land, worker, assuarance and, in many case, bring there their own experts so to educate the workers and to introduce modern technologies into the plants and factories.The international  companies almost always invest in many charity organisation and give extra investment into the economy. Such benefits have a positive influance on the whole countries.  It also becomes easier to companies to orginise their work in the developing countries because usually it costs extremely cheaper than in their own countries. However, many companies use such possibility to save money. For instance, the size of worker's salaries in not as high as it can be in the developed countries. Many bussinesmen suggest that worker in developing countries does not need a higher salary even though emplyees do the same amount of work as in the prosperous countries. The other aspect where companies want to save money is work condition, which can be not correspond to the appropriate standard. Then the lack of medical care is also a significant point. Local workers almost always are not provided with the suitable medicial care.  Personally, I believe that such drawbacks are significant enough to outweigh the benefits. The modern society schould control the companies when they want to thansfer their bussines so that these disadvantages can be overcome.  To sum up, moving bussines from thriving countries to poorer ones should be done appropriately. So, international companies should bring more benefits both to the busisines owners and to the local population.   ",70,2,0

This fact may transform a young society to a dangerous environment.
The problem is the absence of the moral education among the young people. If they commit crimes, they can be risen in unlucky families. The good solution for this problem is the control of social or state institutions of the attitude to these children in families. The social worker can see if the parents of a child rise him or her in good condition. Otherwise social workers can help a child to develop in more suitable conditions. The dark side of this solution is the true life that can not be so fair to you and sometimes these children stay in bad families and tempted to commit crimes.
The second solutions to the problem of rocketing of crimes by young people is the moral help and education in the schools. Young children should be able to go to a free school psycologist which can be a good secret conversationalist and help with problems or say what and how is better to do.The disadvantage of it is the misunderstanding of the specialist, that is why the cause of the conversations may be dramatical. A child can make decisions on his or her own for example, by disappearing from the family, making suicidal actions, start or continue commiting crimes.
All in all, the problem of commiting crimes by the young people is one of the serious social problem that should not be ignored.",65,2,2

I believe that every labor must be paid for people have to pay for watching movies and listening music. Music and films intellectual property and must be paid for. It is necessary to arrest people who do not pay for it, but it is worth to impose a line on there. But many people can not afford going to the movies and concerts so they download everything from the internet. In my opinions if film should not be free, that global corporation lost a lot of many, becaus people will lose respect. Because, exempl orphans can non afford to pay to fims and music concerts, like many others.

So same if the music and films is paid, the musicians and actors will lose fame, because people will stop listening and watching them moves. After all they can not pay for these services. Becaus force people to walk violently and pay violently, no one has the right. Therefore  I think, what all, and music, and movies should be free fo all people. Students in creative universities have to watch a lot of films and listen to a lot of music. If they had to pay for all this, they would not have been able to study, becays most students have not job, and have not money. 

In this essay I have showed why I think that musicians and film producers should be free, and becaus if this will not so then companies that deal musicians and film producers lose money.

By 2000 Africa had twenty millions of such boys and about twenty-four millions of such girls, what was a bit more than it was in South Asia and doubled more than it was in all rest part of World by the same year. Besides, it is worth noticing the trend that both in Africa and in South Asia (similarly with the rest world) there had a significant decline in the number of chidren who could not attend elementary school.

For instance, a lot of people start to have problems with their eyes and nervous system. 

Nowaday there are a lot of people have glasses because they use their gadgets every day. In my opinion, there are a lot of solutions of these problem. We can see that there are a lot children have bad vision. Schools should think about health of pupils. Teacher should play with pupils when they have free time.

The biggest part of modern technology consists of gadgets like tablets, smartphones, etc. They can cause some health problems, because people spend a lot of time on them. Some of diseases are: head pain, high pressure, problems with eyes and overweight. These problems are very serious and they required some ways that can help to reduce them. For instance, 2016 research, published in the New York Times showed, that over than 50% of Americans are overweight because of the lack of physical activity. Many children do not want to go in for sports because they want to play computers or smartphones. There is another factor, that can cause health problems - radiation, produced by gadgets.
But some solutions of these problems can be offered. People should spend more time in the fresh air, doing some physical activities. Employers should encourage their workers who comes to office by bycicle, for example. In Moscow there is a practise of helding spring action ""On work by bycicle"" and MSU university research shows that 45% of workers take part in it. Also, parents should spend a lot of time with children and go together to picnics, for example.

This process has both a positive and a negative side. In this essay I am going to present both of them. First of all, the obvious advantages of placing business in poorer country is the ability for owners to make their products cheaper. It happens because these countries have economy in a poor conditions, therefor citizens do not require high salaries, because they have no choice. From the poor countries’s point of view it is a complicated issue. from the one side it is the new workplaces for citizens, that is very important because of well-known problem of unemployment in such countries. However, there are many disadvantages of this situation. As the main purpose for moving the business to developing countries is to decrease costs, businessmen do not care about conditions at the workplaces. Moreover, they often do not provide their workers with social packages as it is in Western countries. As for me, I confident that the disadvantages of this situation are more significant and can’t be oppropriate by benefits for businessmen and consumers who buy these products. Overall, it seems to me that it is possible to delete these disadvantages, if the employers change their attitude towards to workers in poor countries. In this case the moving business to developing countries will solve the problem of high costs as well as the problem of unemployment in the poor countries.

On the one hand, moving developed businesses to undeveloped places, of course, leads to renewing and making this places better, because local livers get the job, have a salary, take care of their families and just rise the living level of their country. Moreover, due to placing international companies on different countries, businessmen provide international integration which develops the relations between people from different soceities and with different cultures. On the other hand, this integration can not always work. In this case it will cause different intergroup conflicts. For instance, a sit was in Uganda several years ago.

It worth noting that, machinery goods represent 2% of total transportation by road, whereas by rail machinery goods account for 12%. The amount of chemicals transported by road makes up 16%, that is 5% bigger, than in case of rail transportation. The segment of non-metalllic minerals transportation in the overall structure of road transportation is aproximmatly twice as big as in railway transportation structure.
Taking everything into consideration, it could be concluded that, machinery and metals goods are predominant in rail transportation. In contrast food products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals make up the majority of road transportation.

A gap year is a year between graduating from school and going to university, which ise very popular among American students. However, in my country, Russia, it is considered to be just a waste of time. So is it worth taking a gap year before you continue your education.
First, let’s look at advantages. To start with, it gives you time to think about what university or college you would like to go to. Secondly, for those who travel, it is a good opportunity to see the world and make friends with people from other countries. What is more, you can also get work experience during the year, try your hand at various occupations. And finally, it helps you just to relax and have a good rest before going on with your studies.
However, taking a gap year has also a few disadvantages. Firstly, you will have to spend more time on your education. As a result, you will be able to start working and making money a year later. Secondly, there is a great risk to waste your time instead of spending it usefully. This is especially true for lazy and unenthusiastic students. They might even break the law because of having nothing to do. They need to be controlled all the time.
To sum up, a gap year is a great opportunity for self- development if you use this time wisely.

It is discussed whether it is suitable to decrease the number of flights to stop the devastating impact of air travel on our planet. Surely, with development of high-speed ground travel, such as faster trains like ICE, the need for aviation slowly disappears in most developed countries high-speed train networks offer the same routes, but trains are cheaper, more ecological, more comfortable and sometimes even faster: in most cities rail terminals are situated in the center, while the airports are usually located far in suburbs. The second disadvantage of an aeroplane is comfort and security: passengers are suited in far more narrow space, which deprives of personal comfort and makes survival case of emergency more complicated, which is an actual problem, taking in account the increase in number of plane crashes and terrorist attacks.
However, there are arguments for opposite point of view. The main is a fact that airplane is still the fastest way of travelling to high-distance and remote destinations: no train can move a person from New York to Moscow in ten hours. It is especally important for countries like Russia, where the space exceeds imagination, but development of ground transport is still far from satisfactory. In the same time, building railway networks is highly expensive because of climate, so aviation is the only suitable mean of transport.

The number of children is going to stay stable: 14,3% in 2000 and 11,5% in 2050.
In conclusion I would like to say that in Yemen the big change is going to happen with children and with people of middle age. However, in Italy the number of senior people and also people of middle age will be different to 2050 year.

Some people believe that the main purpose of these networks should be to share information, while others consider that it should be on entertainment part. Both of these points of view has their advantages. First of all, social media like Facebook and Vkontakte has a lot of users, it is a great opportunity to use these networks to share information. You can post information about the event, science invent, celebration day or else and enmourse amount of people will now about this by sharing this post.   Secondly, such social media at present has a lot of Entertainment groups and “publics” as they called in Vkontakte. Mainly, such groups don’t have an interesting information, they just have finny jokes and pictures called “memes”. These groups are really popular because people spend all the time working and studing and when they “need a rest they just have a small break and scroll their newsfeed to read some posts”. To my mind, the main purpose of these social media is the opportunities to stay in contact with your friends at any time. Furthermore, the second purpose is both the entertainment and the share of information, because now people don’t want to make choice they want everything in one time. Having evaluated everything mentioned above, I can confirm that both points of view has their positive sides, however, the contact with friends is much obvious purpose of the social media.

However, it is enought murder, which kill people just for fun or for pleasure in the world or people, who has psyhology problems.
For the first one it could be enought a few years in the prison, because they did the wrong step and must be taken punishment. But in my point of view it is necessary to try the death penalty in our country for the people, who rape the children and kill them, because they are heavy sick and it is not changing by the time. And just prison is not enough for them, because after that, they are going to have freedom again in the soon time and they will be doing awful things again. I think, that death penalty can doing people very scared and they will avoid to do crime.
Of cours, there are some alternative ways of reducing not so heavy crime - it's society work. I guess, that it's good solution: person, who choose the wrong way, can be advanced by helping people and society.

There are different oppinions on this topic. Some people agree with this when others give many reasons and present disadvantages of proportional position.
I agree with position about accepting equal numbers of male and female. I think universities should practise this. First of all, in that situation all of students should feel better , than in the situation, when in class there are more girls or boys. In different scientific articles or materials it can be founded, that male and female has different types and strategies of thinking. I think, proportional system of students can helps to understand for person both strategies of thinking , look at the same problem in different ways. Fuithermove, it is useful skill not only for studding process, but also for life and work.
Moreover, it should be noted that number of male and female students influence behavior. For my own experience I can make comparison that choising proportional system in education is really very important part. For example: in my school I educated in the class of girls. Only when I was in 10th class the situation changes some girls feel uncomfortable and their behavior became worse that it was earlier.
The next reason related with competition between male and female. Nowadays, it is not secret that girls become better in some ways of life than boys. For example, girls move attentivly than boys, they ready for help in higher way. But also not all people agree with this extent. So the competition can gives objective results for students, professions and reseavehes. Also it is reason for self-developing.
In conclusion , I would like to say that universities make right choise , when accept equal number of male and female in every subject , but it is not availible now, case of the general population of male and female is not the same.

However, someone suppose that it is not the only and best way of decrease of one. In fact, such statement may be well founded, because more strict laws motivate bandits to change their opinion about possible consequence. In fact, it is extremely challenging to understand their behavior and predict wheather this way changes their mind. It can be noticed that longer prison sentences may be an effective way to reduce crime, if it is not the only accepted measure. In my view such campaigns should include complex activities such as more qualify prison security in order to avoid running from prison. Moreover, it tends to believe that people working in the government or businessmen who have a huge influence alwase have a way to avoid a prison, if they broke a law. In this way, fighting with corruption if one of most vital measures, which will probably causes the reduction of crime. Overall, suppose it is excellent way not to come up with way to decrease the crime level, but to research the current situation in the world to find countries with the lowest crime level and understand the main reasons and aspects of that successful situation. As a result, government of other countries will gain an experience. To conclude, reduction of crime level is extremely important, but still challenging problem. Unfortunately, in my opinion, there is no universal algorithm, how to reduce it, and such problem will not be solved only by increasing prison sentences. The measures must be complex and should be inextrible linked to different areas of our social life.

Secondly, to my mind, level of education doestn depend from equal amount of boys and girls. There are no logical opinions , how it depends from it.
Another people supose, thet it can help us to go from one step of our socializing : communication with girls and boys , what will help us in our future. I think it is wrong.

The most obvious observation is that the number of people who use mobile version of Facebook dramatically increased during the year between March 2012 and March 2013. Mobile version gained 40 millions of users, reaching almost 100 million of users in March of 2013. On the opposite, there was a slight decrease in number of users of desktop version, it lost about 15 millions of users. Nevertheless, it is still more popular than mobile version, having about 135 millions of users.
Another chart gives us information on main reasons to use Facebook among men and women. Most of the women (54%) see Facebook as a platform for sharing media content, a lot of men (39%) agree with it. The same percentage of men and women (about two fifth of users) use it mainly for receiveng updates. Greater number of women just looks for funny posts on Facebook, whereas number of men who use Facebook this way is 8% less. Facebook can be not only a way to entertain yourself but also a platform to make it easier to help others. More than a third of women who use Facebook see it as one of main reasons to use it.

Nowadays the technology allows to steal their product, which means stealing money, so easily that almost any user can do it. It is a crime and pirates should be legally prosecuted.
It was made possible to exchange information freely and in great amounts. To produce this information costs a lot of effort and money for creative people. A usual worker is paid for creating the product, so it would be fair if musicians and producers of films could be as much as they deserve. Because of sharing files on the Internet they lose bigger money than ever: many people prefer enjoying free films at home rather than paying for original records or going to the cinema. Taking pirate copies is a theft, and it should not be left this way.
Another argument is from a side of moral hazardness. A free-riding has always a problem for many generations. But in the past it was simpler to control free-riders: sharing something implied a real-life contact. Now a virtual reality gives a broad space for possibilities not to buy something and use it without being punished. Music or films copied and shared on the Internet with one user and another makes it feel like ideas should not be paid at all. Such type of philosophy can exterminate any incentive to create something beautiful and share it.
Making pirate copies leads to huge money loss in current time, so it should be prohibited and punished. Giving free music and fims constantly forms a free-rider problem and certain beliefs, that can become moral hazards in the future.

It goes with out saying, that it is very difficult to find job in developing countries. This situation helps to take up the rate of living in such countries. More than that businesses provide their locations with support with some parts of life like medicine, education. Besides, it seems to me that with a good life, countries begin to think about developing ther own situaition. On other we can not ignore disadvantages of this theme. When businesses prefer to give job for local workers they leave people from their country without. It is clearly that workers from other countries are more cheaper than from their own ones, but they can do work worse than their native people. d anThat is why the quality suffers. Further more, such cases can be a reason to unemployment in countries and can cause to low standard of living.

Should universities do it? I'm sure that they don't do it and there are two main reasons of this: an own choice and a problem for universities.
The first reason, why universities should not acept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is that students should do their own choice without any opinions and restrictions. If a student wants to study a subject , where there is not a place for him or her, so it is problem. She or he can't to get a good education , because she or he don not get a place for studying. For example, last year my brother dod not get a place in subject, which he wanted to study , and now he don not enjoy studying absolutely.
The second reason why I do'not agree with the topic is that, if universities should accept equal members, so it can make some problems. For instance, there are situations , when a lot of students want to study one subject , and other small group of students wants to study other subjects, so problem is how to destingrush places of subjects equally. It is necessary to understand that it should be fair.

On one hand, there are a lot of moral norms of behaviour and freedom of this. Sometimes artists have to show some disgusting things or art objects and it can have an bad impact on mental health of the viewer. Films, painting may have a lot of violence or sex scence and that may have negative effect on children or people with weak mental health. There was an accident in Moskow where the artist was naked on the Red Square. Not everyone is ready to watch this kind of art expression.


On the other hand there are a lot of new bright art ideas that can lead to the great inventions. Like no one was ready to the cinema and brothers Lumiere thought that cinema art has no future, but right now it is a power industry. So if brothers were supposed to close there little cinemas by government restriction, we would not be able to watch films right now. So the new ideas and the ways to design them should have no restrictmens.


The solution is to have special comitet with independent people, that are very educated artists and are famous and known. They would be able to give right permittions for audience, that is able to watch something shoking. Also, they would be able to support new inventions in art and spred them in the world.


To sum up there is nessesary to keep freedom in art but to control the information  about content and it influence on the views. There should be warnings and relevant explanation of complicated art.

On the other hand, some people drink alcohol and smoke a lot, but they live for a long time. Not everyone who has bed habits live for 60 or more years, of course.

Do we have to take care? Or we should do what we want? To my mind, we should do morning exercises, try to help other people, eat healthy food. But sometimes can eat unhealthy products: crisps, cola, dishes with salt and papper.  If our body want something we should eat or do it.

Many people advocate the view that such kind of stimulating fusical activity should be limited and the person should not be involved in competitions for about 2 years,
Others think that in this case the atllet should end his career. I personally think that illegal drugs are enormously harmfull for our health and athlets should avoid such a sticky situations when somebody says that they used them. There were some cases when people had not very popular illneses and used some leagal drugs to deal with this promblem. But the test showed that this medicine was not allowed. In such case it will be trully unfair to banne this person forever. I'll ruin his life. Moreover, professional sportsman should gain some qualities to choose a different profession. It will take a lot of time to find another working field and improve some skills. Opponents argue that using illegal drugs may destroy your organism from inside. To avoid it, people should always be afraid to lose all the main thing they have in life more than become better than others. So it will be a great example of how you shouldn't act if someone is banned for the rest of the life. Also it will help other competitors to take part in honest competition and the drugs test can insure them.
In conclusion I would like to say that all people should have a second chance. There is a tendency that a person who made a significant mistake should have some time to overthink it and develop the way how to prevent the same situations in the future. Two years is more than enough to do your best and change the life priorities.

It can be seen from the chart that social networks for entertaining are more popular among young people, meanwhile LinkedIn, which is used for looking for job, is used more by people of middle age and older.

Taking into consideration each separate network following things could be mentioned. Firstly, only about 22 per cent of people from 18 to 29 use it and it's the same for people, who are over 60. Moreover, the percentage doesn't rise significantly over the middle age group, who are people from 30-49 and 50-64, and is only about 30 per cent. Secondly, there is a huge amount of Facebook users in the US and it reached almost 90 per cent, and the lowest point is the percentage of pensioners that is about 56 per cent. The same tendency can be noticed about Instagram, that it's more used among 18-29 years old people and the older the group age is the less the amount of people using it.

Firstly, I want to analyze date of opening. The oldest underground railway system is in London, it was opened in IXX century, in 1863. What about the newest underground railway system from our six cities, it is located in Los Angeles and was opened in XXI century, in 2001. It is the only URS (underground railway system) from our table that was opened in XXI century. Other Underground railway system I want to write in order of date opened: Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC and Kyoto URS, so they were opened in 1900. 1927, 1976 and finally 1981. Now about kilometres of route. The smallest and shortest URS is situated in Kyoto, Japan with nearly 11 kilometres of route. The biggest and the longest URS is in London with 394 kilometres of route. Other URS I will write in order of biggering: Los Angeles, Washington, Tokyo and Paris with 11, 126, 155 and 199 kilometres of route. It is interesting that older URS is longer. However, there is an exception: LA URS is longer than Kyoto URS despite the fact that LA URS is younger than Kyoto URS.  
Finally I will analyze passangers per year (in millions). The biggest number of passangers per year is in Tokyo with 1927 millions people per year. The lest number is in the shortest URS, in Kyoto, with 45 millions per year. Other numbers are: 50, 144, 775 and 1191 millions per year in LA, Washington DC, London and Paris.

But also they can find pirate copies and get for free. Some people think that this is crime and pirates have to be punished. Others tells that art have to be free.
In my opinion, pirates moves all industry of music and cinema forward. For example the huge part of teenagers have no money to buy hundreds of songs and albums. But when they have chance to get it for free they find their favourite bands, songs and give chance for unknown musiciants become famous. There are thousands examples of bands who gives their music for free, they find it like a way to introduce their art to huge auditory Anyway the main part of musician money is money from tickets, that means if more people will hear you, more people will come to the show and band will get more money.
That’s how pirates help bands and whole industry. The only chance for groups to make a lot of money is to make good music and great shows. Also I like the Idea how Apple solve problems with pirates, they make all music on Apple music free, but enter for month costs some money, this is one more way to overcome problem.
In the end I would like to say that there are a lot of ways win over the pirates and punishing is not one of them.

It is because of nobody can clearly explain is and suggest ways how how to achieve this. However, there can be some problems which are connected with difficulties and some factors whic are important in achievening this feeling.
There is an arguement that defining happiness is inconpenenseble. Personaly I think that the main difficulty is misunderstanding of hapiness. People don’t know what the want! Basically hapiness is entirely about privacy. To find its meaning and understand their wishes, a lot of people try to do something new, change their mind and lifestyle or even fall in love or make new friends. Essentially, view of the hapiness are dissimilar. In other words some people find happinesse in their family, however others prefer to be alone. There are a lot of examples, but overall, everyone want to know a magical way how to reach happiness.
From my point of view it depends only on the person, his character. Behaviour and desires. Some people probably have a consideration that money as the majoc factor that provides hapiness. So, according to these desire, people are encouraged to have a great job which erandies to pay them a high salary. They believe that wealth will fulfill their dreams.
Nevertheless, others think that health is the most valuable factor. In addition, love is the main and necessary aspect which can make people happy.
To sum up. There are some pros abd cons about the real happiness. I believe that only a mix of all aspects brings people the unlimited happiness.

I think those people should be restricted.
First of all, when someone create some contant, that is his own privicy. Then, that men should be regarded for his work. The money he will get will be used for creating of new content For example the sifted musician created alboum, and his music is highly rated, people like it. But, author donot get any money for his alboum, and he lose incentive to create next part. People will be inable to listen the another alboum, becouse they did’t pay for first alboum and just downloaded it for free.
Secondly, the coping of infornation without payment is restricted by law If people do not consider that law necessery, the other laws will not have any sence for them. For example, that will lead to anarchy and life will be worse. More over, illigal coping stops develonment of culture. Musicians dont wand to create anythig becouse it will be stolen. Society will degrodate
To sum up, illigal coping of fillms and music and films make danger not only for creators but for consumers too. Also that stops development of our society. and causes its degradation.

Both points of view are aceptable and now we are going to discuss them.
First of all, there are too many sport scandals and the major part of them are conected with illegal drugs. International organisations try to overcome them and the basic method is banneding atheletes for 2 years. It is believed that after this period they will be free and clear and will not any aftermaths. Eventually sportsmen can continue their careers.

Also it is not esential to discualificate athelets for the rest of teir lives, because they participates in competitions and do sports from the shildhood. Sport is the sense of their lives.

A lot of people use this opportunity not to pay. Some people believe that such dishonest people should be punished whereas others suggest that they just act rationally.
It seems that there is a real rational part in this kind of behaviour. Because of full access to this sort of information, which people are usually interested in, they sometimes do not have any thoughts about illegal side of what they are doing. They believe that they just download a song, when it can be called committing a crime, judging by the law. That is the reason why these people should not be punished. Their aim is not connected with illegal actions at all.
From the other point of view, we can come up with the decision that people who leak such information are criminals as their main purpose is not download a film and spend their evening sitting on a sofa watching it and just having a good time. They do release music and video and help them to be spread. They hack special services and steal the content. Maybe this is a kind of some strike, as these hackers believe that if they have an opportunity to get music and video for free because of skills, they also can spread it and help other people not to pay.
Anyway people are more likely to watch and listen to pirate copies for entertainment. They do not really care about the law. when downloading a film. It is more a problem of education as we do not realise that our actions are illegal in these moments and we should be better taught to feel more sure about things we are doing to keep safe.
To sum it all up, it is necessary to say that it really depends, while talking about punishment. It can be a good idea to become more strict, but, firstly, people should become informed about illegal part of these actions.

Do we have at least one way to reduce crime? Let us think about it.

Many people think the best way to increase crime is to give longer prison sentences. From my point of view, it is not a great idea. If person have courage to do some wrong ations he\she do it. Poople who think about crime know that they will be punishment. And for them there is no difference how mach time they will spend in the prison.
I strongly believe, that the only fear of the death can reduce the crime. All people afraid of it. If The person knows that punishment for his actions is death, he will do everything to avoid it. Moreover, there will no possibility to leave a prison earlier. It will be a magnificent ""lesson"" for everyone who do not think about rights of other peopel and laws.

They spent their own money on dresses, dicorations and other special equipment. When pirate copies are on the Internet, artists do not have money that were earned by them. Besides, sometimes musicians and film producers can lose a huge ammount of their fans. It is quite easier for audience to stay at home and not to go to the show. Moreover, others singers could say that this song is belonging to them and in the future it will be difficult to find the truth.

Finally, in my opinion, I believe that people who make pirate copies should be punished because they do not have any rights to use the original content for their own perposes. People who want to see a new film or hear a new song can go to the concert or wait for several years.

While some people consider long sentences to be the solution, others insist that there are more efficient ways to achieve same goals. This essay will analyze both points of view and give supporting reasons. Putting a person a jail is one of the oldest ways of punishing law- breakers and it is still widely used in many countries of the world. A lot of people think that longer sentences would prevent others to commit new crimes because they would have to spend the rest of their life in prison. Nevertheless, there is a study which shows that there is no strong  correlation between length of sentences and level of crime. Mostly, it is happening because there are a lot of other reasons of crime like level of unemployment, low quantity of life and lack of education. That is why people started to reconsider their approach to reducing crime level. Evidently, it requires complex improvement pf citizens life. First, government should create more job opportunities so people could find a legal way to earn a better living. Second, teachers at schools should carefully explain the reasons why children must not bypass the law. Finally, authorities could spend more money on police force to prevent crime in the beginning. Despite the fact that longer prison sentences could slightly reduce level of crime, I believe there are better solution for that problem which are already apllied in some countries and they are showing much higher efficiency, and I hope they would be integrate worldwide in the nearest future, which would benefit the society.

However, some people strongly disagree with this point of view as they think that these changes will have too little effect on the level of public health. To my mind, increasing of amout of sports facilities can be an important step to achievement of good health of our society.
Firstly, I would like to say that some people can not affort themselves doing sports because of the price which facilities are sold by. If the new facilities will be cheaper, lots of people would have been able to do sports. As a result, more people will be physically stronger as well as prepared to difficult work.
Moreover, increasing of sport facilities such as water pools will led to increasing of people doing water sports in our society. Doing water sports not only a type of fun but even a good physical practice thats why it can help to reduce amount of heart desiases.
On the other hand, one can say that there are different ways to improve health of modern people. For example, our government should spend more money on growing heathy vegetables and fruits because our food can make as stronger if it does not contain poisoning substances. Delivery of healthy products to all people is important at present, when approximately all people prefer to eat junk food.
To sum up, I would like to say that it is both important to increase number of sports facilities as well as to do other steps to protect people from deseases and illnesses.

Firstly, from my point of view, copying and sharing music or films breaks the private property rule but, in my opinion, the main reason why do people do illegally, is that the price for songs and films is too high. For example, computer game “Fifa 17” costs over 2500 roubles, which is too much for a game. So, if the producers want to get more money, they should cut the prices, which will increase the demand on illegal production. So, I think, that punishing people is too strict because there are checks and balances which are able to solve this problem of pirate copies.
Secondly, I suppose that the other matter is that the internet-security is working not effective enough. It is so because we can all view that all these pirate programmes have a free access. If the state would have taken more actions in these aspects, we, just, couldn’t have found these files which would have lead to buying license disks because this would have been the only source. So, as a result, the prices would stay on the same level and the demand will be realning new peats. This way helps to increase amounts or creators monty and at the same time it is not quiet radical because there is no necessity to punish people.
In conclusion, I would like to say that this problem is very difficult and the interests of civilians and businesmen are both important and the ways which were described earlier present themselves a compromise between too radical decisions.

Each election they appeal to their electorate's pre-existing opinions to manipulate them into voting for ""the good guys"". In this particular case, the opinion seems to be that it's all the young'uns fault, and that back in the day things were different.

That premise is partially true, of course. Young people do commit more crimes than the mature and elderly. The reason for that is younger people are generally less experienced, and it's perfectly natural for them to drink and drive, act before they think, or to simply succumb to their natural violent urges. Hardcore criminals either get weeded out by natural selection, give up, or get smart and don't get caught anymore. This is how it's been for hundreds of years, this is how it is now, and this is how it'll remain, unless Earth becomes a planet-wide police state.

Parents and teachers are less help to the already-damaged people than they think. Empirical evidence suggests that parents are generally lousy guardians that don't have the first idea about raising a wholesome individual, and teachers are desperate incompetent nags that further distance the youth from self-improvement and healthy self-actualization. The most important thing for parents to do would be to not procreate until they know what to do with their offspring. The teachers can also rethink their career choices unless they are decent people.

So, there are different views on this problem and its possible solution.
Some people believe that only by increasing the amount of sports facilities public health will reach the higher level. Of course, doing sport every day may have a positive influence on person's health. Nowadays it is seemed to be that people do not have enough time for any sports activities due to very stressful and crazy lifestyle. They are so exhausted after work that they prefer a passive rest, like watching TV or simply liying on a sofa. In this case, people need to move actively for being healthy.
On the other hand, there is an opposite opinion saying that the increasing number of sport facilities is not the best way to solve such problem. The argument is that not all the people are able to do sport and have efficient time for it. So, it should be done something more for improving public health.
Personally, I agree with the opposite point of view because I believe that most of people will not be encouraged and motivated to do sport, if the government offers more sports facilities. I think that people should focus not only on sport but also be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle. They should eat more vegetables, fruits and meat accept of sweets and junk food. Also it is possible to reach their, for example, workplaces not using private cars but going there by feet.

However, there are arguments on whether the sportsmen who were caught cheating this way should be banned from competing for the whole lives or just for some time. There are both advantages and disadvantages in those ways of dealing with this problem.
First of all, we should keep in mind that spotsmen, especially young ones, can be influenced by their coaches. That is why young athlets should be educated and taughted by their parents not to take any medications from others without talking to parents.

Moreover, come people claim that the drugs found in some sportsmens blood are not drugs, but just medications, which are necessary for those athlets health.
However, all those points are not easily checked and some people say those points cannot be used as an excuse for taking prohibited medications.

There are many people wo earn a livelihood by selling pirate copies and they still haven’t been punished. But at the same time, there are many people of art industry who become victims of ‘media’ pirates. I will describe my opinion in the paragraphs below. 

First of all, I absolutely agree that it is sort of a crime to copy and share music or films or any kind of media on the internet without permission of the owner. There should be a special rule for that issue. To my mind, government should stricky prohibit internet thefts. 

Secondly, the reason why people downloade pirate copies is that generally usual internet users don’t see any crime in it. So, government should pay a lot of attention to promote spreading of legal copies. We have seen some faint attemptions to promote legal copies via TV commercials but to me it is not enough. Usual internet users should not be punished for downloading pirate copies because sometimes it is the only way to get a very expensive and rare computer programs for free. However, conscientious, pirates  should be punished because they do a serious act of crime. 

Speaking about worldwide experience, Hollywood movie makers have been working so hard to stop pirate copies. They put a lot of effort to prohibit illegal copying. They have a lot of rules that have been supported by the government. But sometimes rules don’t work in the way they are supposed to. For example, recently there has been a pirate copy of new Sherlock Holmes series on the internet. Even director didn’t know how that happened. It means that sometimes there should be drastic measures to avoid the spread of illegal copies. 

In conclusion, I think that it is fairly important to provide safe spread of movies or music and support legal copies. We have to fight with thefts and respect piece of art.

The first thing to note is that in the period from 1940 to the early 1990s lines responsible for population in America and Sweden followed the similar pattern. Then the number of Swedish citizens of this age category is expected to experience a sudden rise from approximately 14% to 20%, afterwards there may be a slight fall, but in mid 2020s figures probably go up again.

With regards to songs and movies there are the same rules to which technologies and material results of ideas obey: they should be paid. Therefore, any means that help to avoid respecting the creator’s right must be limited.
Nevertheless, even some authors, musicians and filmmakers, consider it acceptable to share and distribute their arts for free. As a rule, they have a definite target – to tell the world about existence of their music and films and consequently become famous. For those the Internet is an ideal way to find fans and followers.

I suppose, that Inlernet pirats should be punished and I will give my arguements in the essay.
Firstly, it is known that people of art usually earn money by selling copies of their discs with films and songs. It is written on each copy, that people could not copy and share this product without special rights. In whole world this activity is illegal. In the era of the Ynternet it became very difficult to control the situation with authors right, that is why the punishment should become more strictly for this type of theft.
There is no way of developing in art industry, while internet pirates will share their pirate copies of songs and film, becouse authors and producers will have no money to create and record new cd’s or to make new films. It is believed very often that songs and films are very expensive and coast much more than they should really coast, however there is no one person who try to get an expensive car for free just becouse it cost too much in his opinion.
To conclusion, any theft should be punished, becouse of many reasons. Copying and sharing products of art on the Inlernet is very easy, but it leads to degradation of industry. There will be no economical stimules to produce new films or to write songs if it will not be good authors law in the country.

These troubles are different and they appear approximately everyday. The best way to solve the problem is to investigate the cause of the problem and then find some ways of the solution.

In my opinion there are two main causes of these problem and they are very complicated. The first cause is obviously a family, the behaviour of the child depends on a situation in family. If a person grows up in a good conditions with care and love, the person will behave adequatelly. Another important thing is the explanation about good and bad things to a child. And if the person grows up in the conditions of eternal argues, offending words and without wise teachings, the person’s behaviour will be too bad. I grew up at the outskirts of the city, so I studied at school with a lot of children, who had some problems in family.

The second problem is the lack of discipline at school. Discipline goes from a family, but it can be changed at school. Nowadays the problems with discipline are at least everywhere and teachers don’t know how to improve the poor situation. It is really difficult but possible to make discipline better.

The situation in family can’t be changed somehow at all, because it goes from father to son with methods and traditions. So if the family is good, it will be good all the time and if it is bad, it will always be bad. But the situation with lack of discipline can be changed with a lot of ways. The best one is punishment. Schools should be able to have a permission to punish their students for bad behaviour and after few punishments a student undoubtely will understand the things he did wrong.

To sum up I want to say that the problem with student behaviour is very important and complicated and some ways to solve this problem must be found as soon as possible.

Personally, I believe that a number of female and male students must be equal in the majority of universities. What is better for universities, to have equal numbers of people of the same gender, is a controversial issue worth discussing.
It is often argued that the proportion of male students should be equal to the proportion of girls. Firstly, it would be perfect, if every boy can talk with another girl. The result would be the following: every student has a lot of attention and communication to his person. Secondly, a teacher can practice his or her sociable skills in order to get on well with the students of both genders.
In addition, some parents think that a faculty with an equal number of girls and boys is a good opportunity for their daughters and sons to get married. If a male student manages to have excellent relationships with a female student in university, then in the future she will have a brilliant chance to become his wife. Moreover, at present the women are fewer than men. So it can cause the decrease of the population in the case if a number of girls are bigger. The demografic situation can be worse because of this fact.
Nowadays it is a very important question which depends on the opinion of everyone. I consider that it is much better when all universities can have an equal number of the students of the both genders on every faculty because all students become more sociable due to communication with each other and because it can effect demografic situation in a positive way.

The difference between North America and South Africa in the number of unemployees is 8,6 per cent (12,5 per cent and 3,9 per cent respectively). There were no any changes in these regions as in worldwide to. Both in 2014 and 2015 worldwide unemployment rate reached 5,9 per cent.

Middle East and Latin America had similar situations: there was small decrease which was not under 2 per cent (in the first case it was only 1,4 and in the second case - 2). Only in countries of EU was some increase: the rate went up by 0,4 per cent to reach 7,9 per cent.

The first point I would like to touch upon is the fact, that many people use air travel in order to rexal more, or work more; because mostly of us want to save their time. Some people air journey for work, and airplanes help to go more faster, than train. I think, that it is better to scientist make less bad oil for airplanes, in order to not contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Government should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.
On the other hand, many people think that it is very important to protect our planet. Of course, they are right. Decrease the amount of air travel for business and leasure alow us to safe Earth. Governments and introducing laws can help in it. Many people travel very often. Airplannes fly very often, so our air maked more bad and dark, but we can help each other in order to live with fresh air.
In conclusion I want to say that it is important - to protect planet on which we live, and it is possible to reduce the amount air travel for business and leasure. But 	I think that there is no need to ban it and decrease the amount of flying, because it is convenient for people and it makes our travels simply.

First for all we have to decide for yourself is the process of globalization good or bad. If there are more pros than cons, we should admite the negative side of globalization, like the air pollution as a fact, which can not be totally solved. And now turning to globalization process, in my opinion it has more pros than cons: I am an international student and I have to use aircraft to go to my home country. While the process to globalization is developing, the aviatickets become more more cheeper, which allows me to bye them. If the government decides to reduce the number of air travels, we could see the demand on air travel will dramatically increase. It will leed to that fact, that the aviatickets become more expensive, which cannot be bought by ordinary people. It will be the example of social inequality, which will influence negatively on government reputation. In conclusion, I think that the air pollution a not subject of an issue, because cars produce much more polute gases than anything else, by the way. Governments shouldn’t introduce laws of remove the amount of using polute machines, however governments may influence on technology side. For example, to develop and implement laws, which don’t allow people to use vey polute machines. Laws have to represent standart of allowed pollution. To sum up, governments shouldn’t implement tough measures to solve this problem, but have to implicate modern methods and economic instruments in order to make producing of pollution rather expensive, that it will not damage environment like in present times.

Personally, I'm sure artists have to be given freedom in self-expression. This essay will analyze why it is the only possible way.


Firstly, really creative people have been known from times immemorial as not only artists, but as individuals who look far in the future, bring truth to people and inspire them to change the world to the better, so they need to be heard.


Secondly, any government restrictions can not make a true artist silent. His poems, music or films may become even more wide spread then before due to intake instinct of people to be free, in reading or watching something as well, and restrictions will only stimulate people's interest to creations of the artist. Our country experienced it in 20 century.


However, there is a belief that independence in creating of any art form has bad consequences. Artists are not saints, and some of their works sometimes include immoral content, which spoils person's spiritual world. Moreover, such art can influence people to bring harm to society.


All things considered, I believe the positives of giving freedom to artists outweigh its drawbacks. Art is pure in its nature, if a person is a true artist, his works will only benefit the society, and the question who can be considered as a true artist is another issue to discuss.

However, it can be seen the totally different pattern for food production. Only 11% of products are transported by rail whereas 30% of these goods are transported by road. In addition, machinery which is transported by rail exceed machinery transported by road al,ost by 10%.

Overall, the majority of metals and machinery is transported by rail. Nevertheless the biggest percentage of food production is transported by road.

The question is how to provide it and many people suppose the increasing the number of sport facilities to be the best solution. On the one hand, sport facilities will be helpful for people of all generations. It is possible to find special type of sport for every age and health group. It can be extra classes in schools or universities, free sport centres or special equipment in parks: sport facilities can be provided by many ways and for everybody. Moreover, sport is not only the way to protect the health but also the type of communication. Providing more places for sport facilities government finds not only the solution for improving public health, but also create new options for spending spare time. For example, there is such practice in China where old people communicate with each other doing sport exercises in parks. On the other hand, it is impossible to make everyone doing sport. Of course, increasing the number of sports facilities will provide more interest to sport among people, but this process can not be controlled. Other measures, such as free vactination can be more efficient, but require more government spendings. Moreover, sport exercises can be harmful for people, who do not know the techniques and his or her own restrictions. In this situation sport gives negative effect. To sum up, I hold the view that increasing the number of sport facilities can give lots of benefits to society and increase the level of health in the country. There are cheap ways of providing it that can make the whole humanity healthier.

But how strict should be the punishment for being unfair? Let us discuss the problem of illegal drugs, where some people claim that the people who use illegal drugs should be banned from the professional competition temporarily, while the others argue that they should be banned permanently.
Personally, I think that there can be no excuse for cheating in the professional sports competition, especially if it is very important, for example, world championship, or olympic games, that is why i think that people who use illegal drugs should be banned for the rest of their lives.
Firstly, the temporary bans, will not be much of a reason for the sportsmen to not to use drugs, because after the time is gone they will continue their career as if this situation never took place before. It is obvious for me that many of them tried to use drugs at least once, just to see what happens. Only the complete ban from the future professional competition will solve the problem, as it will encourage fear of using drugs among the sportsmen.
However, many of the people will disagree with this opinion. They will argue that the complete ban from future professional competition will sometimes result in misjudment and spoiled careeres for the sportsmen. The complete ban from the professional competition is too severe to be a solution in their opinion.
Nevertheless, I cannot agree with their opinion. Misjudgement is a part of every law and can happen any time, no matter how strict are the laws themselves. If a person is misjudged somehow, he can prove his innocence, and the lack of evidence can also be a reason for innocence.
In conclusion, I would like to say that sport is a sport and it must be fair. There can be no place for illegal drugs and for people who try to use them in their own interest.

Some of this problems are very serious, some of them can be easily reduced. 

The most common problem for people nowadays is the lack of mobility. We spend a great part of the day sitting by our computers. People who work sit near the computer almost 8 hours without even getting up. Even students who are supposed to be healthy and active suffer from this problem. To reduce this issue, special exercises brakes can be introduced in offices, maybe even in universities and schools. It is crucial to have some resting time during work and studying, but it’s also important for this break to be helpful physically and mentaly. And of course let’s not forget about the healthy diet a person should have and the importance of staying hidrated. 

Another problem that is discussed a lot today is peoples’ dependence on mobile phones and the internet.  A lot of my friends agree that they can’t live without  their phones. The constant need of communication and information stays behind that. However, I think that sometimes we need to have some tome for ourselves. Therefore one of the ways of dealing with this particular problem would be meditation. It is an easy way to relax and ger yourself together, clear  your head from all the unnecessary information that comes to us everyday. In my opinion, this is a great habbit everybody can develop. 

To conclude, I can say that despite the fact that we live in a world  full of modern technology, we shouldn’t be lazy and we shouldn’t forget to take care of our personal health.

These persons are needed for permanent freedom in order to display their talent. There musn't be any penalties for their expressions, because any kind of art considers to be a masterpiece and not contains and violence or unpleasant thing.
First, the every idea, providing by an artist provides a very deep phylosophy.  Every picture we see in museum or film we are watching is an artist's sending for us. The master want to teach us, to transfer their own experience and thoughts. Each idea is like a sign for the humanity, which we can not reject.
Second, numerous masterpieces form the culture of every country. It makes each country unic, glorious and bright. Maintaining of artist's masterpieces, in my opinion, is one of the most important goals of a government. They should carefully preserve their artists, making them all conditions for good work. For example, we have great number examples of brilliant poets, who leaved our country and lived in Europe and USA, in case of terrible restrictions of the Stalin's government in 1920 - 1930s.
Third, every artist's idea is only way to say what he think. Nowadays, we are leaving in modern democratic society, which means freedom for art expressions, too. Neither picture or poem, each peace of art is a unic person's idea, which all of us should respect. Disrispect of person's thoughts may lead to totalitarian policy system, in which all people will suffer.
Finally, we must undertand the importance of art in our life. Art is that thing, which makes us wise, maintain our intelligence and literacy and simply makes us true man. Art can teach us how to live, how to survive and how to respect all people around us. Thus, There no place for any restriction of any kind of art.

There are considered to be two points of view on the banning of such sportsmen, who got caught on taking drugs to enhance their abilities.
On the one hand, some people think, that the punishment shouldn't be so crucial. Many people come with the opinion of banning such sportsmen from professional competition up to two years. This should be very adecuate punishment for that kind of sportsmen, who got caught for the first time. In that case that kind of restrictiont could prevent the further dopping scandales and not to crush the whole professional life of the spotsman.
On the other hand, there are a common opinion, that athletes, who use illegal drugs, should be banned for the rest of their lives. That kind of opinion, as for me, sounds too cruel. But to justify the competition, it should relate to that athlete, who was caught more than once. Otherwise, there is no point in the competition itself, when the human can't concquer on equal with others.
In my opinion, nowadays we have another case in this dopping stuff. Sometimes the political issues play a great role in orders of punishment, not looking on the societie's opinion. Recently, the commitee of world sports decides how they will punish one athelete or the whole team. That's why the main purpose is to reach the justice in the process of restrictions and then judge what this restriction will be.

Indeed, such a statement has its grounds with the issue being immensely serious. Undoubetly, it needs to be addressed as soon as possible. This essay will explore some of the causes of the problem and several feasible solutions to it.

One of the most common reasons for such a development is the lack of parents' attention to children while they grow up. Nowadays, parents tend to work hard in order to achieve a stable financial situation which leads to them paying less attention to their kids and passing the burden of upbringing to the educational system. The most obvious solution in this case is raising awareness of such a problem in society and propagating more responsable parenting in schools and on the media by teachers.

Another very hazardous causes of such high teen crime rates is the lack of control over children in schools and other educational institutions. Today, the main function of a teacher is not mentoring a student but simply passing some information. It has to change with teachers becoming more responsible for moral health of the kids they teach.
Finally, last but not least ground for the phenomenon to appear is the general decrease of moral standarts in society which leads to children becoming less responsible for their actions. A great solution in this case is spreading higher moral code through various media like the Internet and television. In this situation, teachers and parents are the one help children find out about what is good and what is bad.

All things considered, the issue of teenage crimes is tremendously serious. However, the reasons of it are more detrimental to society than the actual phenomenon itself as their development might lead to more social chaos. There are several solutions to the problem and as soon as school, government, and parents are aware of them and of the problem, it will be possible to successfully tackle the issue.",65,2,0

Firstly, I agree that this is a big problem in these industries. Let’s start from fact that I’m a huge fan of music and cinema. Usually, I’m buying music on I-tunes, or in any other internet shop. And of course, usually I am going to the cinema, with mu friends, or with my girlfriend or maybe even solo. So It’s normal for me to spend money for these kinds of entertainment. And I understand that my money are very important for musician and producers, But on the other hand, I have two examples. First – I have been known a lot of people, who is not able to spend money for this. It’s people whose life is harder than mine in many ways, especially in financial possibilities. And I understand them extremely well, when they downloading ‘illegal’ copies of films in the Internet. And I have an example of my father. He is a musician, and I know very well, that outcome of public concerts in many times bigger, than a little percentage of disk sales, because the main part of it goes to producers. So I prefer to separate musicians and producers. And as my opinion, amount of money losing is highly overrated. Financially successful films always have a good outcome, despite of any factors. So problem is very overrated.

Another vital problem is obesity. Nowadays people become less and less active because of various means of transport or distant entertainment such as Internet.

Conserning to the point of view closly linked with the statement that punishment for discribed crimes must be banning from competing professionally during the period of whole life.

The other countries, where the unemployment rate remain the same were S.Asia and other countries Worldwide, that were not in this chart. The lowest level of unemployment was in S.Asia (3,9%). However, it also stabilized during these two years. In Middle East in 2014 the level of unemployment reached 11% and then in 2015 decreased to 9,6%.

Despite the fact that most of them are allowed by world sport society and Internationals sports organizations, some of them remains illegal, and, unfortunately, this fact sometimes doesn't stop sportsmen and their coaches to use it. That's why some people believe that such sportsmen should be disqualified forever. However, others argue that temporary ban is suitable for such situatons. In this essay both of these points of view will be discussed.
First group of people postulate that sportsmen must be banned for a long time, even forever. They explain his by the fact that sportsmen should not use any drugs to achieve goals and trainings is the only one variant. ""If person can not compete using honest way, why we should call him ""sportsman""?"", they claim. Besides, if sportsman was caught once there is no confidence that this situation will not repeat.
Others tell that ban for a whole life is too strict measure. Prohibition for doing sports for a couple of years should charge sportsmen's mind, they think. Moreover this version says that there are a lot of anti doping systems and organizations, which rather correctly manage situation with illegal drugs.
My opinion is close to the second variant, because I believe that most of sportsmen who have been caught after using illegal drugs did this for the last time. However, we should be strict in some way to such sportsmen and take away all their awards and trophies which have been taken in ""doping"" period.
To conclude it should be noted that the are a lot of variants how to punish unhonest sportsmen, but we should do this using rational approach.

I strongly disagree with this statement, as other factors should be considered during application.
To start with, the level of education is the most important factor of future students. That is why, school marks and examinations results have to be taken into account. Consequently, if there are more men with high exams marks than women, there is no reason for accepting the equal quantity of male and female students.
Moreover, some occupations are so specific that it would be hard to teach men and women to work at these jobs. For instance, girls are more likely to become nurses than boys, but it is hard to work with steel or oil for them.
However, there is another point of view. Some people are sure that we have to provide the equal rights for both sexes in the process of university attendance. Their main argument cannot be taken into consideration, because giving the same rights to people has to be linked with providing the best opportunities for people who are more talanted and eager to achieve the success in their lives.
In conclusion I can say that I cannot agree with the opinion that universities have to accept equal quantities of male and female applicants. I strongly believe that other factors are more crusial than person’s sex, such as his or her knowledge and professional qualities.

It is claimed that piracy is a real theft and people should be punished for it. Surely, musicians and producers suffer from the internet piracy, but I also believe that the internet is a zone of free exchange.

On the one hand, it is an obvious fact that even music of films in the internet have their creators. Everybody can say about their authority and prove it juridically. For example, each legally working internet source would delete your music or other product of your intellectual work if you ask for it. Furthermore, each cultural object and each worker of this area deserve respectance. It is normal for people to get money for their job. And if the only way to sell the project is downloading it to in the internet source, people should understand that sharing it in the illegal way is wrong and unfair.

On the other hand, the internet i famous for its freedom. Nobody can be arrested while doing something anonymously. That is why the piracy can be understood. Moreover, it can be mentioned that internet music and films are not material objects and sometimes people just can not believe that they should pay for something they could not touch.

To sum up, internet piracy is disrespective illegal action, but the main advantage of internet is that it is a zone of free exchange, so producers and authors should learn to work with this knowledge.

However, number of users of Linked In is significantly decreased, in a comparison with two other social networks.
Facebook figures steadily decreased with the increasing of the age. Instagram also has the same tendency, nevertheless, its fall goes in a spectacular way.

Some people think that sportsmen that use drugs should not be able to compete in professional sport for a few years, while others think that they should be banned from competing for good. I will try to discuss both views and express my own opinion.
On the one hand athlets that using illegal drugs are frauds. By using medicine that can help you to gain weight, become stronger sportsmen prevent their teammates from getting good results and achievements. Banning such people from sport for a limited period, acompanied with public judgment, can be very effective in preventing further incidents.
On the other hand, there are few precedents known to a history of using illegal drugs not once but regularly. Those sportsmen that do not respect not just other athletes, but coaches, some legendary figures, fans or the whole country that will suffer from judgement and humiliation do not deserve to present their nation on competitons for the rest of their lives. These will also be a good example for those who think about starting using drugs: your stupidity can end your career, and the whole life.
In my opinion, using illegal medicine is definitely a problem nowadays. But there are few points I would like to underline. Firstly, some athletes are in need of some medicine to reduce pain, for example, but a lot of drugs that contain illegal components. Such athletes' casss should be doubl-checked before making statements. Secondly, sportsmen that have been already caugh should be checked more often.
To conclude, such serious problem can be fixed not necessary by banning and ruining career of good sportsmen but through serious investigation and testing that will help to prevent such things.

Some people think, it will be right if proportions are similar to each other. I disagree with this opinion. I guess there isn’t a big necessity in it.
First of all, to make equal numbers of boys and girls at university is impossible. Because all universities have different directions and faculties. Boys prefer one speciality, girls are another: they choose direction which is interesting for them and useful for their future. That’s why proportion can’t be equal. There is stereothyp that men like math and women like humanity science.
Secondly, I’m sure that there is not a big necessity to accept equal proportion because it is not important how many male and female students will be, more serious how. They will communicate wth each other, and study there. They should be serious and educated people despite of proportion.
There is a positive side of this question. Equal proporion of girls and boys will show equal right of all genders. But I’m not sure that there are a lot of people, who cares of it.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that, of course, maybe equal numbers of male and female students will help to avoid some different conflicts, but I’m sure that it’s not important how many boys and girls, it is more important that they have a great desire for studying and be friendly with each other.

Since the days of ancient theaters in Greece people seek joy in all kinds of arts. Unfortunately, with the spread of world wide web illegal copying of music and movies became availiable. Many people avoid paying charges for things they can get for free.

On the one hand, there should not be any special rules and laws for web-crime. On-line stealing and shoplifting have the same nature. A disk from a music store is as valuable as song on the internet. Thus, people who leave a shop with a disk in a pocket should be punished in the same way as those who download music from pirate web-sites. Some people would argue that they are more comfortable with wathching movies at home rather than going to cinema theater. However, there are plenty of sources that offer films for wathching movies at home and at the same time do not violate the law. 

This serveces provide good-quality content with a smaller fee than in cinemas.

On the other hand, punishment is not the best solution to the problem of online-stealing. In some countries ethics play bigger role than laws. It could be more reasonable to make social advertisments that would cover this problem or explain kids in scools why it is wrong to avoid charges. For example, in the USA downloading a free movie may cause public shaming. Meanwhile in Russia you will considered to be a vierd person. if you suggest you friends to pay for a movie in online-cinema, eventhoug there is a low that forbides doing that.

Overall, such problem as pirate web copies exists not because there are no law restrictions but as societie’s moral standarts do not provide a guidance on this occasion. Thus, making punishments more strckt would be worthless.

I presume that the main causes of such development are dramatic increase in technologies, its’ availability for wide masses and, as a result, lower engagement in social interactions of young people.
To start with, now children and adolescents spend much less time outside, playing football or any other sport with their covenants. As a result, their communication has altered its form and transferred from streets to computers: it is a fact that young people nowadays communicate using social networks more, than in the real life. Besides, the development of online entertainment industry, and namely computer games development, has a significant impact on lack of socialisation among adolescents. Moreover, computer games like shootings or fightings, as well as many videos in the Internet, promote violence towards young people’s minds. All this negative phenomena influence harmfully a modern society.
However, parents and teachers can solve this problem. The formers should not allow their children to spend too much time with their computers and other devices, as well as they should restrict time spending in social networks. Furthermore, parents have to walk more with their children, encourage them to do sport and interact with other children. The latters, teachers, should offer to pupils such interesting topics that would encourage them to study rather than play computer games. Moreover, group projects can increase students engagement in studying and interacting with each other too.

It’s a great stereotype of the present and we have to solve it, because people of different sex should have equal rights. We can begin to solve the problem of equality at schools and universities. Let’s stop on the last.

Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. As it was said, it can solve the problem of unequalty between men and women. And now it can be said this problem is almost solved. the movement of feminism in the middle of the 20th centure did a great deal.

On the other hand if universities will accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject we will get different specious market of workers. Why is it good? Nowadays, for example, at schools there are more teachers that are women and it’s dull as possibly, men are more talented in some things. It’s productive to get equal promotion of specialists between men and women.

As far I'am concerned, the governments should provide more opportunities for people to do sports as it is of the best solution in order to deal with the problem of decreasing public health.


In the first place, various kinds of sport centers for people of every age likely to improve the access of population to sport classes. As a matter of fact, if there are lots of different centers near the residential areas, people will receive an opportunity to visit them frequently and will take sports courses, which they like. As a result, such solution will help to increase people's interest in sports activities and improve public health.


Another point in favour of increasing the quantity of sports facilities would be the fact, that people will have an access to sports activities, which do not recieve any payments. In fact, there are many situations in which person do not have enough money to pay for courses in special centers. However, if there are special areas with cheap equipment, it will increase the number of people who do sports and will certainly have positive effect on their condition such sports activities will help them to keep fit and healthy.


However, some people argue that it is more useful to rise the sums of money, which are given to the hospitals or scientific researches as it will help to find new ways in order to fight with different deseases and to decrease the number of people's illnesses.


Taking everything into consideration, government should provides not only new sports facilities, but also takes other measures, such as to increase the sums of money for scientific researches and medical equipment.

From my point of view, copies should be banned. Firstly, when you buy a disk with films or song, you show the respect to the author. Secondly, it motivates a singer of a film director to make more films or organize more concerts to show new pieces of art and culture.Thirdly, you give them a chance to improve their skills of renew musical instruments.

Between 1980 and 2030 took place a significant jump in population. From 2030 to 2040 the proportion dramatically climbed to the peak of 27%.

To my mind, the Internet is a huge unreal location for crime. Downlowding music, films and other types of media is illegal nowadays. What is more, we should not forget that special part of our society lose huge amounts of money because of pirate copies. These people do a really hard work producing films or music. This business is their work and they get money for it. Why does it allow to get their work and money bock? I consider, we have to punish people who download some files for free and using illegal methods. We should appreciate hard work of media-sphere.
Some people wouldn’t like to support my position because they use illegal methods by themselves. These people think that Internet is a free zone for everybody. They don’t understand why they cannot use some sites with music or films. It is normal situation and we just have to explain them about some author’s rights and pirate copies. We should not forget about punishments. If you copy or share music or films on the Internet, you have to pay fee or sometimes it can be more strict punishment.
To sum up, I would like to say that Internet is a free zone but with boerders. If you don’t know these boarders and allow yourself to do what you want, you should be punished.

An infinite varity of people prefer watching sport when they have time on their hands. And I can see this point of view. However, some people argue that this is a useless activity. In this essay I am going to discuss both sides, express my opinion and provide some examples.
I can surely say that sport is one of the best and important things in our life. Fisrtly, we can watch sports on TV and in real live as a kind of our hobby. It should be said that hobby is essential because it can broaden our mind and help to escape from reality. Secondly, watching sports can rally people because of the same feelings and emotions. Thirdly, it is very wonderful to have an opportunity to watch sport with your friends and just relax. As for me I am really happy when my family and I visit sport events or sit together on weekends, watch sports on TV and comment the game like we are great commentators like Vasiliy Utkin.
However, some people think differently. They claim that watching sports is just a waste of time. It should be noticed that loving sport can be possible only after watching it at least once. I have friends that do not like sport events. But when it comes to the qusetion ""Why"", they can not answer. And the reason is that they have never tried to take up this kind of hobby. Watching sports have something common with reading books. You should only set the wheels in motion and start, and then you will be not able to stop doing it. In conclusion, I would like to underline that every person has his or her own interests and opinion. And it is normal when one of two friends like sport, while the other friens can not stand it. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that watching sport as well as doing sport always was and is a great activity.",60,2,1

Firstly, these athelets who were caught using doping are not only banned from competing proffesionally but also shamed by society a lot. So they are practically penylized twice. To my mind, it's enough to prevent further attempts. Secondly. sometimes sportsmen don't even know that they are using forbidden sypplies.

Unfortunately,not everyone can protect their child from entering the world of crime.
Further in my essay I would like to speak about various possible reasons for this upward trend and who and how can deal with this problem.

Firstly, there is a huge amount of adverse servers and advertisement nowadays.Therefore, any child wants to be the 'the coolest' person in the class, he or she desired of having great power and everybody dreams of beying looked up to. Usually, all this can be reached only by fierce actions. For instance, the boy who is fourteen meets the young rap band and he wants to be one of them, but those boys could only just laugh at him and force to do unpleasant things.
Moreover, another important cause of engaging in crime could be the lack of money. There is such an enormous number of products that a toung person could have wanted. Every expensive thing is observed and studied by a youngman from every side, and it is vituallu necessaru for him or she to get it. This situation can lead to completely awful consequences, for example, shoplifting, shooting or even murder.
Talking about the solutions, the first thing that has come to my mind is the parent-child relashionships and parents control, you should spend as much time with your child in his or her childhood as you can, at least simply giving advice what is wrong and what is right. In addition, I believe that special cources at school would greatly help pupils. In my view, every teacher should think about it and maybe prepare a short speech on different topics in crime and the health of every student.

Overall, there are numerous reasons for crime development between young persons, however, there are not less ways to combat I would strongly recommend every adult person to be aware of your children's hobbies or friend, try to protect them with the help of teachers or doctors - do everything what is needed for your child to be safe.",70,2,1

From my point of view, such kind of quotation leads to the descrimination of some students. A girl might have high results and recommendations but she will not be accepted because of your genderas there are, for example, already 30 girls and no boys have applied yet.
Any restrictions of that kind provoke problems in specialization of female and male students. It is absolutely clear that boys and girls nowadays still differ and tend to have different career orientations. That is why it is unfair to make them choose certain subject because of gender limitations in another one they would have preferred to study instead.
Technical field is known to be more demanded among boys when girls would more likely go for fashion industry or sociology. There is going to be a disbalans in the number of female and male students in each subject because of this psychological factor. 
There is a believe that equal numbers of students of each gender should be accepted by universities in every field.
From my point of view, such means of quotation might lead to the discrimination of a great number of students, both males and females.
For example, a girl may have scored high test results and still will not be accepted due to her gender as there have already been shaped a group of ten girls and only boys are legit since this time. Any restrictions of that kind tend to cause problems in the special ration of male and female students. Boys and girls nowadays as a matter of fact, are still expected to have different career expectations and opportunities as well as different fields of interest. It is unfair to make students of both gender base their orientation on universities’ quotations and choose certain subjects over another one they would have preffered to study instead due to gender limitation.
One field is known to be more demanded among boys when another is popular with girls. That is a psychological and sociological factor which can not be neglected by universities’ authorities. There is going to be a disbalans in number of female and male students in each subject and it is normal, that is why no changes should be applied in that case.

However, other people claim that government should control and restrict the creative artist’s work. In this essay the arguments supporting the this issue will be discussed.
On the one hand, we are living in the faced-paced development, where values of living are constantly changing. Thus, new works of art in museums and all kind of films are changing too. As can been seen clearly, this modern not ones becomes less popular than it was in the past but also heavy to understand esspessialy foe youth generation. There are contain a lot of violence, which have a bad influence on children’s views.
There are a lot of examples when children want to be entertained and therefore, when they watch a modern film with a lot of violence on it, have a bad influence on theire behavior and  views. Taking everything into consideration the best course of action would be to control all ideas of creative artists for decrease a bad influence for children and young generation.
On the other hand, if government will restrict all of artist’s work the artists can’t work productively, because they will be under a big pressure. As a result, the number of really talented works will be less, then in the past. It is very bad for all modern art and films.
In conclusion, according all arguments it should be said, there is no absolute answer to the question of government restriction on creative artist’s work, but from my point of view, government should control the ideas of artist, because sometimes that works have a bad influence for children’s and young generation’s views.

It has become common place that people prefer air travelling for business and other aims. This way of travelling put under threat the wellbeing of the Earth, some people believe that this feature should force governments to establish laws that will decrease the time spent on travelling by planes. This point of view seems rather pointless for some reasons. To start with, it is undoubtful that planes’ fumes contaminate air and cause global warming, but what can be said about the most widespread means of transport about the car? As cars are udes much more often, they pollute air even more, but it is not reasonable to restrict all means of transport just not to pollute the planet. People should invent new ways of transportation or improve existing ones so they would become more eco-friendly. Moreover, as more id the countries are democratic governments, laws that reduces amount of time spent traveling by planes for business and leisure whenever a person wants may be regarded as a restriction of freedom which is against the constitution. The last but not the least, there is something to be said for air travelling, it is one of the safest and the most comfortable means of transport. In addition, it is the quickest way of transportation. The pluses of using plains outweight their drawbacks. To conclude, it is evident that planes pollute air and cause global warming, but establishing laws to decline the amount of air travel is not a way of solving this problem, because people are eligible to choose means of transport that is most appropriate for their needs. The only thing that government should do is to force the improvement of planes so that they will produce less harmful fumes.

The first bar chart shows that the number of people using desktop Facebook version in 2013 is slightly smaller than in 2012: approximately 137 millions of users versus 150 millions. In the same time, the amount of users who works with mobile version has significantly grown: from almost 60 millions of users in 2012 to approximately 98 in 2013.

The second bar chart shows what are the main reasons for using Facebook for men and women. The percentage of women who use Facebook for sharing photos and videos is much higher than the percentage of men who use this social network for the same reason: 54% versus 39%. Moreover, female users are more likely to use Facebook to looking for funny posts (43% versus 35%) and learning about ways to help others (35% versus 25%). The percentage of users who mostly use Facebook for receiving updates is the same for both men and women: 39%.

Some people say that governments should control our transport system and reduce the amount of or travel. First, the airtransport is one of the most safe and the fastest ways to take people from point A to point B. secondly, when people accident with planes happens there are not o lot of bad influence for environment. For instance, when ship sinks many animals die because of gasoline or oil coming out from the trunks. However, there are some people who are in ship dissagreement with this opinion. Critics are quide to point out that planes are safe for persons who want to travel but dangerouse for other part of mankind because of high level of pollution which was caused by air travelers and that’s why we should stop using airtransport. But other part of critics are absolutely sure that this opinion is far from reality because the progress in airways will influence on researchers and they will invent new types of engine which will use less gasoline. To conclude, it isn’t difficult to give full justice to the problem of pollution caused by air travel. I think that in the future planes will use less gasoline or petrol and governments should not introduce lows to control the amount of air travel.

Modern society demands effective ways of handling with this problem, for instance, the increase of the length of inprisonment. But whether it is a reasonable and beneficial desision is a controversial issue worth discussing.

Many people claim that if criminals stay in prison for a longer period of time, it would result in the more peaceful life in the city. To begin with, it is quite unlikely that the short punishment might change the person. It is essential to make him/her reflect long enough about the crime they commited and give them time to get psyhological treatment if needed. In addition, the longer criminals are isolated the safer is the city environment, these people do not respect the rules of our society and they do not deserve to be the part of it. Moreover, in prisons people are offeed different work-programms, they may even master a new job and later, after a long term become more efficient members of our society.

However, some people do not share this point of view and state that the increased length of inprisonment is not a way out. Firstly, government spends too much money on criminals, when they live in jail. These resourses could be used on a better purpose. Secondly, the people are different and staying for a long period in a cruel and pressing prison environment might be fatal for week personalities. People will not realise their mistace, on the contrary - they can become more violent. Thirdly, with the development of modern psychology, it is possible to create an individual programms for each prisoner, find his/her own way to a new better life.

In conlusion, in a modern society the long isolation of criminals cannot be an effective desision. Personally, I think it is more imporant to find a way to prevent people from becoming criminals. Hopefully, it the future the political and economic situations in the country will be improved and people will be satisfied with their lives, because it this case crimes are not nessecary.",70,2,1

And the sum pirates can bit off from stealing someone’s music cannot damage producor’s or author’s budget in that gros harmful way massmedia shows us.
Actually, common citizens do not even know about piracy and how it affects on artsmen. They only want to get free content from Internet. In this case a problem is inside human’s mentality. Unfortunately, not all of us are ready to show full respect to a property of another person. So, to solve this case, a clarification is needed, as much as a new strict law that can provide safety for authors. People must be told, how hard author’s work is. Speaking about safety of data, we must remember it should be banished with an administration issues of the law. Maybe, the penalty money can serve a better idea – to find new projects from grate masters of Art. This must be counted as an option for users to support authors. As turned out, the public does not want to pay for musician’s or writer’s work, but also feels enraged when goverment tries to protect author’s property.

We live in this world and poor conditions of it may contribute serious problems for people. For example, bad environment may lead different health problems. As a result a lot of people can become ill. It must be said that there are some health problems that are very difficult to cure. What is more important, a great amount of cases when air kinds of transport suddenly broke durind the flight are known. It means that not only things but even men suffer from such business and leasure travelling.
An opposite opinion exists. There is a belief that air travels pollute the environment less than different plants. So, governments should introduce laws to reduce the number of such factories. In addition, travels by plane are the fastest and the most comfortable travels. It is a known fact that modern people are always in a hurry. Sometimes they have not got enough time to walk with their children or even to sleep. So, travelling by air kinds of transport saves people's time.

But what is the perfect time to start learning it? Experts argue whether we should begin at primary or secondary school, although leaning towards the earliest variant.
  To begin with, it is a well known fact that young children have a better capacity for learning. Their memory is faster, their imagination is more picturesque and the world is their oyster. So, primary school may be the perfect time to learn as much as possible. 
  Still others may advocate that kids should be allowed to have a normal childhood. Who are we to make them spend all precious days with books, studing hard? It is also not profitable for their health, for instance, an eyesight.
  However, I consider heath reasons to be irrelevant to this matter. For example, I used to study English in the kindergarden. But it involved mainly playing with toys and naming them, memorising cards and watching primitive cartoons. I believe there can be no harm in that. Education for kids is a lot different and should be as entertaining as possible. This way a child will take more interest in learing and will gain both more pleasure and profit. Moreover, there are a lot of difficult subjects starting in the secondary school. It is easy for a pupil to become overwhelmed with new information. 
  To sum up, it is never too early or too late to learn. Children are open-minded and clever, so even a primary school is a good time to begin learning a foreign language if it is done in a right way.

I strongly agree that countries and states from all over the world have to provide and organize in order to decline air-flights. To begin with, today we can see that the majority of departures and air-flights are consisted of only half of all passengers, who want to go to travel. So government should explain companies related to transportation in the air, that they have to decline everyday flights. Secondly, reducing the number of travelling by air-transport can help to short crushes that happens so often today.
However, people believe that it is very important to save the number of air-flights and government and states do not need to have a deal with air companies. Firstly, it is so comfortable for people to take a flight, whenever they need it. For example, if a person is a businessman, he can be in need to be in 3 hours in the other place of the world. That’s why he must have an opportunity get a flight currently. Secondly, many people state that there is no damage from air-transport for our nature. Probably, this happens because of the lack of statistics and information about today’s situation with environment.
To sum up, today it is a very important to care about environment, because we have to think about myself, but about the next generations. And all states have to make measures that

However, there is another situation in European Union, where an unemployment rate increases on 0,4% in 2015, while in 2014 it was 7,5%.

Now (and in our history also) it is a very big problem to governemt and cityzens. It's better to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of total freedom for the creative artist for instance. Can they make work with sens of freedom? What can restrict their?
First of all discuss the opinion about restriction. In democracy we can't restrict anybody if they don't make a crime. In other political regims we can see that some artists can't work and move in other country or government make force to create according with some rools. The rools should maintain order but don't restrict people. In this case restriction have a positive hand. But government can restrict our body and our action in democracy. It is called biopolitics when government care about halfy and private life. In this way we could not notice that we are controlled. For instance government controll sexuality, smoking or alcoghol and refused to editors of film or books to use this topics.
However how to explaine to somebody about sexuality or  desease, for example, if we can use this themes? The new word in arts it totally revolution. Picasso for instanse or other postmodern afrtist attract us because their art do not restricted. They don't limit themself and many people love this art. Somebody could dislike or hate modern art but they havn't a rool to restrict other people, they can't limit right of others to admire another culture, another style.

Art has always been an important part of our life. It means that we need all the artists and other creative people who feed our minds and souls, who help us to develop, who give us a fuel for thoughts. So it artists won't have a freedom to express their ideas, we (ordinary people) won't have all the benefits of art. If their would be governmental control under art, we would get in our minds what government wants. It means that we won't be free. Such a situation was in the USSR, for example.


More than that, artists are also human beings. And it's normal, that they cannon bring out their potential in 100% way, if they work under tension, or in the censorship. With no doubts, we can say, that interventions in art by government will affect creativity in a negative way.


Also, many artists and other creative people sometimes criticize things, which happen around them, political regime for example. To my mind it's a goes wrong in a country. It helps evaluate problems of different periods.

According to statistics, nowadays the young are more involved in crimes than ever before. This may happen due to various reasons. To begin with, there are a lot orphans and children living in a street these days. Women and men who are not ready to become parents leave their kids who from this moment have to live on their own. Not knowing what to do and where to go, they join children like them and thay have to steal food and clothes to survive and it becomes normal for them to live such life, life of criminals. What is more, there are families where parents work to much and do not pay enough attention to their children, who eventually make friends with groups of hooligans and marginals. They do not have a good example of the righ behaviour, and that is why they become criminals.

Nevertheless, there are ways to prevent this from happening and solve the problem. First of all, parents should spend more time with their children, they should raise them properly, explaining to kids what is right and what is wrong from the very young age. In addition, parents should control their children's activities and be aware of who their friens are and what they do in their free time. Moreover, not only parents, but also teachers should take part in forming the person, so he or she will not commit crime in the future. Teachers could give lessons devoted to crime and punishment, explaining the consequences of commiting a crime. Finally, they could organise additional classes, which could discover and develope teenages' talents and which would occupy them, so they will not have time for bad activities.
In conclusion, the level of crime commited by youngsters has increased in recent years. There are numerous reasons for this situation, mostly because of lack of parent's control. But it can be solved with the help of parents and teachers, who should provide a good examle to children and show them the right way to life.",70,2,1

This is especially true when we are talking about the use of illegal drugs. However, the punishment for those who were caught on such an unfair business elicits controvesy: while some people claim that these sportsmen must be excluded from competitions for the rest of their lives, others say that it can only be done for a limited period of time. In the following essay both of these viewpoints are going to be discussed.
In my viewpoint, those who think that we should bann athlets using drugs for the unlimited period have several reasons for it. First of all, nowadays cheating during the competition have became such a wide-spread appearance that only strict measures can prevent it from further expansion. Another reason is the fact that winning with the help of drugs is against the simpliest aspects of our moral code that says that it is highly unfair to act this way, expecially in respond to those who are loosing while following the rules.
Nevertheless, there are people who disagree with the above - mentioned opinion. Their main argument is that athletes are often forced to use drugs by their coaches and other people who also gain success if they win. Due to this, sportsmen should not be eliminated for the rest of their lives, instead, it is better to punish those who are also involved in crime. Moreover, people clame that even if an athlete is actually the one to blame, he can improve his attitude and overlook his values.
Even though it might be true to say that the evil can be battled in every human, hence, we should give the blamed athletes a chance to prove that they can win without cheating, I believe that the first approach towards the problem of drugs in sports would be more correct in the present situation. Even though softer measures can be taken in the future, right now the issue of the discussion is out of control, so only the highest measures taken by government and society can prevent it from becoming even more crucial.

Moreover, watching sport can help to person relax and forget about the daily problems. In addition, if a person is a sportsman and he/she follows different sport events, he/she can easily learn from others sportsmen how to use some special technicues in his or her personal experience. As a result, the person will be likely to win in different competitions or can improve yourself in oder to be stronger and healthier.

Furthermore, at these matches person can find his/her soulmate and become friends. For instance, future friends can share their personal advice, can help each other and simply go to match in oder to relax or vote for the favourite team. At the same time, people should be rather careful at sport matches, because there are a lot of opponents who can easily make the conflict or gang up to fight.

It is visibly that the highest demand for electricity appears: during the coldest months of the year. So, relative to the consumption of electricity in summer, the winter consumption is double-higher. Furthermore, in winter the curve gradually increases to reach 40000 units of electricity by 3 o’clock in the morning. This is followed by gradual decline to the lowest point of 30000 units at 9 o’clock.
Speaking about summer time, the consumption of electricity gradually decrease to reach its lowest point around 9 o’clock of a bit more than 10000 units. A gentle increase is noticed to reach its peak of 20000. After this, it stays constant (15000 units) between 3 o’clock and 10 o’clock at night.

The same 15% of electricity is used for both lighting, TV radio and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electronic tools.

Percent of unemployment decreased in the Middle East from 11% to 9,6% and in Latin America from 6,8% to 5,8%. The highest rate is in Africa – 12,5. It is not surprisible, because last 3 years this region is rather unstable. The lowest rate is in South Asia, the percent is 3,9. Experts explain it as an “asian economic miracle”, that is why there is small percent of people, who can not find a job. A negative trend can be noticed in EU, the level of unemployment rised on 0,4%, from 7,5% to 7,9%. the reason for such movement is migration crises in Europe.

However there is a problem in European Union, the level of unemployment increased and nowadays experts predict that situation is going to become worse.

This opinion have several benefit. Firstly, creative artists do this world more colourful and others nice to see their creative products. For instance, the OBEY companies speciality on the street-art and we can see their picture in London and other city. Secondly, this people think new way in the art. And in each country have different artists who do new things which develop imagination of public. For example, in Norway live one man who did unusually animals from plastic. Furthermore this animals can walk on the beach thanks for windy.


However this opinion have a drawbacks. And one of this disadvantages is wrong places which artists choose for their pictures. Some artists do their work on the wall of block of flats. A case of point is graffity. This art the goverment restricts. And next drawbacks is bad works of artists. Some creative people are mad and things which they do don't like the public because it may very crazy. For instance, the architector do his portret with his blood. It will not like othes. 


To conclude, the advantages outweight the disadvantages. Our world need in New art and people want see something new to do their life more different and leas boring.

Let’s find out it!
First of all, some people think that it is wrong to copy because individuals who fond of music or making films spent a lot of money on this thing. Such kind of people spents its free time to produce music or make a film. People just want to receive their fee. What is more interesting, when a person likes copying and sharing music or another object of art, he teaches his children to do it in the same way. Such children are convinced that it is normal.
Never the less, other people have claimed that it is profitable and convinient to share and copy music or films. They think that it is very expansive for common people buying the original discs. Besides, very often artists, animators and musicians have charged high prices for their works. Usually, common people cannot allow to themselves to have such expansive original films or musical discs. That is why they just copy it. Such people do not think that it is a crime or that they should be punished.
To sum up, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies it is not the best way of enjoying good music or films. In my opinion, copying and sharing art materials should be punished.

That is way there is an opinion that being of new sport facilities is the best way to improve public health. Nevertheless I think that everything is not so clear about that. 
There is no doubt, that sport is the best way to keep fit. More than that some people improve their health after serious injouries by doing  sport and it helps quiete good. There is a common practice for disabled people to start doing swimming, which helpes them to coordinate their movements in a better way.
On there other hand there are sports that are dangerous for peoples health. Sometimes this danger is not such permament thing like broken bone or twisted leg, but ones that appear in older ages like problems with heart or ackhe in your knees. There lots of proffesional sport veterans suffering from health problems connected or specified with their sport discipline. 
Also there are more obvious ways of improving public health. Ways that are generally connected with health like medicine and health industry. Building new medicine centres and promoting health care programms could be more efficient ways of rising peoples health level. Sometimes people, who have health problems, forget about caring for themselves even if they are doing sport regulary. Alexander Pluschenko, for example, had injured himself during last Olympic games, despite the fact that he knew about his health problem. 
In my opinion sport is a good thing to keep your health at a good level, but if we are looking for the best way of improving public health, we should look at another things. I consider promotion of health caring programms to be a good place to start.

Others think that such sportsmen should be banned from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives. Arguments on both sides of this issue need to be examined carefully. I firmly belive that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned for the rest of their lives. I think that this view is correct and will disuss the reasons why in this essay. Arguments surrounding the issue of illegal drugs in sports will be discussed too.
The first point to consider is that sportsmen should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period (eg. 2 years). I don't believe that this measure can solve the problem of illegal drugs in sports. Although athlets who use illegal drugs would be banned for limited period, they could continue their professional career. After banned years such athlets could take part in competitions and use illegal drugs again. Others sportsmen who did not use illegal drugs before could use drugs as their negative examples.
The idea that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives, in my point of view, is brilliant. First of all, this measure can prevent the use of illegal drugs in sport, because all athlets want take part in competitions. It is interesting to note that, according to many psychologists, this idea is workable solution. Evidence for this is found in many scientific articles. Secondly, athlets who did not use illegal drugs before would not use drugs in sport as their collegues.
To conclude, nowadays many people are concerned about the problem of the use of illegal drugs in sport. Some people believe that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period, others think that - for the rest of their lives. I firmly belive that such sportsman should be excluded from competing professionaly for the rest of their lives because this measure can prevent the use of illegal drugs in sport: young athlets would not have bad examples and the sportsmen who used illegal drugs could not take part in the professional competitions at all.

Comparing both countries, it can be noticed that they have different tendencies in changing. 15-59 years people in Yemen are increasing, while in Italy this number decreases. In Yemen 60+-aged population is almost the same, however in Italy it rises.  Nevertheless, in Italy 0-14 years people are constant, but in Yemen in 50-years period it`s becoming bigger.

But I definitely disagree with such position and I’ll explain why.
Firstly, free information sharing is a very important factor in a cultural development as for every particular person, as for society as an infity. By watching for listening to products discussed we obtain huge material for analyzing and reflecting. We may become emotionally fulfill and we may get a very profound knowledge of who are we and where are we going. Can it be possible to imagine our world without Beatles? Weren’t they some kind of a voice of generation common symbol? Yes, they were. And was imagine what would happen, if access to their art were hardly restricted, if so-called pirates were punished for such dynamic “illegal” sharing? Would you support such restrictions?
Secondly, as for as I’m concerned, every artist wants his work to be seen and valued. It is not about money, but about self-expression, self-manifestation if you want to call it 10. And Internet, free sharing, pirates – all mentioned allows creators directly communicate with their potential (and non-potential) authority, with those who could understand them. Capitalist login of investments and incomes do not work in such case musical label, midue-concernt do act in a role of giant parazyte.
To conclude; I’ll say that free share is a mechanism which helps not only public, but to an author as well. It their needs and ambitions, perfectly and encourages development dynamic of both of them. So if we must choose between general good and pragmatic material interests of firms and companies, I will undoubtly choose the first option.

Some humans believe that sportsmen using such drugs must be abandoned from professional competitions for some restricted period of time. However, other people offer to ban athletes forever.
Turning to the first point of view, it must be said that everyone can make a mistake, so it is rather fair to limit period without contests not for a long time. First of all, there are some cases when caught sportsmen even do not know about illegal drugs in their products: food and drink. It may be the opponent who cheated athlete and then told jury about it. If it is a well-organised crime, nobody will catch the criminal and instead of him this sportsman will be blamed. Such precedents are mostly widespread in big competitions such as Olympic games. Secondly, athlete may use illegal drugs if he is not ready to contests. Hence, it is important to remove him from competition and give him certain time, a year or some years, to keep himself in fit and compete with other candidates, without dopping.
However, some sport fans and organisators take care of the culture of sport with incredible love and tenderness. Consequently, for such people the usage of illegal drugs is the worst crime which deserves the strongest measures, because sportsmen who commit the crime, understand what they do: all depends on fortune. Nonetheless, athletes who do not respect sport and its principles cannot be called as sportsmen. 
To sum up, I want to say that despite the existence of these two radical opinions, I firmly adhere to the first one. I understand people who use illegal drugs, though I do not appreciate it: undoubtedly, sportsmen have a panic before the contests, they have to represent the whole country and all these factors lead to dopping in the final stage. Nevertheless, it is not the worthy reason to betray sport rules.

Seconldy, the widespread use of modern technology led to raising amount of children who started sick with epilepsy.

That is why problems with eyes can be reduced by surgery, and every year more and more people do that. The problem of children epilepsy can not be solved at all, but it can be reduced by parents' control. The third problem can be prevented only by parents and friends who know that real life is more beautiful in various things and who can help with nice words to understand teenagers that it is.

Firstly, what kind of problems that can be? Of course, the first one is that people in modern societies have the high risk of have a big weight. They can be fat, because they didn’t have time to doing sports and to improve their health by morning exercise, for example, or by running. They think that the better way to spend time in the morning is watching TW or spent time in sociasl medias. 
Second problem is that some people so attracted by their work, that when they have been ill, they didn’t want to have a normal help by doctors and didn’t go to the hospital. They think, that some medicaments, which are product of modern technology, can help to feeling themselves better. But it is not true think always.
There is no doubt, that the both problems can be reduced, first of all, goverment and media should help to every person to knowing about simple rules of health care. For instance, peoples should know, that they should think about their weight and sometimes do some exercise. Maybe, once they can go to the work not by a transport, but by a cycles.

One part of people prefer talk about electronic information in terms of “intelligent property”. They say that there is no difference between the ways of distributing films or music. Even somebody want have them only in digital form, without using CD-disks, he or she still have to pay for the products. It has some reasons because workers spent their time and laber to made or developt the films, music or soft, and they need to get money for their job. “Why the master piece of music is less important for customers that master piece of art?” Other problem is sharing with friends when one of them give another a book, another makes exchange with his friend… Is it “pirate network”? As usual, the producers say “no”. Their powers are enforced against people who make money by copying of their production.
To the opposite, second part prefers talk about free exchange and free flaws of information. Their philosophy is close to anarchist theory that means the rise of human knowledge and solidarity in the situation. “If someone really likes the product, he or she will go to cinema, or donate money for the author. The biggest part of price is outcome of labels greed”, - they say. And sometimes it happens: people buy a game to support the game studia and go to the concerts because they like illegally downloaded album. And these people share the information because they enjoy it and try to help strangers to feel it too.
Generally, both sides have arguments. For me conception of free-sharing is more modern and essential for digital society. It also may stimulate producers to do their job better. I mean, if their film is interesting and important, I will go to the cinema. If an album is unusual, I will buy tickets to premiere of it. May be, if people just do their job perfectly, the problem will be resolved. The success of European pirat party supports this opinion.
