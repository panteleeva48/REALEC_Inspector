From my point of view, this question is really complicated to be sure on 100%. I'm absolutely agree with that fact the characteristics we are born with with control our destiny in majority situations. For example, a man with perfect body, good physical shape and ideal health can think about being a sportman, an astronaut or what ever he want. If a girl has a powerful math skill and an amazing memory she can try herself in science sphere. My idea is that our genetic characteristics, as a rule, could help us to understand in which sphere we can do our best. It's hard to believe that a person 1,35 meters tall will be good at basketball or a student with a bad memory will become a math professor.
On another hand it isa bry mistake to think that people cannot change themselves into others. Everything is depending on your will. There are many examples of people who had some weakness but overcame them. We can confirm that even in society of ideal people it is possible to reach your dream. There is no borders, if you really try.
Unfortunately, researches are working with statistics and in majority situations don't have enough will for change themselves. That's why we can say that genetic influence on us is more powerful. 
In conclusion, I'd like to emphasize that these two ideas have enough arguments to be exist. So, everybody should decide by themselves which is more suitable for them. Use your genetic characteristics and improve them or try to overcome your weaknesses because of your dreams.

As for Yemen, there is some significant changes over 50 years period. Particularly, percentage of generation aged from 15 to 59 is predicted to grow by just above 10 percent, whereas it is expected that the share of children not older 14 years dramatically reduce from about 50 percent to 37.

Some people think that these networks should be to share information and knowledge. Others believe that the main purpose should be simply to entertain. In this essay both opinions will be discussed. Let us begin with the first opinion, which stoles that such social medias as Facebook and Vkontakte should be just a source of information. It has reasons to be stated. Firstly, nowadays many people especially young ones believe the Internet sources of information more than TV, newspapers and other traditional media, because in the Internet they can find thousand of videos, photos and other materials about events, science and so on. Also, it is much quicker and cheaper to use Facebook and Vkontakte for looking for information about anything,. It usually takes several minutes while TV or Press journalists and experts need hours and even days to making reports. On the other hand, social networks were developed as a mean of communication, they became social medias later. It takes them a source of not only an information about different aspects of human life, but also a very good instrument of manipulation. For example, people can comment some news or articles in a very free way, which makes the threat of conflicts among thousands of users very high. Moreover, some bloggers and other popular people from the Internet sometimes use their popularity in political or social conflicts, and it makes them more sharp and dangerous for human society. To sum up, social media and networks were created for entertaining, to give people a chance to communicate, even if they are in different cities or countries. But because of their conversation these networks such as Facebook had to become a source of knowledge and information, which people discuss, and it is normal process. And in my opinion social media should be to share information, but people, who use it, should remember, that every information and every their world must be checked and weighed up.

In these days Internet and spending time on the different websites have become an essential part in our life. There are two different points of illegal downloading films or music and importance of punishment for them. In this essay will be explain some reasons of agreement or disagreement with this problem and will be given some examples for better evidence.
Firstly, it can be noted that musicians and film producers have author’s patent on their product because it was their innovation. In consequences they lose a lot of money from illegal pirate copies. It is wrong because people must have a salary from their job. A good case of it is a typical situation on the factory when every worker want to have a salary because he or she every day go to the factory and do their work. In this point of view it can be understood why people who do illegal pirate copies should be punished.
On the other hand, there are some reasons why people disagree with punishing for people which do illegal pirate copies. It can be proved by financial opportunities of majority population in the “lion” part of countries in the whole world. For instance, citizen from the East European’s country has a salary only 150 or 200 dollars per months. The same time, people want to spending their free time more interesting and try to relax with music or film. Unfortunately, original disk with music or film have cost about 15-20 dollars per disk. In this situation people don’t have any opportunities for buying original disk. In result, it can be seen that we have demand on music/film from poor people and we have supply on free download all what you want in the Internet.
Taking everything mentioned up into account I want point that problem with illegal pirate copies need to have other solution, because punishment only will provoke to find new ways of free download favourite film or music. Also, in my view, I absolute disagree with punishing for people who don’t have any opportunities for buying original disk. Government need to find a new decision, for example, some charity payments or subsidiary.

There is an opinion about the increasing number of devices can be harmful for our health. It is important to agree with position written above. In fact, it is impossible to imagine modern life without technologies. They affect our lives enormously. Unfortunatly this influence is not always safe for our health, but there are different ways to come with these circumstances. One of the main provlems according to this conctraereral issue is eyes spoiling. It accures when someone uses such devices as mobile phone, computer, laptop or smartphone every day. Naturally, human eyes can  not deal with long and bright light affection, although such workers as, for example, programmers and designers spent all days in front of computer monitors. Due to this, they all (in most cases) used to wear glasses. Another problem is connected with physical appearance. Modern people (not all of them of course) have not enough time even to go for a wail and to do some sports. 

However, there is an another point of view. In contrast some people think, that technologies help us to be healthy. It is rather unbelievable, but it is also can be the truth. There are many technologies, which reduce difficulties with the health. For example fitness centers and medicine centers have an opportunity to make you a healthy person with the help of special equipment and well-prepared doctors. Overall, it is important to mention, that everything depends on a person, who is involved in using technologies. It is obvious, that they can be reduced by the right explutation of each device and by the good time management, which allows everyone to have good lives.

Recent years there are polemics about how to improve public health. Some people believe that in orderer to achieve this goal  we should build new sports facilities. Other argue that this would have little effect.
Firstly, if governement will spend all budget on the sports facilities then people have no choice to do. This is not the best way to encourage people to stand up from theirs computer tables, but in my opinion it will work. Some people, who live in the country far away from city center, can not allow to go to the swimming pool, for example, because in order to get there, they have much money in their pocket. In this way increasing number of sports facilities can help such people to be fit.
On the other hand, increasing the number of sports facilities is not enought because governement can not force people to go there, they should want to go themselves. Moreover, small number of sports facilities is not only reason of low public health. Air, water pollution, bad food and stress can damage person`s health. For example, a lot of people go away from megapolices to claim countries because they can not hear this permanent noisy of thousands of cars, plans and fans. It is a large stress for everybody. It really harms people`s health.
To sum up the all above, I can say that building new sports facilities is well idea, but governement should concern not only about body health, but mental health. Also it is not enought to create possibilities for people who do not allow this but to encourage them to go to the jim.

At the same time the tendency of the European job market was becoming worse. Huge amounts of working migrants just could not be employed.

Therefor, this essay will be about reducing air travel with the help of reproducing laws. That is why it’s necessary to discuss: will laws be really effective? First of all, it can be effective if the governments set up a law reducing air travelling, because in this essay it can be seen that the amount of air travellings will decrease and it is logical th people will become involved in the travel using trains or cars that are cheaper than air trips. Thereby, this political manipulation will help not only air situation but also traffic modernization. In addition, when there are some problems that are related with air pollution it will be a good idea to use the law, because it is one of the most powerful aspect. What is more, it has a category that is related to the justice and it is a kind of abligatory and rule that controls all citizens of the country. Thereby, there is a high possibility that introducing laws will be significant and effective. Overall, taking everything into account it can be say that setting up the law that will control air travels will be really useful , because there are two main reasons: firstly, all laws are obligatory for all people or a person will be punished. Furthermore, introducing the law on air trips, we will help not only the environment, but also involve people in “road” trips that are cheaper than air one. Personally, I absolutely agree that the government’s laws will be useful and I think that all these arguments have enough evidences to be truthful and they can have a place.

Taking into account that it is no need in much air travel governments are expected to introduce laws which will decreased the number of business – trips by plane and air travel for leisure. As for me, I do not agree with this opinion. First of all, sometimes businessmen have important jobs and they must go to the other side of the Earth urgently. So they do not have time to go by other transport as plane is the fastest one. Moreover, some families are not able to go somewhere during long time, as they have little babies, old parents or they have illnesses, which not let them go for long by trains or other transport. So, air travel is the only way to have a rest for them. On the other side, people live till the environment is alive, so if nobody thinks about air pollution. In the near future we all will suffer from dangerous illnesses. So, businessmen can use other kinds of transport it will take additional 1-2 days, but the environment will be protected. Taking into consideration both viewpoints, I can say that there are many other global disasters, so air pollution caused by air travel is not as strong as, for instance, pollution caused by cars. All in all, nowadays people can not refuse from air travel as economics of the world is based on business; so air business travels are too important and government should not take measures to reduce them.

And some people believe that such problem arises because people do not enough sport because of lack of sports facilities. But there is also the another point of view, which says that increasing of the number of sports facilities would be not enough to motivate people and it would not have enough effect on public health.
On the one hand, those who want to improve public health by making people do sports are right: sport is the easiest and the most entertaining way to be fit and have good health. Moreover, the results of regular workouts motivate people not to stop, once they started. We saw many Paraolympics champions not long time ago and we could be motivated by their self-confidence, being ambitions and being best even without arms and legs.
But on the other hand, doing sport is not acceptable to everybody: there are some people, who have health problems but are not allowed to do physical excercises. Also, we have to remember that the organism of a man who does professional sport become tired much faster then organisms of people who do not.
To sum up, in my own view it is needed not only making everybody do sport, but an individual ways of improving health. Probably, some projects should be organized, which would provide different people making themselves healthier in different ways, provide individual program of improvement and self-development to each who would want to. The programs, which would include not only training but choosing a meal program and so on.

Nowadays these two problems are becoming more and more popular. Lets analyze this statement. First of all, the governments must introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. In Russia there are special organisations which fight with air pollution and global warming (for example, the Greenpeace). They make conditions for struggle with these problems (demonstrations, other active methods). Secondly, in my opinion, people from different countries try to combine efforts to cope with the presented problems. Th process of globalisation is the best way to it. Thirdly, air travel can be reduced by using other types of transport such as trains, buses, ships and soor. To my mind, the government should install the time which business and install the time which business and leisure can use air travel. The experience shows that if we don’t pay necessary attention on these problems, the catastrophe will be come on. To sum up, based on aforementioned argument it can be concluded that the better laws the better regulation. People (businessmen, at first) must save the nature with special methods.

As a result some people think that world’s government should write laws reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I personally disagree with this idea. In my opinion, air travelling is not the toughest thing for the atmosphere. For example, it is well-known that the amount of CO2 which excessive amounts of sheep and goats produce is much larger than humans do. That is dangerous. Secondly, air travelling can not be reduced because people will just loose money – pilots, cabin crews and even those who fly for business meetings. For example, my brother flies from Moscow to Dubai 3 times a week, because that is his job. He earns money to support our family and himself. If most of the flight are canceled; then he would not be able to earn money. Other people say that air travelling is very dangerous because of the air pollution it gives the planet. They suppose that by minimizing air travelling it would be possible to save the planet. I love nature and would love to make the world better, I still think that air travelling is not the most harmful thing on Earth, compared with vast amounts of waste, for example. In conclusion, it can be said that air travelling takes a huge part of human’s lifes which means that it is impossible to simply cut down the number of flights and planes. There has to be made a complex decision, which can fight against the problem of pollution.

It is my firm belief that it is problems of musicans and film producers if somebody “gets” their money, so they should pay more attention to their problem of saving it. In addition, I consider that if I could find good film in high quality with good translation and it has no differ with original that cost some money, I may download it without doubts or regrets.
Nevertheless, there are opponent of this view who claim that it is bad. They also point out that everyone should buy original versions thinking about producers’ money. But I strongly disagree with them, because people should pay money only for tickets in the cinema and music halls, especially if they see singers alive. But if I watch film at home, it could be free. I also want to repeat that if people (I mean producers and musicans) lose money, they just try bad to save it.
In addition, goverment shouldn’t punish people, who use illegal copies; if it want to solve this problem it should try to stop copying and sharing music or film and punish people who make such files.
I hope, my arguments are convincing, and somebody could support my point of view.
P.S. I also want to remark that original films and music that cost money are not always given in perfect quality. In contrast with pirates’ copies that everybody always can find with good translation and download very quickly.

There are both advantages and disadvantages in such kind of approach. There are several advantages of such way of developing a business. First of all, it is the cheap working force. The labour of local people can be paid less because in much cases the level of unemployment is very high in poor countries, so those people do not have a choise what kind of work to do. Another thing is that the costs for renting a place in poorer countries is much lower than in developed, so it is profitable for international companies to move their business in such zones. Such a situation now is in South-East Asia where much of departments if international countries are located. Surely, all these advantages make the product's cost lower than in would be in more developed countries. Of course, there are some disadvantages. One of them is that the companies often do not think about the enviromental problems of poorer countries. The factories belonging to international companies pollute the area because the governments of these countries do not control the level of polluting the enviroment. So, the Earth really suffers from it.

On the one hand, the fact of downloading illegal copies and files is unfair, firstly, towards the famous musician or film director. There are lots of pirate sites on Internet that are providing access to a diverse range of works to download for free. For example, every person now can get any song he/she want to listen for free. However, the different part of humanity still pays for every song or film to download from Appstore, for example.

On the other hand, as longer as such pirate sites exist, as longer consumers would use it and this is a huge problem that need to be solved. If there were no illegal Internet resources or illegal documents, people would not have something free to download and they will anyway use only original resources with fixed prices. So we will not have thieves. 

By way of conclusion, there are some measures that need to be taken to restrict and finally stop consumers from downloading copyright materials for free. First of all, government and police are ought to establish fees both for companies who spread illegal copies and for those people who download it. Then this measure is taken, it is better to make prices a bit lower to make original music, film etc more accessible and obtainable for consumers.

Many great discoveries were made, but are they so great that they mean more than unsolved issues on Earth? I tend to agree with the opinion that money spent on space exploration can be more useful on Earth.
First of all, poverty is still a very big issue in lots of countries. There a still places where average income is about 15 dollars a month, whereas one spaceship start (not always a fortunate one) costs billions of dollars.
There are many other problems in the world which can be solved with money. For example, some enviromental issues, such as pollution. In China this is a very big problem. There are a lot of cities with more than a million of people, this means that there are huge numbers of cars on a small territory. This led to constant smoge on the streets which led to that almost every citizen has problems with their lungs. Although, there are solutions. For example, Singapoore builds high-tech systems to grow as many plants on their territory as they can. This is a city which is also a country, there are not much space, so they decided to use rooftops, balconies, even walls as places where trees and other oxygen makers can grow.

In terms of Middle East, the unemployment rate demonstrated a modest decrease from 11% in 2014 to 9,6% in 2015. It can be clearly seen that this change was the most significant for all regions throughout the whole time frame.

Turning to the EU, we can emphisize a 0,4% increase from 7,5% in 2014 to 7,9% in 2015. In contrast, the unemployment rate in Latin America declined by 1% and accounted for 5,8% in 2015 instead of 6,8% in 2014.

One people believe that it is better to provide more sport activities. Others think that this way has not lot of influence and other things should be done.
Firstly, let us consider the advantages of increasing the number of sports facilities. In modern world more people start to care about their health by doing some kind of sport. Lots of new facilities are being developed by for example sport comitees. Moreother more fitness centers appear. Finally, there is a huge improvement of conditions for disabled people. And a good example of this are paralimpic games. 
However, there are a lot of people who do not accept this poing of view. They are convinced that all these things have no huge influence on people`s health and other methods are required. May be they think not about facilities, but about improving the conditions of their life like doing something to prevent air pollution and enviroment damage. In this case, I think, both of ways of improving health are possible, so they can exist together that is way peopl with second point of view should not be agains the first. 
In conclusion I would like to say that to my mind there is a really good situation with sport in lot of countries and if people want to do something for their health they should not blame their government and say that it is not enough methods and facilities. But may be something new can be done in order to saticfy these people.

The data are provided in Celsius per month.
At the first glance it is clear that there is no overall pattern in which temperature changes throughout the year, but there are two completely different situations in the Russian and Brazilian cities.
Firstly, it can be noticed that temperature in Rio is in general more stabilized and is never less than well above ten.The reverse situation is in cause of Yakutsk. There are obvious fluctuations during the year.
Secondly, it is evident from the graphs that temperature in Rio has only slight changes over the period of twelve months, whereas in Yakutsk average temperatures increase dramatically in summer months and then go down considerably in winter (to roughly 30 degrees below zero).
Finally, it is important to look at the highest and the lowest temperatures in both cities. In Yakutsk the temperature hit the peak in the middle of the summer (in July), while in Rio, during January and February, the average highest temperature makes up 30 degrees above zero.
Unlike in the city in Russia, where the lowest temperature is during winter months, about forty degrees below zero, the average temperature in Rio is in July (almost 17 degrees above zero).
Overall, after analyzing the information provided, it can be stated that the average maximum and minimum temperatures in two given cities are completely different.

They do this to develop countries and to let the local workers to find job. Though this tendency is rather worldwide, it has its strong and weak sides. Trying to support people in different countries with different amount of money and different level of life, international companies, however, change their own strategies, which have been working for a lot of years, and consiquently, they change the worldview of people. It is widely known that a lot of international companies nowadays turn to the stragedy of supporting the developing countries and people who cannot find job or even find their own way of life. This tendency is partly supported by the fact that people in developed countries, such as Europian countries and USA, for example, began to feel the level of difference, which appeared between their level of life and the level of life in less rich countries or in the countries, where people have very diffenrent way of life than people in developed countries have. However, globalisation makes everyone to look at their neighbourhood countries. Consiquently, the huge international companies in the developed countries understand, that they should change their stragedy of business to poorer to let people of different social levels understand their worldview and enter their trade. They employ local workers and develop counties, investing money in different social events in such developing countries. It helps not only to increase the level of life of people in the poorer countries or people, who just cannot find job, but also it helps international companies to enter different levels of trade and rise their production. However, developing their investements and entering trades of different countries, international companies change the worldview of people throughout the world. It may have its disadvantages, as such stragedy changes the cultures in different countries. It can ruin traditions in the countries, on which these companies want to have an influence, because people in such countries would better prefer richer and more stable way of life and possibilities for their future, which international companies promise to people. It is, in fact, the way of how globalisation is working. The disadvantage if this process is that people loose their individuality. It causes the changes in cultures of different countries.

Some people believe that airplanes affect greatly the ecology and cose an air pollution and global warming, while others do not share their point of view. To begin with, air travels gives people an ability to trade between countries, to transfer different technological items and to visit different regions. Moreover, there are a lot of families in which members do not live in the same countries. Air travelling helps them to support their relationships. Furthermore, while travelling, people learn about the culture of different nations, explore the environment, increase their knowledge about the world of just relax from the work and everyday problem. On the other hand, there are people who do not support their viewpoint. They consider that air travelling causes an air pollution and global warming and it is necessary to prohibit such amount of travelling as it exists now by introducing different laws. They claim that society should think more about the ecological problems of the world and stop using airplanes which damage the environment with different fossil fuels without any essential need. They believe that there are a lot of other types of transport which are eco-friendly of have the lower level of damage effect, for example, trains or ships. In my opinion, there is no need in prohibiting air travelling. Many air companies use materials for their airplanes to prevent global warming when the sun reflect of the plane during the flight. Moreover, nowadays the quality of fuel for planes increase each year because of the development of technologies in the world. This fact decrease the effect of fuels on air. And the main argument is that air travelling is the fastest and softest method of travelling or a long distance in the world. In conclusion it is necessary to mention that air travelling has different damaging effects on the environment, but the modern technologies help to prevent them and reduce the level of influencing on it every 5 years. That is why there is no need in introducing cars to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.

Some people supports the idea of narrowing down the ammount of products that are imported and manifucturing local food for citizens of this curtain country. Meanwhile, there are some major drawbacks of this belief.
On one hand, the eliminating of food that were imported may end up in the lack of variety to choose from for customers in shops and malls. But it does not mean that buyer would not be able to find a replica for some kinds of food. For example, if country wants to narrow down the quantity of sugar, solt and apples that are brought to this country in order to help local production, a customer probably will not even notice this fact.
On the other hand, there are still some products, that can not be produced in all countries such as fresh ocean fish, Asian rice, and some sorts of Japanaese meat, but can be easily imported and become irreplaceble in everyday routine. In this cases government could do two things: to begin a new production area or do import. Knowing the fact that, for country it is easier and cheaper to import than manifucturing it.
However, eventhough most products can be produced at local farm and factories, there are some types of food that had to be imported because of vast range of reasons. The most common is that for country’s consuptional rate of such products are low does not worth the money it takes to produce it. In addition, the local production may not benefit and will be broke in a few years.
To sum up, the eliminating of import and producing evething inside one country in order to feed citizens is controversial issue that needs clever solutions from government.

First of all, air pollution and global warming at all is a burning issue nowadays. There are many reasons to prevent dangerous consequences, also there are many ways to do that. However, reducing the amount of air travel is not the rest. It is definitely the awful one. Air pollution is caused not only by air traveling, but mostly by cars and its gas. For instance, such country as China is suffering by cars’ impact now and day by day. People can’t breath being at the center of the enties. 
Second, air travel is the safiest and one of the most popular transport. Statistics proves that using cars also being people more unhappiness. The amount of car crashing is great. Definitely the safity means more to society then saving planet from air pollution by decreasing flights in airports. More than that, the lack of opportunities to travel far locations can make people angry. Carm attitude is more important to governments than preventing air pollution by such kinds of ways.

Some people think, that those who copy and those music and films on the internet should be punished. But others continue copying and downloading files without thinking that it is a theft. I agree with the statement that it’s not honest and illegal, but I do not think that it should be punished.

Firstly, I want to say that I support musicians and producers and their work. And that is why I consider honest to pay for their products: of course it is a quite peasant bonus that we are allowed to listen to music or watch films for free, but in fact it is a theft of artist’s money. They invest their money, soul, emotions and energy in their product and I think that we as the audience should pay for this.

But talking about the consequences I think that punishment it is not a good way. People who download or share files should be banned, but not punished. What is more, in my opinion companies and music labels should think about better level of security of their information. Of course, there always will be people, who will find a way to take it all for freem but it will be harder to do.

One more point, that I can advice to companies is to minimize price. Maybe in that case people be more likely to buy official products. 

Downloading, copying and sharing pirate copies of music or films is not the worth criminal in the world and that is why I consider that it does not deserve a punishment.

What is allowed is always defined by political conditions, culture and society. I suppose some limitations are indispensable when we talk about the mass media, literature, movies and the Internet. 
Humans are great thinkers, leaders and affectors. The ones who are creative and are also able to pursuade the crowd to do what they want may become dangerous for the government. To avoid these problems, there should be should be some limitations for creative artists in media. Let's rememberremember some movies or books and paintings that had a great influence on us in the past. What did we feel then? What emotions could such things cause? Certainly, if a movie producer showed us the true story about our life, with all its problems, sorrows, wars and disgust, lots of poor people who were somehow represented in the movie, would have understood their misery and would also have blamed the govs in all their problems. Maybe that's true and the government is the one to blame, but such movies wouldn't probably give us any way out, any appropriate solution. The effect however may be devasting. I mean, riots, wars, murders and so on. 
Another argument against freedom for creative artists is the effect of what they show us through their work especially the effect on the youth. Young people's consciousness is not ready to process this information wisely. As a result we will get nervous, sick, stressful boys and girls. 
However these restrictions shouldn't be unreasonable. Thoughts of creative people may change the world and make it a better place to live in. As one if such famous people said a couple of weeks ago: "" We'd like to make the world move open and connected"". So why not? We must be wise and cautious, of course, but not to se enemies at every corner.

In that case, it is not a secret that it is easier to buy a film in the official store, becouse other way you lose several advantogies. With this in mind , let’s think about the quality of this content and the moral norms. As for my family, we prefer to see a film in the good resolution and we don’t want to break the rulers when we decide to watch a new movie or listen new album.
On the other hand, there are some reasones to download music of movies from the unofficial store. The main point is that we should take into accont that we live in Russia and sometimes it closes the oppotunities to find an alboum or a movie from very small foreign group or with unpopular actors. For instance, It is too difficult to find The Big Bang theory in Russian stores and also in our language. In that case, we don’t have another oppotunities and have to dounload and translate it from unofficial resources. Moreover, these Russian laws sometimes play the role of instrument for small media producers to earn money from illegal stores or, even more often, from fan cites.
To sum up, this question have different sides, but, In my opinion, there should be no illegal media at all.

There is also an opposite opinion, which says that the things have changed in digital era, so copyright legislation should be reformed nowadays.
It is likely to say, that second opinion has more convincing arguments that prove its relevance. First of all, there is a big difference between using pirate content in commercial and non-commercial aims, that should be mentioned. In first case, making money from the piece of art, which doesn’t belong to one, is literally a crime and should never be allowed, like other cases of thefts. In second case, consumer doesn’t get any commercial profit from using the pirate content, so it could not be called a criminality, because the aim of such use is not a violating of property rights, but just baring enjoyment from the piece of art.
The second argument is the case, that fighting for copyright is not productive for modern artists. Nowadays, it is very hard and expensive to delete the information from the Internet every time it appears. This amount of resources will not be covered by the profit from content every time. Modern digital technologies provide such sources of gaining profit, as crowd-funding platforms, receiving donations from the fans or just promoting one’s own concerts, exhibitions or performances, which could be monetized either.
The point of people, who defend the copyright is that the artists actually suffer from misgetting the profit from their art, and this doesn’t let then to provide appropriate life standarts. In opposite way, it could be mentioned, that the most profitable content is not independent, it is a part of record labels, producer center’s etc., which take the biggest part of gained profit to themselves, while artist takes the least slice, so modern system of copyright is bad for creators, but good for those who don’t create content, but only widespread it.
In conclusion, it could be said that the system of copyright is rather old, and doesn’t respond to requirement of digital art, it is not fair and it could be reformed in certain ways, because the modern technologies can provide different forms of making an art profitable.

The first point of view suggests that doenloading music or films freely is normal thing. Their first argument is that they don’t want to spend their money or things, which they can get without paying e.g. music, films. The second argument is that oftenly one can find in the internet things, which one can’t buy, for example, old publications or old films and music, etc. the last argument is that sometimes one need to get something right now, but can’t buy it in shops or in the Internet. Working on your course work, you might need documental films, but oftenly they are not for sale.
The second group of people disagree with it. Firstly, they argue that musicians and film-makers spend a lot of money on their products and it’s unjustice not to pay for it. For example, a lot of singers nowadays ask their fans to buy legal copies of new albums or download it from official websites for fee. Secondly, they say that it’s a exome, because there is a law about protection of author’s rights in the big range of countries. As one know, there’re a lot of precedents, when singer or film-maker won the processes against websites, where their products could be downloaded freely.
To sum up, the society is divided on two sections about this issue: the first one says that downloading things freely shouldn’t be charged bad, however, the second one argues that it is amoral and illegal and it should be punished. Unfortunately, this question is still debatable.

For instance, some alternative resourses, which could make our lifes easier in some ways. Also, here is already 7 milliards of people on our planet and we need more space to live. Space researchers try to find at least one more planet where we could survive. We know that this job is very dangerous, so workers (researches) have a big salary and equipment is also very expensive.

On the other hand, we definitely spend a lot of money on it.

In order to prove this statistics it is necessary to look at the purposes of using the electricity. By the way, the pie chart shows us that nearly 52,5% is used for heating rooms and water which is more than a half of all electricity used by English people. As for the summer it is worth noticing that the amount of units of electricity is rather small (about 20000).

To begin with, both children and adults use their computers and mobile phones more and more every day. This can have negative impacts on their eyes, because they are tense all the time. What is also harmful is that mobile phones are held too close to the eyes while using, which is even worse for them. The most obvious solution to this health problem is to get rid of its cause, in other words, to use mobile phones less. But the world is developing so rapidly that it is not really possible, since phones have become a big part of the lives. Another way to improve sight or to prevent it from getting worse is to make different exercises for the relaxation of the eyes' muscles.
The next problem is connected with the environment and the lungs. The development of modern technology includes the increasing usage of cars, factories, which influence the condition of the environment. The air, which we breathe, contains many elements that can harm our lungs, and this is what is happening now. This problem is much more difficult to solve, because it is seldom possible just to move to the place with the better environment. The solution should be more global, the owners of the factories should think of making them more environmentally friendly, the producers of the cars should do the same. This is the only way to save the ecology and to reduce negative impact on people's health.
To conclude, there are obviously many other health problems, but the mentioned ones are the most crucial. Everything should be done to solve them.

Air travel is the reason for huge ecological problems. For example, air become really dirty and water is not an exception. We should remember, that resources can end. To add to this, global warming in the increasing stage. I am sure plans destroy atmosphere by their waste.
But on the other hand, air travel have several drawbacks, which can not be admitted.

So, the largest values in unemployment regions in this period were in N.Africa and Middle East, and the least percentage numbers were in S.Asia in 2014 and in 2015 year too. And other regions’ unemployment rates were in the middle values.

For instance, tendency of acceptiry in the Universities same proportions of male and female students in each subject.
Nowadays this problem is not posed so sharpas several decades ago. Despite of this sometimes sex descrimination appears in different civilizated countries of our world. 
I can agree with the Statement given in task only if one certain point will become true: number of men and women will be equal and the history will go in another way.
It sounds great that higher education is opened for everyone, but how can universities keep sex balance in 50/50 level? It is obvious that some faculties are more attractive to male part of mankind , and some of subjects to female part. If we want to accept equal numbers of male and female students, we will be obliged to force some humans enter in the wrong way. It will not be surprise that everyone want to make their choice personally, esperiully in question of education.
In different point of view situation in sex balance between males and femals in universities will start tendency on granting really equal rights for everyone. Differences between man and woman in social ladder will become a legend, except physical development. We will see a society of women-poliyics, women-militaries and men-homekeepers. Who needs that? I do not know.
To summarize it is sufficient to say that physical differences will play their role forever. There will be fair fight between male and female minds, but mankind know so many male names, and so little number of female important persons in science and politics. We can't fight with the nature, but we can change our own rules.

There is a controversial point that governments should decrease the number of plane using for some less important actions because of huge amount of travelling by air transport as a whole. As for me, we should protect environment from different damage included air pollution and global warming. In this essay will be discussed neccessarity of protection air health compared with importance of using air travelling.
The  first idea is about alternative types of travelling. Many businessmen an rich people fond of using personal planes for moving in the air. It will be better for nature if they join to public air travelling or start use eco-friendly transport. As a result, air pollution level will decrease because of decreasing amount of travelling by plane. Some people believe that this way of moving inconvenient but they are wrong. There are special zones with a high level of comfort in planes.
The second idea is about using internet conversation instead of some real meetings. There are a lot of comfortable programmes for chatting through the internet such as Skype and Viber. According to this idea amount of using air transport also will be decreased, what can support to protect environment. Some people think that real contact with a partner better, but due to modern technologies you can have eye-to-eye contact during the talking through the internet.
In conclusion, I would like to underline that air pollution and global warming are serious problems for humanity. People should use air transport as less as they can and try to be in touch with modern eco-friendly technologies.

I totally agree with the above opinion and now I will write several reasons, why I have this point of view. 

To start with, country which can survive without import products to other government is more strong and powerful, because it has independence and economics of other countries can’t influence on the different spheres such as politics, social sphere, economics and others. In addition to this argument, humans who live on the one territory and have great food production, which can solve problems with different people demands (food demands) haven’t got enough difficulties like starvation or crysis in food industry, so they have insurance in the future days.

On the other hand, some people say, that in a lot of countries food production is play the main rile in their economics and they can’t live without importing this products, because for some reasons (especially this reasons depend on climate and location) governments can’t produce other types of products, for example, petrol. A wide range of people can survive, because their countries import and export  products. Moreover, many people believe that country which is import and also export different types of product from natural resourses till computers is growing and become more technological.
Taking everything into consideration, there are two points of view on the problem of the production and import food to other countries is very controversial, especially for governments, which have only food production. I believe, that in future years they understand that producing food only for their population give them independence and aim to import as little as possible.

In the same tie other people think that this way of travelling is the most convinient, that’s why they are not going to change the way they usually travel.
I partly agree with the second point of view and have my own thought on this topic.
First of all, I agree with these people because I suppose that plane is the fastest and one of the most comfortable way of travelling.
Secondly, I am sure that air travelling is not the main cause of warming and environmental pollution. According to my opinion different fabrics make much more harm for our nature. In this case it should be more important to think about all these fabrics, also about cars which cause global warming too. In other words, there are so many causes which are more important than air travelling about which we just don’t mention.
But on the other side there are too much airplanes owned by different businessmen now. Moreover, some of them use this kind of transport very often.
Due only to that fact, that our nature spoils by airtravelling, the amount of flyghts of rich people should be reduced. But it shouldn’t have any influence on travelling companies which just help tourists to get from place to place.
But everyone knows that with a desire everything can be done even with a banning law. That’s why I suppose that rich people will be able to find different tricks to travell anywhere by plane.
Summing up, I’d like to say that, of course, we have to take care about our nature, about everything that makes our life easier. But goverment can’t just reduce the amount of flyghts even because of themselves. As all of us know they use it more often than anyone else. And as I support the second point of view, I suppose that people should take care about all problems which a connected to our enviroment and try to find sutable solves.

Musicians and producers suffer considerable losses as a consequences of it. Some people think that it is normal to use pirate copies. Their opponents assume that these illegal actions should be punished. I claim there must be punishment for illegal copying and sharing music and video materials.

In my opinion, people should be punished for distributing pirate copies. Firstly, people who worked on a particular project lose their profit because of it. Secondly, it is dishonest that people who make illegal copies of music and films start to distribute it and turn it into a business. They gather money from people who buy this copies inspite of the fact that they have not made any contribution into the product. What is more, musicians and film producers need money to develop their activity and to get more opportunities but it is impossible as far as the profit from their products is too low because of the pirate copies which people download from the Internet.

Some people disagree with this point of view. They believe that downloading illegal copies of films and music should not be punished at all. From their point of view, people are not so rich to pay for every film they want to watch and for every song they want to listen. Besides, people assume that companies or groups which produce films or music have enough money to go on creating new ideas.

To sum up, the problem under consideration is multiple-valued. So many men, so many minds. I am inclined to think that distribution of pirate copies and downloading files from the internet instead buying should be punished. However, different points of view have the right to exist.

There are various reasons of that and problems that can be caused. First of all, our modern world becomes more and more competitive. Thus, adults have to combat their work places and to spend a lot of time on job. In this case, women are not an exception, because, as we know, humans’ needs grow and children start asking their parents to buy new gadgets, computer games in younger age that previous generations. Secondly, nowadays women become more independent, so they do not have enough time for sitting at home with their children, and, as a result, they hire a babysitter. For example, studies have shown that there were a significant growth among women as leaders of companies for the past few decades that proves that they have less time for spending it with their children. That approach can lead to some serious problems. The main problem of modern parents’ lifestyle is that children do not have enough control and it can result in their education level, social life etc. Firstly, if parents do not control their children at study, it will lead to bad marks and uncompetiveness on the job market in the future. Moreover, children who have a lack of communication with their parents may not have enough knowledge and experience to act right in different social situations. As a result, they might get into a “bad” company and the level of terrorism will increase. Furthermore, when both parents need to go out to work, they have to leave their children with babysitters, which is also may be dangerous. For instance, there are a lot of examples of violence among babysitters. It can cause such serious problems among children as stress, anxiety. Finally, I would

On one hand everyone have to have freedom of their own thoughts. It does not metter, what people think about, noone can control it. Only way, that people react, is important. We are all free thinking and expressing our own thoughts, because it is only way people can live and communicate.


On another hand is government policity and there fears about changing of people's politition thoughts. There are lots of examples in history about controlling people medium(what people can watch, listen or read). Usually it was unreal to controll all content, that people was taking and artists were always versus it.

We must be free in our own thoughts and artists should not be controlled by government. It is our right for freedom. Goverment should only controll our activities (resault of our thinging).

This pronlem is becoming more and more serious in our days so it is important to take some measures to solve it. These essay will provide some causes of this issue and outline ideas to tackle it.
First of all, some young people do not have any hobbies and interests so to make their lifes a little bit more exciting they start to break rules. For example, if parents are busy at their work and sometimes work overtime, there is nobody to take care after their child. As a resuit, these kids do what they want like watching TV, playing computer games and so on. After that they can go for a walk so as to make his life wore exciting and to commite some crimes like stealing money or food from the shop especially if his patents do not give him any pocket money. Nevertheless, This problem can be simply tackled. Parents should organize some extra activities for their childen and to make sure they are busy enough. On the other hand, teachers working at schools can forge some clubs of interest like English learning or History extra classes.
Furthermore, Some children do some bad things listening to their friends, classmates or somebody who is older than they are. for example,if a child wants to make some new friends who are older that he is, he can mug an old woman and steal her money in order to be respected by his new friends. In that case, parents should know every single friend of his child and to be sure that they do not have a negative impact on his kid while teachers should to pay more attention on relationships in theit class.

 On the one hand, some people think that there is no need to make equal number of male and female students for a certain classes because they have different abilities to learn the subject. In particular, it is assumed that one very good at math, physics and so on, and give are very likely to be a good at literature, art and etc.
On another hand, there is also a known fact that nowadays there are many professional sienticts in different fields and it is also does not depend on on the gender, in another words, gires as well as boys show excellent results in any subject, so there is no correlation with subject and gender.

Overall, I agree with this opinion, because I believe in it. The creative artists must be given the freedom to express their good ideas.


The first hight that needs  to be said is the majority of people  think that creative artists must have big talant and they have created ideas. Therefore they made wonderful pictures, fantastic music and great film, say beautiful phrases and words. The beautiful and creative things made good mood and people  become happy. This is main cause of freedom in work of creative artists. Nobody mustn't.

It is clear from the charts, that the most striking feature in transportation by rail is a large proportion of metals – 35% of all, whereas by road only 11%  of goods account for metals. In contrast, food products transportation is nearly two thirds larger by road than by train. Apart from that, the number of machinery delivered by rail is sixfold higher than that by road.

But is it obligatory to fight with pirates or we can find another way to solve the problem?
We are living in the century of Internet, so for many people copying and sharing files is a daily routine. Must they be punished for those? I think it is not their fault.
The problem is the web services that sell films, music and books are not always comfortable for users. For example, two years ago buying music for your Iphone was a long process and free downloading was more easy and quick for users. But now there is a service called Apple Music which helps you to downoad legal music for a small fee. Most of my friends have changed the way of listening to music since the Apple Music service came to Russia.
The second point is what authors think about pirates. Not each musician, film director or writer concider that those who downloads files illegaly should go to jail. For example, the sons of Russian fantasts brothers Strugatskiye make the web-versions of the books free. The main argument is “who want to pay – will pay”. Many musicians also do the same thing.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we must take it easy. Content-authors will not stay poor. Their fans will always find the way to pay them for work. If they respect authors, of course.

The fist network on which I would like to focus is Facebook.The general trend is correlated with getting older. Thus, the vast majority of the younger generation use Facebook, while the elder generation starting from the age of 65 use it less. Also people of the middle generations are in between by the ammount of usage that network.

The second social network is Instagram.There the situation is really close to the Facebook. However, the elder generation has a tiny persentage of users, while the younger generation has approximately a half of Instagram`s auditory.

Finally, the bar chart illustrates LindedIn`s statistics. It is clear that this network has its own rules. As such, people from the age of 30 to 49 and from 50 to 64 are the most active users. Together they account around 60 percent of auditory, while the younger generation from 18 to 29 and the elder generation from 65 use it less frequently.


To conclude, it is obvious that the younger generation use such networks as Facebook and Instagram more often than the older generation. In these two networks the usage decreases according to the aging of the auditory. In contrast, in Linkedn the usage is more connected to the social status, because that network is usually used by working class to find a job or to communicate with your collegues.

In case of that people, who download pirate content instead of buying original, must be punished.

Unfortunatelly, internet piracy has no respect musicians or film producers. This is very sad, because talented musicians and producers spend their time, patience for making good films and music for people, and it’s normal, that they must have a money reward for their work from sells. Pirates just steal their money in an illegal way. So it is right, that people, who support piracy and download pirate copies must be punished, because they steal content and disrespect tha author.

Actually, in some cases piracy is not as bad as we think about it. Imagine, that you want to read a book, but you can’t buy it in region, where you live. You want to buy it on the internet, but they don’t ship to your country. In that case, you download this book from torrent illegaly. Yes, it is bad, but it is the only way for you to get what you want.

As a musician, I can say, that I respect many musicians, but I rarely buy their content. Why? Because I don’t have enough money to afford every disk I want. Nowadays music CDs are growing in price and you can buy them only if you’re a big fan of a curuent album or band. But you want to listen more music from this musician, and here comes piracy.

So I think, that the best way is to buy original content of different authors that you like the most, but to download illegaly that content, that you can’t get in your country or you just can’t afford.

Nowaday, the big number of young people is becoming crimes. I think that we must understand reasons of this problem and try find solvings of it.
Firstly, there is a necessity in understanding causes of this development. In fact, economic and financial meltdowns are serious problems for everybody. Lack of jobs, activities for young is a concequence of the economic problems. If person hasn’t opportunities of legal working or playing, he starts find alternative variants, for example some crime structures. In this case difficult economic’s conditionals lead to increasing number of young adults jointed in crime structure and lack of special places for walking, playing leads to a big percentage of children who start communicate with crimes.
For solving this problem a government, parents and teachers must act. The goverment firstly should stabilize economy because only in stable economy people can look prospects and develop. Also the government must improve conditions of infrastructure for young guys and children because only when they have places for playing can they play enoth and forget about crimes. Parents also need to act. Generally parents are the main models of behaviour for children and sources of knowledges, experiens. Parents can explain bad sides of crime and also can participate in children actions, which is good for their development. Teachers also must create lessons, conversations with young persons.
So, rising percentage of young people in crime is dangerous trend. It bad because it will lead to significant increasing of number of crimes. I believe that the government has the biggest chances to change situation: the government can create good conditions for development, stabilize economy. But parents and teachers also have influence for young. Participation in games, conversations are good.

So, the idea of building sport centers and improving facilities showed up. That caused a lot of discussions in the society: while some people believed it was the best way to make people`s health better, others were not so sure about it. Thus, the question arises: should we increase the number of sports facilities in order to improve people`s health?
In my opinion, the answer to this question is definetely yes. First of all, people would get a better access to different fitness clubs and sport centers just because their number would be growing. It is known, that many of us are not so active only because there are not so many places to visit. Moreover, people would see by their own eyes how sport changes people. They certainly would like to take sport activities more if they have a close rote model living in the neighbourhood, not on the Internet or TV.
However, some people claim that increasing the number of facilities for fitness would not help. The first argument is that it is still quite expensive to visit a sport center, for example, and not so many people can afford it. The second argument is that the key factor of changing the situation with the public health is making good for them. More buildings are not the solution in this case.
To conclude, I would like to say that, despite all the counter arguments, I strongly believe that developing sport facilities would affect people`s health very much.

In this essay I will introduce some major reasons for this trend and related problems. To begin, there are various reasons for parents to spending less time at home. Firstly, in the past most of the work were connected to home, but with idustrialisation and the development of modern technologies a lot of new distant workplaces were open. For example, peasants needed to work on manufacturies in order to provide their family with enough food supplies and shelter. Secondly, today a substantial part of families are nuclear and usually have up to two children. It means that now siblings or grandparent do not help with chidlren’s upbringing, so parents have to seek for additional help from nurses, that require more money. Moreover, bringing up the child is becoming more expensive than ever and not every family can afford only one working parent. As the time spend with a child decreases, a lot of problems arises. If parents do not spend enough time with children, when they cannot control him or her. This can lead to smoking, drinking alcohol or even drug addiction outside the home. Another problem is psychological, it has been proved that the amount of time spend with the mother in the childhood is closely related to future mental state and even future income. To sum up, in the developed countries parents tend to spend less time with their children because of work. There are several problems related to this trend, so solutions have to be found to prevent this problems.

Many dispect arguments has been said for positive and negative sides of view. I will examine some of this arguments and give my own opinion – should countries share and sell their food to each other or not.

First of all, it is obvious that export of nourishment and another needs has good influence on developing economy of every country, their relationship friendly policy and so on. This is how world developed in a first place. The second benefit of producing food not only for your own population, but for others too is that it works both ways, therefore people will eat more kinds of meals, they will have more variety of food on their tables, more vitamins, try new taste experience. 

The breakdowns of food selling outside the country exist too. For instance, with products (fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, etc) diseases spread. Without food moving between countries there will be more isolation and many lives will be saved. Next disadvantage of importing food a lot is that government needs support its own fermers by giving them more places on markets, so it should be partly free from oversed sellers. 

Considering all views on this problem, I believe that the topic is right. Countries should build their policy in import and export carefully, so their economy would stay unharmed and could develop properly.

As for me, I can say, that we all use pirates copies of films and music in our own life. When we have not enought money to go to cinema wasthing new film, we can also do it sitting at home, by Internet.

Now our life is going around Technical equipment and Internet technologys. So we all have a lot of opportunities to share with friends all information we like. So why can’t we share films or music we like not only with our friends, but to all Internet users?

According to my opinion, people who download copied files, instead of buying the original discs, shouldn’t be punished, because Internet gives them this opportunity.

Personally I agree with this view, beacause there is no effect in the case when you watch sport. Of course you may enjoy watching it on TV,or if it's at live you may go wild or boo in the stadium, especially when you're a fan of sport.

Obviously, there are a lot of diseases caused by computer technologies deeply involved in our lives. These technologies might have a bad impact on a person’s eyes, heart, quality of sleep and a number of other organs and vital processes. On the one hand, such difficulties could be solved by prohibiting the computer technologies in everyday life (banning the production of Bluetooth-supporting lightning, doors and pots). Moreover, using computers and digital screens for the learning process could be banned too. However, such a solution might stop the technological progress and make our lives less comfortable.

So, on the other hand, the technology might be accepted and considered as a part of modern everyday life and made more eco-friendly. That could be reached by using solar energy and demonstrate all the data on a retina-screen, which is less harmful for eyes. Nevertheless, it is impossible to reconstruct all the aspects of our modern life without using as much technology as today, so it would be much easier to make technology more healthy, and at the same time continue to develop its technical characteristics. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that the widespread use of modern technology has a huge disadvantages which is affecting the users’ health in a harmful way, however, there is a variety of disputable solutions of this problem that could be taken into consideration by ordinary people and by huge concerns managins the rechines production as well.

This tendency is caused by a range of reasons and social problems, that still exist in our society. In this essay I would name several causes of juvenile crime and would try to point out measures that adults can be taken to diminish the number of crimes committed by teenagers.

Firstly, as consumption has a prestigious role in modern society, many teenagers, especially ones from poor and working class families, realize that their parents are not available to buy them expensive gifts, and choose breaking the law as means of getting money they need to buy expensive and cutting-edge gadgets and technical devices as well as fashionable clothes. Secondly, due to widespread availability of Internet access and popularity of different sources of information, which portray crimes in a positive light, as acts of courage and gaining respect among peers and among some specific social layers. There do exist a number of movies which depict criminals as rich and powerful men, living adventurous and dangerous lives. There are some video games, such as GTA or Mafia series, which provide an opportunity to play as a member of a gang as well.

However, there are some actions that can be made to improve the current situation with juvenile crime. First of all, teenagers should be aware of the punishment that awaits them if they break the law. They should realize that there is no ""Save/Load"" option in real life and that they take full responsibility for their unlawful deeds and actions. Besides, parents and school teachers should pay attention to adolescents' aspirations and help them to choose an suitable career, explaining them that the only way of achieving financial stablility and prosperity is getting education and hard work during all the life.

In conclusion I would like to say that there are several inevitable causes of growth in the number of crimes committed by young people, however, the current situation can be improved provided parents and teachers express the willing to help their children and students to live a decent and lawful life.",50,2,0

It is easy to observe that climat in Brazil is much softer and comfortable than in Yakutsk, Russia.
The temperature in Rio de Janeiro stayes at point of aproximately 25 degrees the whole year. The highest temperature it has ever reached is 30 degrees in January and the lowest - about 18 degrees in July.
According to the graph we can also make a conclusion that the difference between average maximum amd minimum temperatures in Brazil usually doesn't get wider than 8 degrees.
The highest difference that is shown in graph is about 9 degrees in July.

The second graph illustrates quite obviously, that the climate in Yakutsk is less comfortable and soft.
It is very easy to conclude that the average difference between season temeratures is very dramatic.
The tempreture reaches its' lowest point in January with about -40 degrees.
Then it starts to climb rapidly, increasing by aproximately 15 degrees every month, until it reaches its' pick with 20 degrees in July. The difference between minimum and maximum temperatures is not that obvious during winter season; for example it is only about 5-7 degrees in January and December.

In different times and different countries the bonnels for creative expressions varies. There are cultures that almost completely restrict any kind of creativity in a certain domain. 
In my opinion, the given question is rather political. From government's point of view, any type of expression freedom is dangerous. To be creative means to think out of a box. Thus, there is as clear danger for political stability of a country if the idea of some soirt of revolution sporeads via publicly acesible objects like pictures, music or films. The main problem is that it spreads extremely fast. 
On the other hand, I find inappropriate for government to influence the creative artists who do harm to the political situation. Such artists must be given freedom to express their ideas as those ideas can be a valuable heritage for future generations. 
There is no way for artists to have an absolute freedom and share their pitentially dangerous ideas with society. Before publicating some of the work, the information has to be censored. However, this process may erase some very important details for future history, so an option to save a copy of uncensored version for private viewing only is a good solution. 
Nowadays there is no clear control of expressing freedom. Thanks to the new technologies everybody can share his thoughts via the internet, the area which is very hard to control by government. China is an example of a country, where government created a special facility to control the internet and detect the dangerous ideas, when those are only being born. The results are outstanding, the were no serious political issues during the last twenty years. 
In conclusion there is no way on man to have an absolute freedom in a society as it is always potentially dangerous for the society itself. Any freedoom leads to the problems to be appeared sooner or later. I think the creative expression has to be strictly controlled for the safety of people.

The thing is that young people in the developing world have much more freedom than earlier.
In addition to this, the world has become much more violent than it used to be. Firstly, teenagers and young adults today are opressed by mass media, especially the Internet. Social networks have become an important part of everyone’s everyday life, thus it is easy to manipulate people. As long as youngsters do not have enough experience, it is easier to influence their behaviour and benefit their naiveness.
Secondly, there is a trend to a rise in amount of violence presented in videogames and films, TV programmes and news. As a consequence, youngsters take violence in everyday life as granted and do not consider committing a crime to be a great problem.
Moreover, drugs have become one of the greatest problems we face today. Young people easily become a victim of illegal business, thus becoming a puppet in the hands of real criminals.
Nevertheless, teachers and parents can help their children cope with these problems by educating them from the very early age. I believe the stories about their own experience will actually help to imagine what can crimes result in. What is more, it is important that youngsters knew how are criminals punished.
To sum up, young people today need to get much more attention from adults. It is of utmost importance to shape a strong consciousness as early as it is possible in order to prevent the growth in number of young criminals and further achieve a visible decline.

I believe that charity of different levels improves our world so students which help to homeless people or grow up trees in park make our country better. Moreover, every volunter will have great live experience. They can communicate with other people and make new friends. 
Moreover, if students organise some sport activity they increase physical states of themselves and they friends. In my opinion, very small number of people take part in charity, for this reason we must attract students to this area.
Nevertheless, this kind of compulsory part of high school programmes take a lot of student time’s. They can have problem with study and geting of new knowledge. People suppose some of student want to work and earn own money, but they will be waste they time . In addition, some student afraid of responsibility and have problem in conversation with surrounded people. They have trouble in unpaid community service.
I think we can grow adults from children only in charity organization, because they feel problems of our worlds and they can change these bad area of lives. Of course. It isn’t easy to add community service on high school program, but some years later student will understand usefull of it.

Sometimes poor behaviour even becomes the main cause of the catalysaton for being expelled. There are several obvious reasons to explain this situation, such as low discipline, problems in children’s families and no proper inspiration for school boys and girls. 

Low discipline in schools tends to result in poor behaviour. The pupils who are not controlled properly might imagine that they are allowed to do unappropriate things(such as bullying other classmates) and never set punished for this. That is why it is my strong opinion that behaviour problems should be solved first of all by repairing discipline.

Another reason for the problem is misunderstanding in many families which can lead to disasterous consequences. Families in which parents are busy with themselves or spend all their time trying to make both ends make are very unlikely to take time to play and talk with their children. Such family dramas may take a strong psycological effect on children who start to smoke, drink and break discipline at school. To my mind, at every single school there should be a trained children psychologist who really do something and not just pretend to work as it often happens.

Lack of inspiration and, consequently, lack of motivation to study is also a huge factor which does distract children from studying properly and takes to the bad side of discipline-breakers at school. It is my belief that the problem can be solved by revision of school cirriculum and methods of teaching. Special attention should be paid to pupils off 5-6 grades, because it is exactly the time when a lot of children lose interest in education as it begins to get more difficult and complicated. 

Overall, we traced some factors which result in pupils’ haphazard behaviour in schools. It is clearly that there must be paid much more attention than it does now in future because no question concerning children as our common future, should be ignored.

And the second chart shows the per cent of employer support students of each age are given.
In the first chart we can see that the older students are the les of them study for career and the more for interest. So, the number of students under 26 studying for career is four times as high as the same number but over 49. And among the number of the students studying for themselves, for interest we can see a steady increase from adolescents to elderly people. 
From the second chart we can assume that the biggest quantity of support is given to employees under 26 and the smallest – to those between 30 – 39. After 26 years there can be observed a slight decrease in the quantity of employer support and after 39 everything is wise – versa. The biggest quantity of support given is around 64 per cent and it is about 30 per cent higher than the lowest point. 
These two charts show that most youngsters study to build a career, whereas the elderly people prefer studying for themselves. And furthermore , this factor is provide also by employers who give most support to the youths.

This is a matter of debate with several strong points both for and against. However, in my opinion, people can not deny that those characteristics have much more influence of their lives than any future life experiences.
Firstly, it is important to take into consideration both aspects: physical and mental. Speaking of physical characteristics we are born with, those can be changed during life, while it is much more difficult to change mental characteristics. Of course you can try to change something in yourself, make yourself better, nevertheless it is extremely rare for a person to change entirly. There are some exceptions talking about extrodinary life experiences, heavy emotional dramas, mental illnesses, but those took place very rare in people’s life.
Another fact I would like to draw attention to is that we often are guided by the characteristics we are born with while going through any experience, even if we do not notice this. (As a fact, people can change a bit when going through adolesense, but after that if we do not feel the desire to change we usually do not.) Thus the characteristics we are born with influence even our life experiences sometimes.
To sum up, I suppose that the characteristics we are born with have a great influence on us and our lives. However, there are some exceptions when other factors become more important.

It is a controvetial question whether governments have to set laws against air travelling. I completely disagree with the opinion that these laws should be introduced.
Personally, I consider that air travel is extremely important for businessmen and people in work because of globalization people more fluent in their movements, so they can easily go to another country thanks to planes. People need it, as usually they need to get international experience, to have new practice, communicate to foreign collegues. Moreover, more and more companies became international with filials in different regions, so people cannot lose time on transport in solving company's problems and they need a high speed means of transport.
Moreover, planes are significant transport for leisure activities. All people wish to travel and to explore new places for themselves. If it can be easily done on one materic, it would become a problem to go from Russia to America, for example. Without planes people would to travel by train, bus, ship, boat and on foot, which is both hard enough and pretty expensive. I can say with confedence that all members of my family adore to travel by planes, as it really convinient. 
Anyway, governments can introduce laws against air travelling. They can increase the prices on this type of trip and take much taxes from it. However, I strongly believed that it would be more effective if they concentrate on the problem in general and try to solve it by modernization the plants sources of energy, by making scientists to do their best on this question.
To sum up, air travelling is an essential part of people's lives all over the world, so it would be wrong and cruel not to let them to make such trips both for work and for rest. In my opinion, governments should not close their eyes on the problem of pollution and global warming, but they should develop innovative ways to deal with it, not by sacrificing the air travelling.

There are a lot of sources on the Intentent where everyone can download any film or any music album he or she wants. As the result, people in film and music industries lose a lot of money, suffering from these illegal downloaders. And now the controversial idea of punishing Internet users who download this content is becoming more and more popular. But I think it’s too cruel to think that these action by users is a theft.

Of course, there are some arguments for punishing those people. In fact, this meassure is the only one that can make this kind of persons buy the original disks or pay for some streaming services. Blocking the websites is not so useful because there are a lot of routes how to overcome these blocks, for example vpn-services or some computer programms that change your Ip-adress. Moreover, the punishing measure would territy those users who share the pirate content, because if even the consumering of this files is punished, what the Goverment can do with them? But it seems that those arguments are good only for businessmans from the industry and their lobbists in authorities not for the whole society.

Firstly, the punishment for downloading such a content means that authorities controll the Internet in many ways. It opposites the spirit of freedom, which is, as for me, a very important characteristic of the Internet. Secondly, there is a philosophic question: it there art for artists or for everyone in the world? Of course there may be very different answers. But the entering of that punishment kills this question at all. I think that everyone has the right to decide it by himself, not by a group of politicians. Finally, such kind of actions of authorities may cause a massive disagreement in the society.

Personally I don’t want to see the unhappines of people with it and their possible reaction. This reaction may be dangerous, like not very peacefall demonstrations against this punishment.

So, of course, there is a big problem of illegal content on the Internet but I don’t think we should punish people who download it. The society must find other ways to prevent such cases and I think those ways should be much more friendly to simple Internet users.

There is an opinion that, the results of scientific progress are likely to have negative impact on people's lifes. In particular, technologies can cause diseases.
To begin with, the most famous results of technological progress, the computers, have a detrimental effect on sight. Individuals spending many hours in front of computers' monitors tend to wear glasses. Moreover, wrong posture, while working with computer for long hours, could badly affect backspine. Furthermore, people are surrounded with a lot of electronic devices everyday. As electronic produces electro-magnetic wave, it is likely to poorly affect tissues of our body. For example, it is prooved by scientists that, talking via cellphone a lot could couse brain cancer.
Although, the situation is not that desperate. Of cource there are some ways of reducing the harmful effects of modern technologies. First of all, people could limite the time they spend in front of the computer or talking via phones. In particulary, scientists recommend limit the time spent on phone calls by 30 minutes per day. In this way the probability of causing a brain cancer fall dramatically. The other way to decrease the number of health problems is the scientific progress. New technologies help to improve electronic devices, so that to make them more safe.
All things considered, ther is no doubt that modern technologies could cause some helth problems. Nevertheless, people can reduce the detrimental effects of scientific progress.

In comparison, while there is more white people in general population of the USA, the figure of non-white prison population outweights.There are almost three white men to every six non-white men in prison. The feasible reason for this can be the fact that the number of white and non-white populations in the USA is slightly equall. In the UK the non-white population makes only a quarter of the whole population. Therefore, it should be said that the non-white population in the USA is three times more than in the UK.

So, it is obvious that there are a lot of international companies that move their businesses to developing countries. In my opinion, this development has both advantages and disadvantages and none of it can outweigh the other. On the one hand, business in poor, developing countries is badly developed because people do not have enough money to start it. So, rich countries with moving their businesses companies help poor ones develop the economic part of their life. Furthermore, with developing economics social and cultural spheres begin to improve too. It may lead to the faster developing of the whole country which was poor in the past but will be rich in th near future. For example, companies will employ local workers what can afford to decrease the level of unemployment. People became richer and can buy products with better quality. So, local businessmen will develop their deals to give the opportunity buy a lot of local products. On the other hand, if there are a lot of international companies in the poor countries, the local business can not develop so fast or can not develop at all because of unnessesary. In this way, poor country may never became richer as it depend on rich country. Big countries use poor ones as a place where they can sell the production or employ a cheap workers. We may notice that it is a circle of poorness or slave. For example, many USA companies move their businesses to developing countries. There are a lot of USA car factories in Russia and other. As a result, we have a bad local car production because the quality of our products much worse and it is hardly changed. To sum up, the process of moving business from rich to poor countries has both positive and negative influence, but it is important to understand that poor and developing countries should be given a support to improve and develop world business as a whole and different social, politic, economic and cultural spheres.

Firstly, unnecessary air travel should be prevented. Nowadays the possibility of air traveling with no point and earning a private airfly has become some sort of luxury. For example, some rich people travel by air when the alternative traveling (eg., by train) is cheaper and faster.

It can be deduced from the first graph that the average maximum temperature in Rio de Janeiro reaches 30 C in January and falls to approximately 25 C in July and then with small shifts begins to go up to the same level of about 30 C in December. As for the average minimum temperature in this city, it can be stated that it slowly decreases from January, when it is about 23 C, to July (about 17 C) and increases to approximately 22 C in December.
Speaking of the average maximum and minimum temperatures in Yakutsk, it can be noticed that a rapid rise from about -35 C in January to about 25 C in July is followed by a dramatic decrease back to approximately -35 C in December. At the same time, in January the average minimum temperature usually reaches -40 C, goes up to about 12 in July and falls to -40 in December.
Overall, after analyzing the information provided it can be stated that in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the shifts in the average maximum and minimum temperatures thoroughout the year follow the same pattern with a small decrease from January to July and a smal increase in the later period; a rapid change in the temperatures is witnessed with a noticible increase of it by July and a noticeble fall by December.",70,1,2

Others, however, assume that government should act to restrict these artists.


In my opinion, creative people should not have a complete freedom in expressing their views. First of all, if people will have the right to speak freely, other groups of people may suffer. For example, the racism may be created because of the complete freedom of people to say what they want. On the other hand, some diplomatic problems between countries can be caused by disrespectful and inappropriate films, pictures, music; in other words, it can result in important and even dangerous political issues.


Nevertheless, there are some people who think that a complete freedom should be given to creators so they can express their thoughts. They assume that in the free society people should have right to speak out loud their ideas. Moreover, some argue that there could not be any creativity if there are some rules for artists to follow. However, they failed to realize that lack of respect to other people resulted in any type of creation. Sometimes can cause a serious problem connected with nationalism.


All things considered, although many people think that creative people should express their thoughts in any way they want, I strongly believe that some restrictions should be made for people creating any artwork; people should respect each other and do not doubt each other's rights, even if they have different views on any issue. Any artistic creation should be a piece of pure art, not the proposal.

In my oppinion modern technologies cause an increasing number of health problems. They are mostly connected with vision, our back and obesity. If we understand modern technologies as computers and smartphones then I think that they really do harm. Firstly, computers and work connected with seating cause less active lifestyle. It means that there are less callories spent and there is less blood cerculation. These are the causes of obesity. The other reason why smartphones and computers do harm to us is that they spoil our vision if we use them too much.
On the other hand some people say that modern technologies are able to improve lifes of many people who were not able to deal with their deseases until modern technologies appeard. They suppose that modern technologies develop medicine and in such a way do good to us.

The prominent feature of the data appears to be it's diversification: we are shown not only bare figures of amount of users but also reasons for accesing the social network.

Just by a quick look at the vertical bar chart we can grasp two features in terms of amount of Facebook users.
Firstly we are to admit that there is a significant rise in the percentage of users accesing the social network from mobile devices. In March 2013 amount of such users rose roughly twice as much comparing to the same period of the year 2012. Speaking about another feature of this chart, the total number of Facebook users increased by the year 2013 but actually not so substantially as it was with the amount of mobile device users.

Moving next to another chart -- describing general reasons for using Facebooks -- it is worth noticing that situation describe varies a little bit from the previous chart. Here no such strict conclusions can be made instantly. However, a more detailed look at the chart provides us with the information the the most popular reason for accesing Facebook appeared to be sharing photos and videos. Evenmore this mean also showed the highest growth of it's rate gaining 15% in it's popularity. Interestingly, how all the participants -- all the reasons -- didint show any decrease overall. In contrast to most of the participants, Receiving updates remained the same throughout the period given at the level of 39%. Other reasons for accesing Facebook which are Seeing funny posts and Recieving updates maintained moderate rate of growth by nearly 10%.

Thus, by examining charts given we can conclude that overall popularity of Facebook between years 2012 and 2013 definitely increased by any means. The social net gained a substrantial amount of mobile device users and also we've seen that there were also risings of different intensities by any resons for accesing Facebook. The only exception was shown by Recieving updates mean but still it didnt show any decrease remaining at the same level as it would be in the year of 2012.",70,1,1

Musicians and film producers have huge loses every year. How can we prevent such situations in future?
From one point of view widespread of music and films illegally shouldn’t be stopped. Popular musicians get money from tours around the world: if millions of people like your music, songs,  performances, they will buy ticket on the concert. Practise shows that mostly unpopular singers relates negatively to illegal widespread of their songs, so they don’t have another source of getting money, because their concerts are badly organized and no one buy tickets. Creations of talanted musicians should be acceptable for people of all nations, strates, equally for rich and poor, that’s why they must be free.
The opposition of mentioned point of view says that all high-qualified goods must be payed. The world market of films and songs lost huge amounts of money and even laws can’t stop the process of widespread. People, who take this point of view, put on various restrictions. For example, it is supposed that Internet websites, which accept music, films or other materials, should make all accounts for visitors not free. If you often visit cinemaparks, you can notice that there are a lot of cameras in a hall, where films are watched. That way officials want to stop activity of cameramen, who take a copy of film in the cinema and download to websites for a payment.
To sum up, the process of widespread can be stopped, however, musicians, writers or other creative people can attract by the quality of creations. So, if songs are popular, people will visit concert even for a big ticket price. If film is breath-taking and unusual, unique, people will come to cinema to watch a masterpiece on a big screne.

First of all, it is a wide-known fact that by flights, using airplanes the ozone layer becomes thinker.

I think, that the procent of advantages is bigger that disadvantages. I believe, that factories polute our Earth much more than air travel. The fact is factories works all days and all  night and they are bigger than planes, that is why they are more dangerous. Thirdly, the number of cars, which are polluting the world every day, are increasing day by day, so air travel is influencing global warming less than cars, that are everywhere.
In addition, I believe that governments should not take part in air travel. A lot of people work in this area, if governments reduce the amount of air travel, big number of workers will need to find new job. My next point is developing countries, which are survive only because of tourism.

If a painting is not realy intime it will not be better with the imaqge or idea ina head of its creator. There are some time or space limits which could not be avoid.
My opponents may think that masterpieces won't be born in such strict conditions. There is a blog of famous russian artist Lebedev, where he is writing, that some rules are necessary. His organisation works are well-known, however, there are rules in his company. First of all, he does not care about the time, in what his employees come to work, but there are deadlines and the time restrictions in which the work must be finished. The artists can ware that they like but the clothes must be clkean and nit wierd or outstanding if it can shock others. The work place should be organized differently, like in Yandex. In office they have cookies and couches. However it does not disturbe from work,moreover informal atmosphere help people to generate new ideas. 
To sum everything up, I want to say,that in any job there are rules which could not be avoided, but some freedom in creative professions can lead to the better results.

From the following data we can conclude that Facebook remains the most popular social net. More than a half of respondents in each age group use it. Moreover, in the age group “18-29” approximately 9 out of 10 people are Facebook users.
Instagram is also quite popular among young audience. More than a half of young americans enjoy what the net offers. But success among older people is not that great. Only a quarter of respondents from the group “30-49” use the photo-sharing service, while people older than 65 barely use it.
Regardless of difference in the amount of users, Facebook and Instagram share the common pattern of engagement dependent on age, which is “the younger the group, the larger the share of users”
In contrast to that, LinkedIn demonstrates flatter distribution of engagement. We can’t see any obvious coinsidences between the age of a group and the share of users. General conclusion to the graph might be that the leading network keeps its strong position by targeting the younger audience.

On the one hand, all people in the world make mistakes, but they studies on their fails and improve themself. If sport judges banned athletes from professional competition for the rest of their lives it will be broke all life of athlets, because it was a way of eean money for family! No doubt, people should think about moral side of problem. Also, no everyone can achieve a professional level of career and situation, when one mistake can destroy all hard-working goals is horrible! There are many situations and examples when coach give illigal drugs to athletes without their opinion, because their main goal is victory and health of sportsman on the second plan. In such situations for athletes there are not other ways.
On the other hand, rules for all are similar. Sportsmens should follow honour game. Serious banned will be good example for other athletes. This is a good lesson for other people, which can prevent using of illegal drugs in sport. The conditions in sport should be common for all. To my mind, it is necessary to give people a second chance. But if mistake will be repeat, athletes should be banned from compenting professionally for the rest of their lives

People themselves put into place surrounding by gadgets and other products of modern technology. Our world is full of various waves, created by technical devices. And they dramatically influenced on us and our health.

Furthermore our workplace in many cases reduces our health/ Long sitting and working with computer without break and taking special exerces can spoilt somebody ability to see, because put eyes are not prepared for this hardship.

There are various ways to solve such problems. Firstly, people should start from themselves, they actually need to want to solve the problem. Humanity must always think about their own safety. We must remember all consequanses of using technologies. For instance, having a break every 30 minutes while working on the computer and doing special exerces for eyes. Also people can change their place of living onc a year for relax from influence of technolodies. Cities is full of this harmful influence and we can move to countryside sometimes. Secondly our government should improve health care of their citines according to appeareance of new damage from technology.

Many people stands on the position that the lack of attention of teachers and parents causes this situation, however, there are another angle of view. In this essay several aspects of this problem and possible variants of their solutions would be provided.
To start with, the problem of rising amount of murders and robberies may be affected by the Hollywood action films. The most popular genre in the XX century includes all the aspects of dark life. Moreover, in the three quarters of them main characters are members of mafia or want to join it. Parents or teachers may try to attend kids to listen to a classic music, watch ballet or participate in a chess championship, but the way if modern life is obviously contained from quiet work and does not include any physical actions, where young people could find adrenalin. As it seems to modern researches, the only variant is to show children in your own example that cruelty is not the unique variant of achieving their goals, moreover, in the most cases it leads to imprisonment or even death.
The other side of the problem is the prejudice against young people, when the attitude to them is negative without any previous foundation. Unfortunately, such an attitude causes real problems for the young people, who began to believe that they can not be good ore they do not need to be such people, because others would not believe them in any cases. Such discrimination is popular in the western countries, especially in Northern America and Europe against the black and Mexican citizens. Teachers and parents should grow tolerance in the growing generation, if people literally want to live in the next several years. Nowadays, we are standing on the border of the third World War, which is shown greatly by figures of crimes, where the young are participated.
To sum up, it should be said that this problem definitely significant and actual in our modern society and every government, teacher, parent and just person should as much as he can to solve it, because it leads us to a really dystopia.",70,2,3

It is not a secret that governmet and also people themselfes should at least try to solve these problems.
One of the biggest enviromental problem is air polution.
It is already proved that air travel plays an important role in polluting air. So many people believe, that reducing the amount of air travel will help to make the air cleaner.
Unfortunetely, this question is very complicated; it does not seem possible to have this question answerde immediately.
On te one hand, air pollution could be mortal to nature and, therefore, human as well, since it leads to global warming.
On the other hand, we should also pay attention to other factors, because air travel is not the only source that pollutes air and enviroment.
To my mind, air travel is overestimated. I shoul admit, that it is very comforatble, since it is usually the fastes way to travel.
But in my opinion, there are lots of destination one could get to without ussing plain.
For example, a person, while traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburgh, could ude a train or even a car.
Fossil fuels and gases provided by car lead to pollution as well, but compared to air pollution caused by air transport. it is less harmful.

Athough we should use alternative transport more often, the gouvernment should not force us not to use air transport.
At least because there are many places that are impossible or simply veru hard to reach without using a plain.
We shoul keep in mind, that air pollution is much more that air travell only.
There are so many factors, that create harm to nature and enviroment.
As I've said earlier, car gases, even smoking and breathind produce carbon dioxide and, therefore, pollute air.
But the biggest harm is, of coarse, provided by factories, especially the ones that produce metal and energy( from oil for example).
The government has to try decreasing number of these kind of factories, or use alternative ways of energy and working with metal.
Building nuclear power station instead of oil/gas power station could be very helpful, since it was many times Scientifically proved to be more enviromentally friendly.
As a whole, it is important to keep in mind that solving this enviromenatal problem should be priority now, specially when we talk about air pollution.

To conclude, we deffinately should use air transport less, sinse it pollutes air and causes to huger enviromental problems.
However, we mustn't forget, that there are more significant factors, which lead to air pollution.
So probably, it woud be more helpful to try getting rid of them, since they can easily provide even more enviromental problems.",65,2,2

This essay agrees that we are surrounded by high technology everywhere and it might be very harmful for our health. Firstly, this essay will describe some illnesses people have due to the use of high technology and secondly, the essay will offer few solutions for such health problems. 

Initially, nowadays people become overweight because they do not spend much time outdoors but relax or even communicate with their friends through the Internet using various social networks. Also, modern technology made our lives much more simple and gave us the access to everything we need, that is why people became lazier and non-athletic. For example, it was reported in “The Times” that only 30 percent of the US citizens prefere walking instead of playing video games at home, despite others consider electronic devices to be the best for spending the free time. 

Moreover, modern technology is rather useful and helpful for people but their influence should be controlled. Firstly, the government might make some healthy advertisement to encourage citizens spend much time outdoors and do sports. Secondly, people may reduce the time they spend in social networks in order not to become overweight. For instance, the results of our university experiment shows that nowadays government support through TV-shows help people and motivate them become helthier. 

In conclusion, this essay supports the idea that modern technology causes many health problems in our lives but the mankind can solve them by few steps together.

Local firms and family businesses can not compete with their professional concurents. In this essay I would like to dwell upon the issue that this tendency can lead to equality and high lever of quality in every part of the world.

To start with, there are a lot of countries and towns with absolutely different levels of life. In developing countries people can count only on the fairness of local businesses. So, there are no standarts of their production, they need simply belive that this milk or meat was kept in a right way. On the other hand, in top large businesses this is done for you for sure. Huge number of managers examine all the tecnologies that are used while making a product, so, in each part of the world this product would be the same, would be tested in advansed.

Also, returning to the previous point, you can be sure that you would find the very product you need even in the other continent. When you come to the famous fast food restoraunt, you know in advanced what you can eat and you do not waste your time.

On the other hand, there are those who claim that killing small businesses we kill the culture. This opinion partly has a right to exist. People really do not try to find out something new, they automatically choose the product to which they are used to.

This thought may be valid, but for the economy the concurence is the major starting point. Well, the strongest survives. This provides us with the best products.

To sum up, in my opinion large businesses have better qualities than their smaller collegues. If the business is really strong, it will be popular. The more people work in this sphere for our wealth - the better.",65,2,2

From my point of view, that kind of facilities have to be free for everyone, so that I absoulutely disagree with this statement.
To begin with, musicians and producers offer their creativity for rather expensive price. In this case fans would rather searching illegal pirate copies to listen to the music or to watch the film. They may browse the site which they do not know who created by, and watch adorable movie or song. It does not mean that the fan is a thief and the fan can not imagine that may be punish.
Moreover, people who make music and films have an opportunity to organize concerts and meetings. As a rule, tickets are extremely expensive. People who are addicted to their creativity but do not have enough money to buy the ticket for the entry would like to download track surfing the Internet so creators must do their work available for everyone not to lose fans. Now it is really common, stars make something just for money and all works are similar and do not have any individuality. So why people should waste money for downloading anything that have now differences? The Fans do not have to be punished for their crazy love.

And it could be better to spend them on solving society problems.
In my opinion, there could be some arguments for both points of view. Of course, space exploration is the crutial thing in terms of the development of humanity. Today we are facing some problems, which could make out living on the Earth impossible: for example, overpopulation, climat changeing, problems with drinking water. The serch of the other planets, wich are suitable for human beings is one of the most important problems for space exploration. So, I suppuse, that people who think that investigation of space is less important than urgent problems, do not think about it in the perspective way.

But I could also agree with people who argue that we should pay more attention on today's problems, such as enviromental problems and on-going wars in the Arabic region. Environmental issues are the reasons why space investigation is so important. The faster we start to care more abot the ways of useing energy and water, the more time we have to live on the our birth planet.
I aslo think, that poverty is one of the main reasons of society and environmental problems. People, who do not have enought money for everyday needs will never think about the economy of natural resouces. That is why we should figure out some ways to increase the average level of live.
All in all, space exploration is not less important than urgent problems in society, but we should allways look for the balance and not forget about the Earth's problems.",60,2,1

The decision is should be made: to ban athlets cought using them for a limited time or to definitely exclude them from competitions. This essay will discuss both points of view and find out the most suitable.
To start with, banning athlets for a confined period is obviously more humane. A person caught using prohibited drugs may understand it was awfull and make a remorse. Despite some athlets use them, they apparently need to be tought that it is a serious crime in sports. Sport doctors and other medicine personnel of teams should be blamed for allowing and even not knowing about athlet's illegal drugs using, of course.
However, there are people that think that sports societies should prohibit these athlets for the rest of their lives. This point of view is very strict, althoug the most evident solution to illegal drugs problem is a total ban of persons of such a reprehensible conduct. It may be argued that one who was once caught should be frightened of being caught again - this will predestine that culprit will never attempt to cheat once more. Evidently, the latter statement is fallacious: the one who used a drug in his or her past is likely to do it one more time. The sound argument for banning culpable athlets forever is that sport society needs to be cleaned from those who do not attain sport's moral code. This strict desicion will obviously maintain guaranted level of honest competition.
To conclude, two points of view have been discussed: one was to ban athlets using prohibited drugs for a period of time and other - to disqualificate them for the rest of their career. My opinion is that the latter is, despite being significantly rigid, the best solution to the issue of illegal drugs using. That's why I totally agree with it.

It is very comfortable to listen to your favourite musicians and it doesn’t matter where you are. However, this process also has a negative effect. Now, it is really hard to fight with illegal copying and sharing of music. So, should the usage and production of pirate copies be considered as a crime and theft or not?
First of all, let us consider the arguments of the supporters of such opinion. the main argument is based on the term “intellectual property”. Some people think that music or film production is a very hard process that requires a set of skills and talent. So, when someone uses other people’s music or films without the right to do that, he abuses other people’s rights. That’s why some people think that pirates should be punished.
On the other hand, there are some people who disagree with this opinion. Mostly, they also support libertarian and anarchist political ideologies. Nevertheless, why do they support free copying and sharing of music? There are some reasons for that. One of the most important is that they think that music and films cannot belong to a specific person or a company. They say that music and films belong to the whole human kind. Also, these people think that this is against human nature to make money in such areas as music and movies.
In conclusion, it is needed to say that the opinion given in the second paragraph seems more correct because each work should be paid. Another indicator is that the law of many countries is already protect music and film makers against pirates.

From the other point of view, those are hardly bound. Personally I think that there is an obvious link and support the idea of developing sport and this essay will explain why. To begin with, any sport facility  the visitor’s health, no matter what sport they do. Moreover, sport encourage people to change their lifestyle and habits: to accept a healthy diet, to walk more, to go in for active sports during holidays such as beach volleyball rather that lying on a beach and so on. It is hard to combine smoking and sports. Furthermore, going to a sports centre simply leaves no time for lying in front of a TV and procrastinating: it is always involves movement, action, makes one fit. The opposing side of the idea claim that increasing the number of sports facilities has little effect. Nobody may be interested in the idea and start training. Also, going in for sport does not necessarily mean that one stops smoking, drinking alcohol simultaneously, etc. However, they do not consider that good social advertising and other national programmes are not excluded! Moreover, as already mentioned, sport provokes to lead a better lifestyle. To sum up, I am convinced that improving the sports system means improving the national health. Due to the listed reasons this conclusion seems inevitable and obvious.

But on the other hand, the expand of this oppotunities brings negative influences for producers of films and musicians, because today rising of coping and sharing this products decreases producers’ income.
Firstly, the main reason, why behavior of coping, sharing and downloading illegal files has to be punished, is that hard-work of producers and musicians do not bring them enough money.
For example, people who do others jobs have stable salary for part of work, wich they do and if their boss does not give enough money salary for them, they will change their jobs.
On the other hand, the high oppotinities for download these files allows poor people watch this movies and lisen this music too.
Secondly, people who buying the original version pay their own money for it and other people have to do the same thing. If people do not buy the original movie of film, they break roles of morality, because if one person pay money for thing, the other person have to pay for this too or she or he will be a thif.

While others claim that it would not have that impact and suggest to take other measures in consideration as well. I think this problem rather complicated, so let’s look into it more carefully. On the one hand, sport is very important for being fit and healthy. First of all, it helps us to be in a good shape and reduce extra fat in our organism that can be harmful and cause some desieses. Secondly, doing sports can prevent people from having bad habbits such as smoking and drinking alcohol. Finally, sport activities make people’s organism stronger in fighting different viruses that can be dangerous for their health and lives. On the other hand, sports facilities can not solve all the problems. At first, we need to develop and improve such spheres as farmocology and the system of medicine care, that are also crucialy important for mantaining people’s health. Moreover, we should protect the environment by solving a great variety of ecological problems. Also we would take care about children and protect them from bad influence of bad habbits.

Firstly, this essay, will discuss the main reason why does it happen nowadays and secondly, it will suggest some of possible solutions to deal with this hurdle.
In my opinion, I think that the main reason why the situation looks like that is because parents of those kids are some kind of laid-back people and they do not pay any attention to the development and behaviour of their children due to their own career growth or even their lazyness. I am not saying that every parent can act like this but I know a lot of families in which child can live on their own whithout any parental regardment. That is why young people can not distinguish which action is bad and which one is good. They start to use drugs or even sell them to get some money and some of them decides to make a robbery or in hard cases they can murder somebody. This fact is really terrifying.
To solve this problem, I would like to suggest government to create some social programs which would be held at schools and universities where children would be taught how to behave in society and would be given a law education of the country where they live. I think that these methods will help them to become good citizens of their contry.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we need to look after our young generation in a proper way because they are considered to be our future and we need to give them the model of how to behave in the society and then the situation with commiting crimes will change a lot in the near future.",65,2,0

Should people who copy and share music or films on the internet be punished?

Of course people who work in music or film industry get a huge amount of money from selling their production. But no one exept them won’t feel bad if copying and sharing music or films become legal. In my opinion, the government should allow pirate files in Internet as there are many people who cannot buy the original discs and use Internet to listen to music or to watch film.

On the other hand, musicians can make money on concerts and producers can have money from selling merchandise. Despite the fact that there are a large number of pirate copies, I think that it is not a large problem, because a lot of people still go to cinema and buy CD discs. For example, the sites like Kinopoisk.ru show that a lot of people prefer to go to the cinema instead of watching film at home. So producers got their money back. Of course if pirate sistem doesn’t exist they can earn much more but I consider that they have enough money. The same situation with musicians. For instanse, the famouse Russian singer Shnurov takes for the ticket to his concert at least 3 thouthands rubles. He always connects a lot of people at large stadiums. So I am sure that he is not against the pirate copies of his music in Internet. 

In conclusion I want to write that I am strongly believe that people who download pirate files should not be punished as musicians and producers can get money from other parts of their production. And should remember that many people from all over the world still use the cinema and like to listen music on discs.

Other people think that downloading pirate content is some kind of steal, that is why it is illigal.
From my point of view, second group of people is right, illegal copies downloading should be punished for the following reasons.
First of all, film producers of musicians spend a lot of money and time to do movie of song. It is very difficult process, because they do something new, develop heir own ideas. There are a lot of examples, which show us that movie makers can invest hundred millons of dollars to make a good film. If people would not pay for the original content film producers will lost their money and they will not make new films.
Secondly, a lot od pirate copies have very bad quality, that is why people can not enjoy music or film as well as original copy. There are a lot of examples, when people watch pirate copy of film in very low quality and that is why they have wrong opinion about this product.
From the other hand, some people dont have enough money to pay for the original content. In this situation people want to entertain themselves.

Obviously, when people have a great variety of sports they can choose it is rather easier to make them do these sports and stay healthy. Moreover, for many people it is really important to have an opportunity to do their favourite kinds of sports close to their homes. That is why the rising number of sports facilities in different areas can inspire people to become more sportive. It is also extremely important to have more sports facilities both for indoor and outdoor sports to make people spend more time outside their houses. On the other hand, increasing number of sports facilities does not always mean increasing number of people who go in for sports. So, other ways of inspiring people to stay healty and keep fit should exist. For example, it can be rising number of healthy food in shops and restaurants. Government and local authorities may use social advertising of social campaigns to increase the popularity of healthy lifestyle. Companies can provide medical insurances and complex medical treatment for their workers to help them to control their health.

A student group consists of only girls, atmosphere becomes stressful which lead to bad marks. For example, my class at school accounts for 20 girls therefore there were gossips and shouts.
The next vital argument necessity of avoiding differences between men and women. A few decades ago, society faced to feminism which lead to various problems. Today, universities are open for everybody and it's wrong to give dishonest conditions for different gender groups.
On the other hand, some of people consider that education isn't essential thing for women because the can't spend time in the wrong way and avoid of making a family and bringing - up children.

Some people may claim that these high numbers are the result of modern society decay, so that young generation has no moral values to hinder their crime. However I claim that this is not most important reason. To me, it is developing technology that lead to the feeling of lesser crime responsibility, thus youngsters are not afraid of punishment any more. What is left to their life mentors is to increase their morality so that in the world of increased crime opportunity it would be inner rightness preventing people from illegal deeds.
On the other hand, many elder people now consider youngsters as a spoiled generation with wrong behaviour and no moral constraints. That is why crime rate surged - that is what they think. However, if we look in the history, there were thousand of similar cases in Ancient Greece, European revification period and etc. It is a human psychology feature to think that subsequent generation are worse than they are, that morality fell sharply during their life.
I personally believe that crime rate grew mainly because of increased crime opportunity. We live in the epoch of developing technologies where it is really easy to rob the bank servers, steal electronic money and even order a crime with the help of illegal websites. For example, Tor is an effective platform for buying guns, distributing drugs and etc. Thus, it became really easy to do illegal things with less chances to be caught.
To conclude, we should return to moral aspect of crime. Governments can no longer prohibit illegal paths blocking the sites, while they will open again somewhere else - it is just a matter of time. A thorough moral remedy should be considered to cure youngsters and the society itself.
Diminish crime reasons, so that the problem would disappear.

The increase will be for about 3 billion of US dollars. However, in other remaining countries the increase will be negligible. For example, in China there were 0,5 billion of US dollars in 2014 and in 2018 there will be only 1 billion of US dollars. Accordingly, the growth will be very slightly and only for half billion.
To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that the predictions about the reduction of popularity of print books will be true for all countries exept Germany and in all countries the ebooks will become popular.This can be the result of such process as globalisation.",65,1,0

It is to give information, to let people know about some changes in other lifes. Moreover, nowadays there are many social groups and public accounts where the spread of human knowledge is a main idea and in the same time way of gaining money.

First of all, this process has advantages for poor countries where the businesses move. It is usefull for these countries, because they do not have enough money to make work places for people, for examples to build factories. International companies make deals with governments of poor countries to make work places on their territory. Moreover, it is useful to them because of this companies will increase these countries. Some huge companies which build cars moving their businesses in poor country help to them to build their own cars. On the other hand, it might cost a lot for their companies. They should educate workers. How to work with difficult equipment. It’s expensive to build factories in this countries because of lack of resources.

There are a lot of other factors, that can attract the public to sports activities. For example, marketing and advertisement. I think every government should make a social advertisements with the native football players or other sportsmen, where they should tell to us about the importance of sport and healthy way of life. Another good way to improve public health is to build stadiums, playgrounds for children. Children is our future, and they should be healthy since their born. To sum up, I can say, that the health and interest to sport is very individual to every person. Only when I would understand the necessary of doing sport, I can make my life healthier.

Today we live in the conditions of globalization and many corporation wide spreaded all over the world, including third world countries. Sometimes they open daughter – companies in poor countries. In my whole opinion, it has positive effect rather than negative for several reasons. Firstly, employing local workers in international companies may be beneficial either for them and for corporations too. Usually poor countries have the top levels of unemployment rates because of the lack of work places. Employing locals to international corporations may solve this problem. A lot of people who suffer from being without work and money will have a  chance of change their lives. Secondly, moving companies to poorer countries may help them to develop. Opening corporation in Kenya, for example, will led to investments to this area. Such countries in Africa have a lot of natural resources which are not used in poorer and beneficial way. Developing third world countries will reduce a difference between countries all over the world. But on the other hand, there can be some problems too. Investments to developing countries may encourage people to move here and create a disbalance between average human resources. Moreover, if company have some problems and become a bankrupt, local workers will have no alternative ways to employ to another work. All in all, in this situation advantages overweigh disadvantages.

It is important to understand how to fight it, and that is why we need to point out the possible reasons of the trend.
First of all, the modern world is largely urbanized. And with urbanization, the era of traditional families passes, giving a way to nuclear modern-type families.
Many of the latter have a single child, and contact with their relatives rarely. As a result, children from these families might not have a close person – that is, a sister, a brother or a grandparent, - to interact with and develop socially. This may give a life to mental problems, making a person socially dangerous.
Another reason behind these crimes may be the rosen popularity of the Internet. Without any doubt, there are plenty of benefits provided by the Internet, such as an ability to communicate with people across a sea, learn almost any information and read any book. Yet, the sense of being connected to the whole world makes a person vulnerable to the words of people trying to verbally offend them, and that may be a motivation for commiting a hate crime, especially if you are young and expressive.
How can the society try to solve this problem? To soften the negative effects that I have written about above, the following could be done.
First teachers at school should be observing closely each child’s psychological state to give them any needed support. Secondly, the parents need to pay close attention to what their children watch and read, on the Internet and beyond, to save them from negative impacts.
Fighting against crimes, it is important to remember to care about people who can potentially commit it.

Whereas some people suppose that athletes should be banned from competitions for a few years, others argue that such sportsmen should be banned forever. This essay will consider both points of view and clarifies author’s own opinion.
So the majority of people believe that athletes, who were caught using illegal meds during the competition should be banned from them, but only for short period of time. From one hand, it is quite reasonable as it might give time to sportsmen who made such a mistake to sort out their priorities and decide whether they want to competite with justice or with cheating. Also, it gives an example for other athletes, what the consequences might be if you are not caught, then you are not guilty. So, the athletes might even try to use illegal drugs again in order to win the competition.
On the other hand, people suggest more strict punishment such as banning from professional competitions for the rest of sportsmen's lives. Such suggestion also has pros and cons. For example, if we ban an athlete who cheated only once forever, his career might be ruined and also his life. We do not know the reasons, why he/she used drugs and cannot judge so confidently. Looking at this from different side, if we do not ban an athlete for breaking the rules at all, we might encourage him/her and others to do it again.
To my mind, it is more reasonable to ban athletes who were caught using drugs for a limited period of time. After that, if they are caught againt, they should be banned forever. I suppose we should give another chance to a person who might just stepped out of the right way.
In conclusion, it must be said that the problem of using illegal drugs in sport is quite relevant these days and should be discussed carefully in order to overcome the consequences.

Also because of planes influence on atmosphere, level of air pollution and global warming rise in future. Furthermore, to my mind, these new laws can be oportunity for science.

They did it for advertising but why we can’t do this in our lives too? Also we can’t forget about our health. Air travel is not very helpful. Some doctors say that you will influenced by some radiation then you are in the sky. Pregnant women are not allowed to travel by plane, is not this a point of harmful influence? On the other hand we can’t forget about human rights. We can travel, can have business in different country, can visit relatives. And government can’t cancel all air travel and close the gates. To conclude, I would like to say that we need to be careful for our planet, our health. And population need to find golden line where our rights and our duties have the same level of importance.

It has become an essential part of our lives, something we can’t have fun of communicate without, but is it really all that good or are there downsides to us using so much of it all the time?

One of the issues that has come to the attention of many with the rise of technology is that it can sometimes cause problems with health and the number of those problems is increasing all the time. 

For instance, due to the nature of the screens that are now a part of almost any technological device and also because of people staring at them for many hours every day, many have started to feel that their eyes tire fasted than usual and because of that the number of problems with eyesight has increased dramatically. 

Another thing that is worth our attention is that people slauch a lot while using computers and smartphones which causes posture problems that are difficult to treat.

One of the ways in what the problem can be reduced is to mind our posture and the time we spend staring at our screens. One should use a comfortable chair while working on computer and try to keep their face 30-40 centimeters from the screen. Another way to deal with this issue is to do regular exercises for eyes and posture, for example, while having small 5-10 minute breaks. This way our eyes and back won’t tire so fast and we will at least have a chance of reducing the damage that technology causes to our health, although probably not eliminate it altogether.

All in all, technology is not something that is always good for us, but it doesn’t mean that we can’t deal with the problems it causes. We just have to adapt to our new reality and act accordingly to make the most of our lives.

But the question is what is happiness?
I don’t think there is a proper way to define happiness. You don’t know what happiness os until you experience it and each time it can be caused differently. Some say money brings you happinness, some say love, but is it truly this simple?
First of all, let’s not forget that all human beings are different, with different values and backgrounds, we were taught differently. So some believe that happiness is something that can’t be bought or made it’s not materialistic – something you can reach or achieve in your life. Love, family, harmony. On contrary, there are people who strongly believe that happiness is in their job, in money they get, in many many houses they can have. Maybe these new shoes will make you happy so you go and buy it.
Another thing is that people of different cultures see happiness in different ways. While the West world is more self-centered, the Eestern is all about collective values. Westerns think of happiness as something that can only be achieved if you succeed in life, Easterns though find happiness in belonging to a community, being a good mother or father, for example, they live as their parents expect them to.
Furthemore, there are different religions with their own perception of happiness, their followers have to agree with these perceptions.
There’s no such thing that can define happiness in a simple word of sentence.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that happiness is a very tricky topic to talk about. It means different things to different people and each one descides what it means to him and finds his or her own ways of achieving happiness. But clearly it is one of the main goals on lives of almost everybody.

Let is begin with the reasons for this. On the one hand, British and American film industries are more popular because of the financial support, which the government gives them. As we can see if film has the best actors and good equipment, it means that film has a good financial support. For example, if film industries want to see popular actors playing in their films, actors should have a good salary for this job. Moreover, if they want to have a good camera or place, where the film will be, they also should have a money to rent it.
On the other hand, many people all over the world like superheroes or stories, which are more closely for their interests or unreal lifes. People want to watch movies, where they can take place, where they can be every character they want. It is obviously, that if we want to forget about our problems, we can go to the cinema and watch the movie about Spider-man or X-men. Watching these films we can go away from the real life. So, film industries, which have a good financial support have a chance to help us to solve our problems, whereas local film industries cannot. They can only tell us stories, which are closely to our real lifes.
To sum up, I want to say that it is important to film industries have a good finances to produce their films. I claim that government should give more money to local film industries, if they really want to have their own popular film makers and actors. But they should be sure that films, which they produce, will have a success.",70,2,1

Let's us discuss about this problem. 


On the one hand there are people who think that the government should restrict artists, because they change the way of thinking not in good way. For example, museums and galleryes open their's door for teenagers and if young generation see this strange pictures, they can loose interest for other traditional art. Moreover, there are many awful film which people can see switch on the TV. People just waste their time because they can't see healthful TV programmes. Some people say that more and more traditional museums are closed because for people it becomes uninterst and unpopular.


But there are people who think that artists help us to know more about modern art and our culture. For example, there are many modern art galleries in the world where you can see beautiful pictures, watching amazing film and hearing unforgetable music which can open your eyes for new feeling. Moreover, creative artists can help you developing your skills and knowledge. It is also important to find something knew for yourself. Most of creative artists are younger people and the government should help them to improve their way of feelings and thinking which is really important.


In conclusion, I think that government should help creative artists improve their knowledge and skills because it can be interesting not only for young deneration but and older people too.

Governments establish different policies to increase health level. There are a lot of world organizations that try to reduce mostly dangerous diseases. People argue in what way we should increase our health. Someone claims for sport, others think that it is not the best way.
In my opinion, sport facilities can help us to improve our health level. I believe that people who involved in sport live longer and healthier. Nowadays we have a lot sport disciplines and people can choose what they according to their opinions and evryone have chances to start because there a lot sport sections all over the world. But you are not allowed to be professional sportsman. As evryone know health of real sportsmen is not good enough when they retaire because of a lot of injures.
What is more, I can not refuse ideas that not only sport facilities can improve public health. I believe that governments should play main role in increasing people`s health. That is why they should provide different policies and programms for people, also support finansialy local hospitals, schools and universties.  As I can remember, our region government support all schools in region to provide medical analisis and tests for all puipls several times in year. Nowaday different countries try to help each other, because problem of low level of public health is the most important.

To begin with, it is fair to mention that according to some recent statistics the vast majority of adults and teenagers spend long hours watching football, tennis, swimming or other sport events instead of perfoming their duties which include far more complicated tasks than lying on the sofa. Furthermore, it is not a secret that our young generation is a truly lazy one, so up-to-date children would rather watch sport games on Tv than being engaged themselves.
On the other hand, i can not but agree that for those who contemplate a career in sport live sports events can help to acquire new knowledge and improve some weak points.
Besides, it should be mentioned that a lot of families get united when sitting together in front of a Tv and having heated debates on a particular sports topic. In addtion, i want to admit that national sports ocassions translated by means of Tv have an objective to trigger some patriotic feelings.
In conclusion, it must be emphasized that despite some negative effects watching sport games can provide people with, it can not be attributed to any kind of senseless activities.",70,2,1

According to the statistics, nowadays 30-35% of family’s income is spent on education of children.

Some people can argue, because the impact of the strongest drugs is not study well, therefore the athletes can change their health for the rest of the life.

Moreover, it the professional athletes did not use illegal drugs, the sport would not be so interesting. The sportsmens overcome human limits only by using drugs.
On the other hand, when the athletes take steroids, they show a bad example for the young generation. Teenagers start thinking they will not achieve the goals in the professional sport without drugs. It leads them to not work hard, but use the drugs to become ordinary athletes. For these reasons sportsmens using the drugs should be banned for the rest of the life.

Some of them are passion, others are active. However, whether have the characteristics we have from our birth more influence on our personality than experiences that we get in our life? I am deeply convinced, that it is not so. This essay is meant to view arguments for experience is more prominent than the characteristics we are born with.
First of all, any abilities must be developed. It is difficult to imagine, that all talented people were born with their great abilities in doing something. For instance, Mozart who was a musician and composed amazing music, trained for hours every day with his farther. He did not stop his study and it helps him to achieve great results in music.
Secondly, only experience that people get in their life help to realize their mistakes and make a character stronger. So, some people can be born in happiness and their childhood is wonderful and careless, however after the death of someone they must face reality and understand how to live. This example shows, that any experience is much important and it influences on our personality more than the characteristics we were born.
To draw the conclusion, I would like to say, that the answer to the question could be different. Nevertheless, only experience can change a person and makes him better. At the same time, people who cope with problems, have a stronger character.

This essay will analyse the principal problem of using gadjets everywhere in our life and offer a solution to this issue.
A number of key issues arise from the statement. One of the most striking feature of this problem is that due to modern technologies our life became conviniet: many people cannot reject these items even if gadjet are harmful because as without them they will spend a lot of time for their duties, for a example. The second aspect of this problem is that many young people are addicted to modern technologies: Iphones, Ipads, Macbook, since they have social networks there. Where they can communicate with their friends. Teenagers do not care that using a lot of them caused a lot of problems with eyes.
What is needed to improve the situation with widespread using of gadjets is definite action should be encouraged and promoted by means of avoiding them. Young people can spent more time with treir parents or friends, to read books, to develop their different skills instead of using modern technologies. What is more, there can be different limits of using.
From this facts, one may cloced that it is very hard to avoid it. since the life is go on. And the impact of them is big.

This suggestion has both advantages and disadvantages and I would like to mention all of them.
The benefits of this system are pretty obvious. Every person will get some money, which can also help in difficult situation. There are some people who are not in the category of old people or invalids, but they still can have problems with finances. Also every person in the country has a right to get some money from selling and reproducing the nation goods of their country. For example, many people in Russia are not satisfied, that they don’t get anything from our natural goods, from selling gas, oil, gold and other things to other countries.
However, this idea also has some disadvantages. Giving money from governmental budget to every citizen can be dangerous for economy of the country. It can lead to the growth of costs for different products, crisis and laziness of the population. It can take many years to stabilize the economic situation. Also, this system can lead to deficit of the governmental budget and decline of money given to some governmental organizations, like schools, hospitals and others.

That is why its improving is reguarded as a chief goal of every country and every government. The increasing of sport facilities is one of the methods to do this. Yet, some other people think that the range of measures is wider and sport development is not enough to achieve the goal. So, let us think it over.


First of all, the development of sport can encourage teenagers to refuse their bad habbits like drinking alcohol and smoking and to show them a better way of their personal development. This somewhat determines the improving of public health in the future, when all of these young people will grow up. More than that, growing amount of sport facilities can be a remedy to avoid some other kind of addiction – computer addiction, which is commonly believed to be a serious problem among teenagers in our contemporary world of modern technologies.


On the other hand, it should be mentioned that physical activities can not ensure the sharp improving of public health, because there are people suffering from different deseases. And this problem could be solved by various social projects in order to help such people with money for their treatment, for instance. Undoubtly, this aspect of public health improving is on the shoulders of governments.


To conclude, I absolutely agree with the statement that sport facilities are essential for health of population as a whole. Yet, there are some other effective measures that may alter the outcome. Improving of health care is the challenge that governments must face.

I believe that all humans should have the same rights without an exception of university subjects.
To my mind, there is no faculty where women can't study at all, but I pretend that both male and female must have the similar chances to pass the exams and go to the university. This system works in Russia. Teenagers pass their exams and university compare their results independently of the sex of person.
The system when there are strictly half of men and half of women on each subject can't be honest because of the proportion. For example, in Sweden there are 60% girls and 40% boys. Using this system boys have more complicated competition than girls.
The second argument against equal number is historical examples. Men were more successful than women in all spheres for all the countries. It is uninversale process: there are some exceptions and examples such as Nefertiti, Tatcher of Hewston, but in general men are more talented chairmen, doctors, cookers, presidents and sportmen. So, when there is an equal number of male and female students some men, who completed only with the boys , won't have an education even he is stronger in some sphere than the girl.
I suppose that similar rights is one of the busical rules of modern world, but there is no chance to realize system of equal male and female students only because it is dishonest.

There are several reasons for this situation and I'll discuss some of them in my essay.
First of all, someone's decision to watch a film or not is usually based on their expectations of the film's quality. For example, if a person wants to watch a science fiction or fantastic film, he or she wants to see there special effects of high quality, and it is reasonable to think that they would be much better in a Holliwood film with a big budget.
Secondly, people's desire to watch some film often depends on its publicity. Local film companies often do not have enough money to widely advertise their product, so public may not even be informed well enough about the film and would prefer to spend money on watching a Holliwood blockbuster with famous actors instead of some independent film.
Some people believe that governments should invest money in local film companies in order to change this situation. I do not agree with this point of view. In my opinion, film production does not differ from any other commercial industry. Therefore, the ability to find investors is a part of this business. In addition, there is a danger that government would invest only in the films with 'proper' plots, which means that they will control directors' freedom of speech.
To sum up, there are many reasons for people to choose foreign films and not local ones. While some people argue that it is a worrying trend which must be changed through governments policy, it is actually a normal situation in modern world of commerce.",70,2,0

Some may say that sport organisations should permanantly ban such athletes without any chance for professional recovery. There is a different point of view: athletes can preceve in the career, but with a short period of detention. This topic is highly arguable in the situation caused by some allegitable drug scandals in recent years.
From one perspective, there should only be a temperary ban from competing. It is somehow a fair decition albait being, some may say, very soft. The allys of that point of view suggest that in situation where an great athlete once cheating or cheating for a first time get susspention for the rest of their lives is terribly wrong. It can ruin not only his professional life, but also cause some difficult mental-health problems. Another point is the problem of false acusations and verdicts based of corruption and caused by the will to professionally ""kill"" strong opponents of your athlete.
On the other hand, as they say, if you cheat once, you will cheat again. Some sports team managers concentrate their main resourses not on the training but on the finding a new ways to cheat for the whole team. Such strict and permanent consicuences may be the solution to the problem of ""team-cheating"". Futhemore, there is an ethical side to this story: it can be seen as unfair toward other athletes, who have never cheated in their entire lives. Given the option not only to maintain your professional status and not taking away all the awards from the cheater may cause a chock or at least a doubt in hearts of other athletes.
Both points of view have the strengths and weaknessess. The main disadvantage of first one is the lack of fairness towards not guilty athletes. Second one does not provide a clear explanation for the problem of cases, where athlete was caught only once and it was, for instance, a decade ago.
Overall, there is no sutesfing out come for these two groups. In my opinion, it is not fair to ban people for life for cheating, but it is neccecary to maintain a strong limitation policy for caught individuals. Hence this question remains without an answer, but there are new ways for answering it.

Governments of many countries plan some certain laws associated with the reduction of journeys and trips by planes for work and activities because many of air travel do not need.
To my mind, governments in the whole world should correct and regulate these moving because aircrafts produce the biggest amount of gas waste and CO2. According to the statistics, plains are defined as a transport, which has the hugest indexes of refusing waste per 1 metre in cube in the air. The total number of aircrufts in the world equal almost 10000 and they fly every day without a break for last 50 years polluting the air.
More over, people really do not need to have so many travels by plane. According to the data of Aeroflot company, more than 50 percent of total flights have unnecessary purposes. If each man fly even once a week, during the year one flight will turn into thousands of flights, which will injure our environment and air in our case.
However, if government reduct the number of air flight, this procedure will have a negative aspect on the private economy sector of all countries. Many air companies will have defaults because of the low number of flights. Also it will influence in governments' sector because air companies will not pay the certain taxes.
To draw the conclusion, it is important to say that air travels are really one of the most actual problems in aspect associated with global warming and air pollution. Thus, the world should create some methods of struggling with this phenomennon except the method of air travels' reduction.

First of all, these long hours people spend in front of their computer screens might affect their eyes badly. This problem is extremely popular among both grown-ups and children. The second problem modern technologies may cause is an addiction.

Moreover, it is the safetiest transport. Another kind of transport, for example cars, are much more dangerous than airplanes.

Without these money, this companiy can’t make a quality new products. A good example is a “Metro Golden Mayer” which loss more than 3,5 billions dollars from 2008 year. The biggest project of company films about agent 007 James Bond hasn’t enough money for making them, and new films of this franshise made only once in 6-7 years versus once in 2-3 years in 1990-08.
On the other hand a lot of people think that opportunity of free watching gaming or listening it a good chance not only for consumers but and for actors, artist and companyes. Yes, of course they are missing their money, but they are get fame and respect from million people which can’t spend 20-30 $ on film or 50-60$ for game. What is more, many people which download torren files and get pleasure from them will buy not only licensed driver this product but and next product of this firm. For example “Witcher 3” from “CD-Project” had the biggest sellers after 2 month of release, maybe it will effect of “white pirates” which buy this game after one-two month of gaming on pirate copies.
In conclusion I want say that this problem is very difficult for once meaning. I hope that political of cost makeup will more and more loyal and all people will have opportunity use only licensed product on official copies and this solution will good for both hand of this discussion.

However, some people think that these internet sites need for entertaining. So, who is right? My essay will look both at two these points of view. Firstly, it is believed that we should use Facebook and Vkontakte for sharing information. It is very convenient for many reasons. Students can share their thoughts about lectures, ask for home tasks, discuss their subjects, universities and so on. Moreover, people who do not see each other for a long time can tell each other about their location. The most interesting periods of their lives and discuss their future meeting. Besides, Facebook and Vkontakte are good for business people because they can discuss some serious questions which can be solved by the internet. So they do not have to spent their time on meeting. A lot of universities have their own official pages on Facebook, so students from different countries can find the information. They need about entering this university. There is another point of view that the main reason why we use Facebook and Vkontakte is our desire to entertain. With the help of these two sites we can learn a lot about new films, we can watch them, listen on-line books and so on. People find their favourite songs in Vkontakte, watch clips and comment them. Also there are a lot of funny games: from how to dress the princess to games with cars. Facebook and Vkontakte are full of social tasks which you can write when you are bored. In the conclusion, it must be said that people use Facebook and Vkontakte for different purposes. Some prefer find and read articles about science, environment, social problems, but others use them just for watching films, video and listening music. In my opinion, the main purpose of Facebook and Vkontakte is haring information and knowledge. These sites are full of interesting facts and articles from, which you can learn a lot.

And it causes to spending time just sitting. Modern human doesn’t had much physical activities to reduce his problems and it causes to problems with human’s health.

Some of modern gadgets can pollut the air or not ecofriendly at all. This problem important for our health, too. 

This problem can reduce for a couple solutions. Firstly, technology must be coming eco friendly. We already can see what is going on with car technology. Electric eco-friendly cars are growing up their popularity. Secondly, it needs to motivate people to do some phisical activities. In many Asian countries you can see a lot of people who wake up on the the early morning and go for a run or othe exercises. This factor can cause to more strong health of modern human.

There is no simple answer on such difficult question. As it widely known the most of the crimes are made by those who already made them. Potentially people who are already in prison have more chances to make a crime so it could be a good idea to take them longer in prison but after all they still should be exit. The longer sentences can made prisoner more angry. What is the difference in prison between 10 years and 15 years? The world around us changes and the longer prison sentences means the harder returning to a normal life in society it creates big risks for those who only exit the prison after a long times. The main aim of the prison is to punish and improve the people, but does it actually improve people? For example in some Scandinavian countries prisoners have ability to reduse their time in prison by reading some books and then passing a tests about knowledge of this books. I think such things can help more than longer prison sentences. The longer prisoners are in prison the more it costs for the government. In fact those who does not make any crime should pay taxes for prisoners time in prison. It is possible to give them some work or social work at which they will earn money to reduce costs for the government. Overall, I think there a lot of better ways to improve people and help them to return to a normal life than give the, longer prison sentences.

Some people think that creative artists should be given the ability to express their own opinion in whichever way they wish, so the government must not control this process. However, another part of society may think that the creative artists shouldn't express their ideas in the way they wish and the government should restrict this.
In my opinion, creative artists should always be given the freedom of expression their own opinion and should not afraid of government restrictions. First of all, it will be a good example for all people to express their own opinion and the pluralism of opinions and ideas will lead to real democratic state. Secondly, creative artists can create a rich culture with different types of buildings, pictures and films which will be able to please all members of the society. Thirdly, the pluralism of ideas of creative artists can be valuable for creating effective infrastructure and economy.
In the other hand, the freedom of expression your own ideas has its drowbacks. Firstly, lot's of ideas can lead to misunderstanding in society and, consicuantly, to disunity in public opinion (remember the case of Pussy Riots, for example). Moreover, creative artists can give some wrong ideas to the society, which can have bad impacts (for example, the idea of smoking has bad impacts of population's health).
In conclusion, the issue of expression's freedom is very contraversive. As I have said before, it will be better if government will give the creative artists the ability to tell about their ideas without any fear of punishment. I suppose, it will make our culture richer.

But is the decrease of air transport a good idea or not? Let’s consider.
Let’s start with the point of view, that the governments should ignore this situation and the amount of flights remains steady. There are a lot of advantages.
Firstly, people can travel by plane as often as they want. Secondly, the price for tickets stays the same.
As for disadvantages, the global warming and air pollution because of the air transport hurmes our planet.
Now let’s consider the opinion, that the governments should reduce the amount of flights. This situation has its advantages: air transport will pollute the atmosphere less, and there will be less air accidents.
But this situation has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, the price for tickets to planes will rise quickly. Only rich people will fly.
Secondly, the majority of population will use other kinds of pub transport, for example, trains, cars, ships. So, we can’t say, that these types of transport hurms our environment less, than planes.
Thirdly, the tourism will stop to develop, because of lack of planes. Te fact, that the majority of people prefer to travel abroad for many thousands km.
In addition si the same problems will take place in business.
To sum it up, it is no need for governments to decline the amount of air travel, because firstly, air transport is the safest transport; secondly, without air transport our world stops develop.

That could be argued that a gap year is a good possibility for young people to become mature and make a right decission about their educational program for the future. According  to some experts, teenagers are so young to decide which profession is the great for them . That free year they could spent on different jobs and find some advantages and disadvantages of these professions. Therefore, a person could learn dome skills for higher education. While students are not clearly understand their subjects at university, others try to train their mind for that. Also, a gap year, which was spent to travelling, help to relax and explore the world and because of this, a person could make friends with people from other contries and become more tolerant for different cultures.
There are some reasons against idea of taking a free year between high and higher edication. Firstly, young people could become lazy, thereby they will not want to start university studies or find a job at all. Altough a man know that this year he must waste to learn some helpful life and educational skills, he could spend that sitting at home and doing nothing. Besides, a young person could became less clear-mind than people who have started the higher education after high school without delay. Without practice young people could lose their educational skills.

It is mostly connected with the increasing importance of the Internet for people. In my opinion, punishing people for doing such crimes should be cancelled, because of the context of new market, which changes under the pressure of the Internet.
First of all, it is important to understand that you cannot control all of the information in the web networks. There are many people, who copy and share content of electronic information illegally, but catching and punishing all of them will be really expensive. The cost of this may be probably higher than the loss of money from the process of “pirating”.
Secondly, modern market moves in the direction of micro transactions, instead of simple selling the product. You can get more money from consumer, who has free access to some fragments of your film, but pays for the other fragments. However, this strategy can also be violated by pirates, because they can make copies of expensive fragments. Besides, statistics shows that this method of fighting with pirates is more effective than punishing them.
Last but not least, punishing pirates leads to the violation of the right for the freedom in the Internet. By monitoring and controlling cases of illegal copying of the information, companies will interrupt private life of people and their opportunity to be free in the web.

However, others claim that the main purpose of them is entertaining people. In this essay, I am going to discuss both sides and explain my opinion. To begin with, social networks such of Facebook or Vkontakte gives one a lot of opportunities for studying and learning something new. For example, it is very common to learn languages or such websites. Moreover,  a person can easily share his or her knowledge through such pages and to get followers. It is very usefull as the one who shares information  will become more confident and those, who read information, will get new knowledge which can be essential for them in not to distant future. However, not everyone agrees with that point view. Many people are sure that main target of Vkontakte and Facebook is entertaining and interesting. They say that target customers of such websites are teenagers and they do not want to share information and study in their freetime. For instance, most young replaced Facebook and Vkontakte with Instagram, where photos and videos are uploaded without any extra information. To conclude, absolute entertaining is very important for interviewing people, but if can not attract for a long time. Everyone needs to learn something new and to develop himself or herself. In my opinion, entertaing without learning does not give anything to people, however gaining new information not only makes people more but it is also fun.

To begin with, it clearly can be seen that a big proportion in both ways of transportation consists of manufactured goods. Thus, they take about 25% in rail transport and 28% in road transport. However, there are some differences between these ways. Firstly, the percentage of metals which is transported by rail is much higher than the same metal transported by road with 35% and 11% respectively. In contrast, food products take about 30% in road transport and just 11% in rail one. 

As for other goods, they take approximately the same proportion, about 12-16 each. However, noticable fact is  that machinery goods transported by road take only 2%, that is the lowest number among all. 

To conclude it all, the most obvious fact is that metal goods are on the first position in the rail transport, while food products take the first place in the road transportation.

In my opinion, air travel is unceparatable part of modern people’s life. First of all, every transports have a harmful effects on environment due to this fact people cant avoid all ways of travelling. What is more, there are a lot of people who work in foreign countries and air travel is only way to reache their workplace. Consequently, it will be very difficult to reduce the amount of air travel for business. Secondly, scientist try to creat some new substance which will dicrease harmful effect, such as environmental freandly oil or gas. Finally, there are a lot of laws which regulate this sphere, for example, air code but in practice laws do not create contribution payments system. On the other hand, some people claim that a lot of air travel is unnecessary. They say that people should use transport which work on solar power. Besides, they think that law system which regulate air travelling is very weak, due to this fact government should creat new framework. I strongly disagree with this view, because only air transport allows to travel on a long distances. Air travel are more comfortable and conveniant than cars or trains. Despite other people’s opinion, I still believe that air travel has not proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming.

So the number of air travels should decrease. First opportunity to reduce the next generation, which can transport an enormous amount of people and use new type on soil for there engine. This investment of these types of plane will be very expensive but will help to reduce amount of flights and will be more safety for environment, because they will be able to do one flight indeed five of sive flights by old planes. The second way to decrease a number of unnecessary air travels is to ban small private airlines and private planes, if only the last are not governmental planes for important international visits. If there are fewer amount of private airlines, that government will be able to develop common air travels companies, to watch for the technical condition of the plane and the convenience of the passengers. So this decision will help not only to reduce the amount of flights of private planes but to increase the quality of air travel for passengers and for the technical condition of planes, which belong to government airline and have all necessary technical checking results.

People’s choice is limitless for this reason, and it is very difficult for them sometimes to choose an appropriate and suitable way to happiness, and this, by turn, can cause mistakes.
Secondly, every person is an individual with his or her own feelings, emotions, knowledge, experience, interests, etc. All these charracteristics in summ form his or her opinion about happiness and what is needed to take it.
Therefore it’s hard to give a definition to your personal happiness taking into account other views.
Thirdly, although it is a controversial point, I tend to think that without finally understanding that you are happy, you can’t say what is happiness for you.
Nevertheless, to percieve yourself as a happy person, you should have a goal you strongly want to succeed, because without it it not possible to continue real life. Moreover, you ought to never give up dealing with difficulties and obstacles to go on finding your happiness.
In conclusion, people’s happiness is an issue under discussion. Its variety of definitions is as wide as the amount of people on the Earth, and often give it prior importance in our lives.

This topic has as benefits as drawbacks. In this essay both sides of this problem will be examined carefully. First of all, these international companies force the economy of their country while relocating their business to it. It helps not only to solve the problem of unemployment but also amends country and encourages it for development and modernization. Some may argue that this does not give  chance for local companies to grow and become famous. However, I believe that international companies help local ones and maintain them because they are able to share their skills in businesses. Furthermore, these tranformations are useful and convenient for companies due to the fact that labour force if usually cheaper in poor countries. This is an excellent way to save money. For example, during the economical crisis it is possible not to close your business in rich and developed country, but just relocate it to poorer one. From the other hand, spendings for rebuilding and rerunning the business could be higher. In my view, this spendings are smaller than a demolishment of the business. Nevertheless, it is often clainmed that employees from poor countries are being discriminated and have awful conditions at work because nobody could present their interests and fight for their rules. I would say that this is a problem at all companies which employ cheep labour force. But from my point of view, international companies would never afford themselves to discrimate workers because they are often well-known and this aspect shade their reputation. All in all, I think that relocating the business to poor countries and employing workers form that place has more advantages than disadvantages. This maintain the economy and solve the problem of unemployment poor country. Moreover, it is beneficial for international businesses it is developing, spreading and saving money via this way.

Some of the subjects are more likely to be taken by male students, and others are interesting for female students. So, there is an inequality between the number of them.
On the one hand, universities can solve this problem by accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Firstly, there would be an opportunity for all students to study the subject as a person must be openminded and develop every side of his or her personality. Secondly, social life can be more interesting and different with a number of different kinds of students.
On the other hand, there can be a problem when some of students are not keen on this or that subject. They all have own hobbies and interests, so there would be more logical to allow students to visit lessons they are fond of. Moreover, uniwersity is the place where students prepare to be professionals, so it means that there must be a choice what subject to take, no matter equal numbers of male and female students are or not.
In conclusion, I want to say that it doesn't really matter how many male or female students learn every subject. They have to make their own right choices, in case to express themselves or their ideas, especially if they are sure about their future career. So, even if only girls or only boys learn the subject, they should be enjoying the lessons.

Firstly, the most important factor is a clear project of what he she tends to name ""hapiness "". If the person doesn't have any model of this, he / she will never achieve it because ndeody could reach a goal if the sense of the goal is misunderstood. For example if one woman wants to have a high salary she should write somewhere a certain sum of money she is looking forward - for some people 10$ could also be a great sum and they work round-the-clock to earn them while others are sure that 1000$ is worth of nothing.
Secondly, people should work hard to achieve the goal because if the person does nothing he / she will receive also nothing. People should develop themselves and go further to create the future. The permanent actions and development may give the person a dream on a purpose that could make him /her happy future life .
Thirdly, people should never give in because there could be a number of failures before the only success. The main thing is not to lose the possibility but to use it properly.
To sum up, I'm deeply convinced that happiness is an achieveable goal but people should work hard and not give up this idea, while being on the way to this dream.

On the one side, Facebook and Vkontakte are really usefull for educational process. It means that people are able to communicate fluently with other students through these sites. For example, if a group of students needs to do any project, they may discuss it and do it online in group charts using Vkontakte or Facebook. Moreover, there are a huge amount of virtual groups which allocate people who are interested in a particular subject so they may discuss and share relative topics in such online groups based in different social media. On the other side, some people argue that social networking sites are for relaxing as they have wide range of functions for that. For instance, users can download films. Listen music and so on. Besides, someone considers that only university rooms are for studying. It means that student should do any home tasks in groups only in university communicating directly with each others because online charts may lead to discussing extra topics which are not related to the task. All in all, I consider that social networking sites are primary for sharing with your friends. However, this sharing may include both sharing something what you know and would like to discuss with your friends just for fun and entertainment and also sharing some serious interesting information with society of online groups.

There are 5 levels: skilled vocational diploma, undergraduate diploma, Bachelor's degree, postgraduate diploma and master's degree. This chart shows us that the persentage of male who choose skilled vocational diploma is very high (90%). In undergraduate diploma we can see the other situation. 70% females and only 30% studied on this level.
Therefore we can make conclusion that only undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's degree had more females, than males. The other levels get more males than females. For example: 70% males and only 30% females got postgraduate diploma. The third situation we can see on Bachelor's degree, because the quantity of males and females was the same (55 and 45 percent).

There is an opinion, that we do not need air travel because of the fact that it pollutes our environment, and that is why the government has to minimize the amount of travels by flights by making laws. However, others believe that the air transport is vital for travelling and doing business. Let us outline both sides on this statement.
On the other hand, using flights as a way of transportation can be harmful for people’s health: different gases, oil pollute the atmosphere and lead to negative consequences such as natural disasters, global warming and may also damage the whole environment. By the way, it may cause different diseases which can affect people’s well-being.
So, government should have efforts to reduce using air travel by introducing lows.
Nevertheless, not all people agree with this position. Despite the fact, that flights damage people and our planet, they have some advantages. Firstly, they are the fastest way of travelling on the distant corners of the world, saving a lot of time on commuting. Besides, withe the use of flights it is more convinient and efficient to run business or meet with business partners abroad and make your company international.
In conclusion, it seems clear that the government doesn’t have to reduce the number of travel by flight at all, because it is quite useful and convinient type of transport. However, it is necessary to make airline more ecological and less harmful for the health and the environment, I am sure, that it will be possible, if nobody will be indifferent to this problem.

But what should be done to reach this effect? Some people think that the solution of this problem is to give very long prison sentences. Others suggest another ideas. What alternatives should be chosen? For my opinion, the best way to stop crime is killing all catched criminals. First of all, if a person successfully commited a crime, he or she can repeat it. But after death, there is no chance to do it. As for my country, prisons are very uncomfortable so after them people become cruel and evil; they can easily, behave in an appropriate way. If the period they spend in prison became longer, this effect will be only more destructive. The other reason is that not enough harmful punishment make people not to be afraid of being catched, so these can easily risk. For example, Andreas Breyvic killed lots of people and got a room in a “luxury hotel” with plenty of food and access to the Internet. Many poor people would like to be on his place, because they do not have goods. The criminals (first of all, murders!) must be harshly punished. That should be done not for them, but for other people who will become too frightened to do something illegal. Another argument us that keeping a person in prison costs a lot. These money can be used more effectively; for instance, for helping to poor, on free education and medicine. The people who have never done any crime pay the taxes and give these money to the who did – not a very fair system, isn’t it? To conclude, I think that prisons are a mistake practice. The criminals must be murdered, as it partly done in some great countries , such as USA and China.

In some countries such an opportunity is highly welcomed, many advantages are thought to be found, from some people's point of view. As I see it, the argument is flawed.
It is believed that a gap-year is a chance for students to think once again what career to choose. Especially helpful would be a working experience before applying to a university, so youngsters can see what they are good at and what preferences they have. Moreover the become more mature while working and more prepared for university life. Apart from this, teenagers can travel for a year, see the world, practice their communicative skills and obviously, relax before a hard year in a university and a beginning of their new adult life. An experience of having a gap-year, is popular in the USA. 
However, I doubt theese ideas to be as reasonable as they tend to be. Firstly, if a person decides to work before applying to a university they should be aware of losing interest in having further education for the reasons of being involved in their career plans. Secondly, they may lose many of their skills, an ability to learn. As for the travelling, if students choose to take this opportunity, they have a risk to drop an idea of a higher education for the reasons of seeming boring comparing to travelling. Also, such a trip will cost much, many students can't even afford this luxerious experience. 
In conclusion, the disadvantages of having a gap-year for students far outweigh the advantages for the reasons mentioned above.

From one hand it is better for economics inside the country to produce food and products only for their population, because it is support small businesses in that area and will improve them that in the future country could rise the whole economy.

But from another hand some countries experts in one tipe of products and they sell this products to another country to buy different types of food. It call co-supporting (to help each others and they will help you). Because some countries cannot produce some food types because of climat or type of the ground and etc. Countries should cooperate with each other to support the stable economy. 

Furthermore it might help with economic inside the country to do less import and support their own produce of the food. I do not agree with this part of the staytment, because sometimes country just can not produce fresh food for all population and it gives more import from another country to support them.

In my opinion, countries should improve their economic inside by producing more food for themselves. I disagree that countries should aim to import as little as possible, because sometimes they can do this because of the climate or another difficulties. Countries should support each others.

Also, people will have more activities in their lives, because today we just go to work or study and back. Eventually, doing different exersizes, we will have more muscles and our bones will be broken less.
On the other hand, only increasing gyms and other sports facilities will not help society to make public helth better. To begin with, very few people will use new sports classes or something else. We are too busy to have enough time and spend it on sport. Moreover, today people have a lot of inborn illnesses, so sport cannot help them.

First of all, we should not forget that every human being has his own dreams of who he is going to become. It is clear that males and females sometimes have a different preferences- males are good at engeneering, physics and subjects like this and females do well in philology, teaching and so on.

Buying the original discs and alboms in iTunes is the perfect way to thank your favourite artist. They spend a lot of time and emotions to cheer you up with music, to provoke something in you.  Isn’t it a reason for punishing people downloading files on the Internet for free? I guess it is, because it makes the work of an artist worthless.

Moreover, the police sometimes is not that reliable as we really want it to be. So, how can we reduce the amount of crimes?
Some people claim that giving longer prison sentences will be helpfull.In my opinion, it does not. However, if a person would be in prison for a longer period, he/she always had a chance to do the same crime again when he revealed. So, these people are concerned that being in prison helps people not to do crimes again.I do not really think so. For instance, there are a lot of junkies in hip-hop culture that were in prison and after their revealing begin to do it even more often, sometimes these drug dealers are making their buisness even in prison.

On the other hand, there are some people who think in other way. They believe that there are alternative ways of dicreesing crimes in our society. To my mind, these people are right.
What can we do with these prisoners. Of course, there are always been social works and other ways to make these people obey the law. Personally I belive that to reduce crimes we need to manage prisoners with some interesting to them things. For example, one of the most famous rappers in the USA called Pusha T was a cocain dealer in his youth, but after being included in hip-hop culture he stopped all of his buisness and began to motivate young people not to bound into drug industry.

Talking about railway systems which were built in 1900 in Paris, I can say that the route length is a half from London's metro.

It can be deduced from the charts that many types of goods were transported by rail as successfully as by roads in 2008.
Namely, the amount of chemicals delivered by trains was only 5% lower than one by trucks: 11% and 16% respectively. Similarly, 25% of manifactured goods were transported with the help of trains and 28% - by road.
But the differences also exist. For example, six-time more machinery was transported by rail: it was 12% when only 2% are delivered by road.
Trains were also more preferable for transporting metals: approximately three-time more metals were transported by them - 35%, when only 11% were moved with the help of trucks.In contrast, three-time more food products were transported by roads then by trains: 30% and 11% respectively. Speaking about non-metalic minerals,it can also be noticed, that they were moved more often with the help of trucks than with the help of trains.

It is considered that authorities have to prohibit using such way of changing a location by special laws, especially, if flights for fun or for not very vital work. I do believe that this idea is not as effective as other variants like developing new technologies for planes. First and foremost, the globalisation is coming and the world will not be running as it is now without opportunities that people are given because of fast flights. Businessmen need to have such sort of transport to meet with the international partners and rule their companies that can be located in different countries. Consequently, without flourishing economic area that is provided by that enterpreneurs and also air companies the standards of life and likely to decrease dramatically because people will loose their jobs, some goods in some regions will not be available and so on. Moreover, citizens can rebel because little of them will encourage such policy without tourism and prospects for development in business. Having said that, governments should protect the environment and stop the air pollution. Global warming and other disasters influence people noticebly. So that authorities have to provide special rules that prohibit machines which dangerous wastes are over norms and invest in researches in this sphere of science. All in all, inspite the fact that global warming and air pollution affects human beings negatively. I am totally sure that the efficiency of laws which reduce the amount of business and leisure flights will not be as high as it is necessary to protect the environment.

I completely disagree with this point of view on this global problem. Firstly, new albums of famous musician groups could cost a lot of money for the first time after the release it to the market. So, not all people could allow to buy it. So, the only way to get it is to download through the Internet.
Secondly, because of some reasons you are not able to find your favorite musician disc or film in the market, but you can find this material in the specific sites, like Torrents. So, you have an opportunity to spend less time in operations of getting necessary product. 
From my experience, I used sites with illegal pirate copies by approximately four or five years and could find and download a lot of films, music and video games for free. And there are few million people, that doing the same things every day even despite the fact, that these pirate sites had been closen by the government.
Thirdly, it is more convinient to download files on the PC and not to collect a lot of unnecessary disces in your room.
So, the government should legalize this type of copying and sharing musician and filmography products, because it is more available for mostly all citizens of the country. And the government mustn’t punish them because of the fact that, they don’t buy original discs. For this reason, government should create a few special sites and take its under their control.
To summarize, people, who use these types of sites should be punished only if the government legalize these sites. So, after that all persons could get a legal access to these products. If government doesn’t do such things, the sites should be clothed and all the creators of the sites should be punished. But, for my opinion, it would be efficient for all citizens in the county, if the pirate sites would be allowed for them.

Producers and musicians lose their money because their masterpieces are being stolen. It is a serious crime to illegally copy music and films and publish them on the Internet. Not only pirates should be punished, but also people who use these copies. I agree with this opinion and I will give my reasons why.

Firstly, every work should be paid. Producers, musicians spend a lot of money to make a product. It is just unfair when someone uses it for free. people should understand that films and music are the same goods as clothes, cars, houses. When you watch a film you must pay for entertainment. Morover, it can be hardly imagined how producers and musicians feel when their masterpieces become just pirate copies.

Secondly, it is always a pleasure to watch films and listen to the music in a good quality. When we buy something we can have unrestricted access to that. If we buy an album, we will listen to it for years. Furthermore, there won’t be any extra noise or bad quality songs.

Thirdly, we help producers and musicians to make their products better with buying music and films. They start trying do their work better for the audience.

However, there is an opposing opinion. Some Internet users think that unrestricted access to films and music make our life easier. We can get what we want in a minute. That is the typical hydonists’ point of view. But I think we should care not about only ourselves. You should give something for take.

To conclude, I do believe that making pirate copies an using the, is a real crime. People who use illegal copies of films and music should be punished. They need to understand that every work should be paid. Remembering this pivotal principe will make either producers and musicians’ or Internet users’ lives easier.

Nowadays they are widely used by millions of people all over the world. Some people believe that the main aim of social network is information, while others think they are the means of entertainment. In my essay I will consider both points of view and present my own opinion. It’s common knowledge that social networks are very functional, which makes them a great platform for sharing any kind of information and texts, audios, images and videos. People can interact using private messages, create blogs or post something on their pages. Moreover, the speed of information spreading on the Internet is the greatest. All these allows you to use social media such as Facebook or Vkontakte for knowledge and experience exchange. However, these platforms cannot be considered fully safe, as most of the information thee is easily accessible by other unfamiliar people. It is known, for instance, that violence, child abuse and proud are spread in social nets. Turning to the other side of argument, Facebook or Vkontakte offer a wide range of entertaining facilities to its users due to the fact that they have the already mentioned functions of media sharing. That is, these social media have become so popular among people of all ages because with its help it is possible to get access to gygabits of music or videos, watch photos taken in all parts of our planet or read some notes of a person discussing the subject you are interested in. Despite these features, there is a growing concern about the addiction caused by social networks, which is especially topical for the parents or teenagers. Youngsters spending hours surfing in the internet may miss school, escape from reality and become social outcasts. All the things considered, both points of view have their reasons to exist. Social media can be used either for interaction and information exchange, or for entertaining but both have its tourists. As for as I own concerned, a person should strike the right balance between communication and having fun on the internet and take advantage of all of these functions.

Although there are drawbacks to such actions, I would argue that these are outweighed by the benefits. (hdsfvu)

The main disadvantage of this tendency is that this process leads to the monopoly of worldwide brands that dictete thier own terms. Customers are not only limited with selections of a variety of goods, they are also have to pay the price that have been set by there brands. Moreover, these actions are completely unprofitable for economy of a country and slows down the process of globalization and global economy. That means that countries that have market economy could not exist with the monopoly and it can lead to the destruction of the political system.
As for profits, such global companies are well-known and give a gerentee for their goods. Customers are considered to prefer the brands that are very common, so as not to risk.

To sum it all up, overall I do believe that the drawbacks are greater than the benefits. The process of replacing small business can lead to monopoly and destruction of the market system.",60,2,0

Moreover, such process can solve the problems which is conected with money. Nowadays, a great deal of people do not work and have not opportunity to buy necessary goods for their family and children. So, international companies ca provide a lot of work place in such areas for poor people. But there is no coin without the other side. First, in developing countries there are a lot of people who have not necessary education for working in companies of world level. So it can lead to unseccesful work of these companies. Also, such businesses, as a rule, require workers with knowledge in a special area. And last but not least, to open business in other countries a company should spend a lot of money and as a result in can be unrational decision. To put it in a nutshell, I would like to stress that arguments for the later idea cary more weight.

On the one hand, in the Earth much more women than men. Due to this fact the number of female students is much more in any groups; if the subject of the interest is equal for each sex. For example, in schools the number of female students are doubled in comparative with male students.
On the other hand, there is the main difference why in Universities there is such a great unequally number of male and female students. This is a specialization of university and subject. For example, in technical universities accept more male student,  because female studens do not give the documents to university. Men are better in maths, physics or astronomy. It will be silly accept, for instance, 2 women and 2 men, if it would be better accept 4 male students with the highest score, than female students who have minimal results.
To sum up, the idea to accept equal number of men and women in Univerities are unreal, because the following system do not give an opportunity to go to university due to studen’s sex.

In my humble opinion, happiness indeed is a key ti success. I believe that happiness include good health, good relationships with friends and parents.
In majority cases people tend to agree with position like my, but there are a lot of people which are constantly disagree.
Happiness depends on good health. By and large, good health helps to keep moving forvard and never give up. More over, happiness is a feeling when you achieve success. That's why it is so important to be fan of your own work, love your job and be totally inspired. 
Happiness as for me never depends on money, or wealthness, at whole. But money is a important tool effording to achieve total success. I want to highlight, that you cab be poorman but happy, and, you can became rich, but never be happy. It's not by chance, a lot of richmen have personal phsy-couch.

There are two main opinions: the one is that athelets should not be banned for the rest of their career if they are caught in this crime; another is that they should. It is a dual problem, so this essay will discuss both points of view.
The first point is that athlets, who use illegal drugs, should not attend competitions for a limited period of time. This opinion may be appropriate, because drugs will leave the organism after some time, and their influence would not be usefull. On the other hand, there is no doubt that this situation may be repeated after the limited of time, so there is no point that this kind of atheletes should be banned forever.
On the contrary, others support the last idea of the previous passage. They think that professional atheletes should not even try to use special sport medications. This point of view is reasonable too. It is not fair that drugs-free athletes should participate on competitions with persons, who are more powerful and whose power was provided by illegal support. In this case, it is vital to restrickt the access to professional competitions for overdrugged athelets. Though, it is not necessery to ban them from participation in non-professional competitions.
To conclude, both views on the problem of illegal drugs and their importance in the professional sport have a chance to be discussed. As for me, I strongly believe that athelets, who used illegal drugs once, should not be acceptable for a professional competitions, because their achievements are not true and fair, and I think if someone commit a crime once, he or she would repeat it after some time. Of course, I have no right to judge somebody, but rules of sport should be strict.

I partly agree with the opinion that artists can express their ideas in whichever way they wish.
I firmly believe that people should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas, because that is one of human rights - to express freedom, to express our ideas. That is what everyone should get from democratic society and government. As a result of expressing freedom and ideas of creative artist we can observe the development of art.
But there are some notions we should consider. Firstly, the freedom to express ideas in whichever way we wish can hold to situations then the ""product"" of someone's expression of idea can not be suitable and acceptable for other people. There is the pluralism of values and opinions in our society, that is why some one's art can hurt feelings of citizens.
Secondly, not every piece of art must be allowed. Especially, then we speak about some pornographic art that should be accept for common public, especially for children.
Thirdly, we should notice that some kind of art need government restrictions. It is widely acceptable that ""art"" that can be recognized as illegal must be controlled by the government.
In conclusion, I want to underline that nobody can restrict our freedom. The development of art shows the difference between generations and enrich our culture. But on the other hand - not every art must be allowed and acceptable.

It is caused by TV and other devices, such as computers and e-books, which make sit or lie almost for the whole day. Year by year it becomes a reason of bad posture, problems with legs, increasing weight and finally inability to walk without someone’s help. To not let this happen one should train for about 30 minutes a day using any method he or she likes: playing football or basketball, going to the gym or just running. 

All in all, these are not the only health problems which are faced by people nowadays. However, most of them can be avoided if we try to prevent the reasons that cause them even before the actual issues happen.

Other believe that it is possible to change character by developing our minds and physical body. In my opinion, people easy could change by developing different sides of life.
The simplest example when development breaks the nature is body changing. Some people say that it is impossible to keep fit because their genetic characteristics do not allow them to be skinny. It is not true because one boy from the USA brouke that ""rule"". His weight was about 250 kilograms and he started to do sports and keep on a diet. After a year and a half his weight was 89 kilograms! Everything is possible!
Speaking about mind and personal characteristics everything is not so simple, but possible. The main thing is a desire! If somebody disided to change mind, he/she would do it. There are a lot of ""helpers"" like books, smart TVshows or radio programmes. Also, it is really exiting to take part in differend scientific projects. As an example I tell a story of my sister. At school she was really lazy and had only bad marks. After graduation she understood that her life is going to be really boring and useless, so she started to read books and interested in chemistry, now she is the best student at university.
To sum it up, people could change and everything is in people's hands, the maing thing is desire and working, instead of your genetic characteristics. Personally I think that development is the right way to change yourself. Maybe some characteristics we are born with can not be changed, but it is possible.

Different people have different opinions. My point of view is that there are many advanteges in pirate copies.
To begin with, I want to say that illegal copies are very helpful for people who can’t pay for the original discs. For instance, today because of crisis in Russia people have a lack of money. But they really want to listen to music and watch latest films. So, the only thing they can do is downloading these pirate copies. Moreover, I want to notice that original discs cost big money but their content is not always good. I think, only a few number of original discs should be distributed by producers because they must assess their products adequately.
However, some people won’t agree with me. Firstly, a lot of people worked to produce music or film. They consider that their work deserve money. Secondly, not all illegal pirate copies have really high quality.
As for me, today the technical progress goes on. You can always find a good copy of music or film. Sometimes you should wait a little bit to get it. Moreover, if you are good in working on computers, you can download programms and change the quality of product. 
In conclusion I want to say, that I don’t agree that people who download pirate copies should be punished. This is your own choice which version do you want to have original or copy. Nobody can punish you for making choice. I think, just before you will decide to buy or download music or film you should understand about all advantages and disadvanteges of your choice.

Many of them are available in the Internet but almost all of them are illegal pirate copies. It is restricted to copy and share files by government rules therefore people have to be punished.
First of all, there are many international rules that don’t allow to download pirate versions of films and songs. With the development of technical devices and World Wide Net it has become very popular to get money from such network activity. People are against the law because they are not the authors of this or that film but they use it in an illegal way.
Secondly, people who copy original files without any permission decrease the income of musicians or film producers. It is clearly seen that authors loose a lot of money. Moreover, it takes a lot of time and efforts to make a film but not copying. The level of selled original discs sharply decreased when it became to be expanded. Individuals and groups of people work together and persuade companies to make films but pirate copies are able to lower their income very much. Furthermore, people got accustomed to watching pirate versions and they even believe that it is legal. No one wants to spend much money on discs therefore this problem can be called very serious in today’s world.
To sum up, it should be said that people have to stop downloading pirate copies of original versions if they don’t want to do something against the law. It prevents from increasing the budget of companies that make films, which everyone likes to enjoy. Unfortunately, punishment is the only strong method to stop it.

The sanctions should be levied on the person copying material which is the ownership of a company or other individuals and such cases should be brought to court.
One of the reasons for that is that pirate copying eliminates the profit of producers of such goods. The idea is the following: every product including music records and films considers in its price the cost of factors used in its production – labour, capital, enterpreneurship skills and so on – and some extra amount of money to bring profit to producers. For example, the production of bread consists of the cost  of ingredients, cost of baker labour and etc. When people go to the store to buy bread, they pay for free (excluding some “free bread for pensioners”). If they do, they commit a crime and should go to jail. The films and music are no difference, just the price of them is distributed among several people or things (like tickets in the movie theatre or CD-disks). So if a person does not pay for the usage of those he/she should be punished the same way, as a bread-thief.
Moreover, illegal sharing of films and movies discriminates the ownership rights of producers. The goods they make are not public and can be easily excluded from consumption therefore every usageof those goods should bring profit. It is easier if consider it as a patent. Until patent cost is less then profit, the innovations will be made (so new movies will be filmed). If patients fail (firm does not gain profit from extra production) the profit of the firm becomes negative, which means no innovations. Nobody wants not to be paid for their work. This situation can be overcome only by government intervention by subsidising the production of special goods or sponsoring their own production. Thus, government failures occur too often, so in the end ordinary users will not be able to consume the same amount and variety of goods (including films and music records). Therefore, there should be established a working judicial system to protect the ownership rights with decent punishment for not obeying the rules in order to provide people with their favourite music and movies.
To sum up, special laws should be established to protects the rights of producers and provide various products for people’s use.

The least important opportunity for both categories was learning about ways to help others because only 35% of women and 25% of men said that it was the min reason of using Facebook.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, after analysing the information given it can be stated that the use of Facebook on mobile increased, while the using on Desktop declined during the period under discussion.

There are so many ways to express your thoghts and feelings. People from ancient times show their ideas and thoughts by paintings and music. A lot of paintings of famous authors are held now in different galleries and big amount of people see them every day. But in long time ago just really talanted people become famous and well known artists.


Now situation is different. Every person can become an artist. Sometimes, people don't think how their ideas and works would influence other people's minds. Too many untalanted and unproffesional people create music, movies and paintings. It is really hard for a good artist to show himself in such amount of untalanted people.


In my opinion, government should allowed to express ideas and thoughts stronly really good artists. I their ideas are clear and they have something to show and tell people, they should do it. But if artist's works don't have any idea or logic or it can't bring anything good to public, there is nothing to show.


Every person have a chance to show itself by any way he choose. But at first, we should think, if he really wants it and if she really have something to say and show to bublicity. Only really good works should be shown to people, because it can influence them and their minds a lot.

Others believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime.

Nowadays people of different professions are arguing about punishmets for prisoners who commited a crime.Some of them state that living in the cells in prison for a long time is a good way for criminal to change and become a good person. Others can not agree with that point of view and they are looking forward to create new procedures of recovering.
Fist of all, we should not forget that in ancient times in all big and developing countries in the courts judges usually made verdicts that took people's lives. All the citizens followed the process and then the criminal was accused and sent to the death thay went to the main square in their city and looked at the punishment. It was very cruel and violent but goverment suggested that such public performance helped them to keep their power and prove that their political decisions were right. However, nowadays human rights exist and most of countries signed an agreement where they had rejected killing criminals.
Secondly, long sentences can be very useful if the atmosphere of this facility is helping criminals to unedrstand their gilt, to apologise themselves and others, to become a new person and be ready to return to the society. Of course, it sounds very idealistic but I think that it should be the main purpose of each prison. Moreover, the prison's stuff should not fight with the criminals and hurt them, they all should undestand their psycological and physical problems and try to help them to deal with it.
To conclude, I would like to say that at the moment there is no good way to turn a criminal into normal person. On one hand people who are against prisons do not propose other options of making criminals better. On the other hand, long sentences can be very tough for an unstable minds of a criminals and even can kill them.

For example, some man has lost his job and some kind of black line started in his life, this monthly sum of money can help him to overcome this hurdles.
On the other hand, where government is going to get money for this? All the money that government spends on social problems is payed from working citizens’ budget. Thus it means that such system requires increasing taxes, which will affect lower classes.

People all over the world try to understand the causes of these actions. In this essay I will suggest the main causes of this problem and possible solutions that can be taken to diminish the number of crimes.
There are loads of people who have problems and they are eager to make fortune and these people find that crimes can help them. Moreover, such behaviour comes from families, because young people are suffered from the lack of attention and they want to show them. What is more, nowadays, TV and the Internet have a great impact on people's lives. There can be seen violence, dire actions, and teens want to repeat these actions in real life.
The first possible solution that can be undertaken is limit the time in front of the Tv and the Internet. Parents should pay more attention to their childern and curb the time, spending in front of computers.Besides, parents spend their free time at the reastaurants with friends, or they go shopping, while young people do not know what to do and they meet new friends on the Internet, who can have an unpleasant impact on adolescents. In thic case, parents should spend more time with their children and then young people understand that they can rely on parents in any situation and difficulties.
The second solution is to increase phycical exercises and talk with the psychologist if they have some problems. It will help them to boost the motivation and , of course, the professionals can explain them to overcome hurdles. What is more, teachers should show their students that there are many ways to tackle problems and

Nowadays males and females are supposed to have equal possibilities, but it is often noticed that there are more male students studying some subjects, while other faculties have more females. Whether it is a fair situation is an issue worth discussing.
From one point of view, human rights allow ant student to choose what subject he/she wants to study, so it should be so, that the numbers of male and female in every area is equal. Moreover, there are some benefits from a community with participants of different gender – it is known that in such group there are less arguments, tension and the atmosphere all in all is much less aggressive. That in its turn leads to a more productive work and cooperation, which is vital in a studying institution.
However, there is another side to the problem. Is this situation of inequality based only on the preferences of the university or are the very students responsible for it? Usually females prefer to study humanities, while males are more interested in mathematics, therefore some faculties have more students of the same gender. Clearly, it will be highly inproductive to give a place in the university basing only on the gender and not on the person’s abilities and skills.
All things considered, it can be said that the problem of gender equality is still as important as ever. In my personal opinion, trying to accept an equal amount of males and females in every subject is a wrong way to deal with the problem, because then some more talented students can be discriminated because if their gender.

Firstly, it is undeniable that the level of life will boom up, because most citizens will get a chance to live better. These opportunities, which open behind most people, will benefit the economy of every country from one hand.
Secondly, as far as I consider, the level of education will grow up. And as a consequence of it, there will be more educated people, which will study all spheres of life properly.
However, a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system needs a lot of money, which government will take from the budget. As a result, we have a lot of risks that the economy will go done immediately. It is important to understand the basis of work of our basic economic system and take into account that the balance is much better variant for the country itself.
In conclusion, it is obvious that the system of guaranteed basic income has a majority of advantages for people’s level of life but still it doesn’t outweigh the disadvantages it has because of risks.

Secondly, government, politicians, lawers, attorneys and other officials should pay their attention into the problem of illegal pirate copies and direct the governmental policy to this direction. Governmental support in this case is the highly important element.

Thirdly, all Internet users should understand that copying or downloading information with the mark C (or with others with same meaning) is illegal. That is why every website should contain at least one paragraph with information why it is illegal (links on particular documents).

Finally, we should change the fact that speaking about the Internet we imagine absolutely free and independent area. This rude mistake leads to idea that every action on the Internet is unreal, but it is not true.

As can be seen from the chart, the development of printed books was on its peak in the USA in 2014 and was falling down in all countries after that. The vast minority of people spent the lowest amount of money on eBooks in China in 2014. The development of electronic books in the nearest future supposedly will fall dramatically in all countries beside the USA where it will get the highest point. The popularity of paper books is also forecasted to decrease throughout the time.
Judging by the information given, the biggest difference in providing books can be seen in the USA and Germany in 2014 when the amount of eBooks developed has dropped from 5,5 billion US dollars to only one.In the UK all kind of books were almost equal and fluctuations were not so noticeable.

The First one gives information about approximation of goods, whiche were transported by rail. Because of high weight of metals, It takes more percents in goods transfer's by rail (It is about 35%) than by road (11%). Of course, manufactured goods also have a significant part in amount of goods transporations (about quarter of all traffic) by the same reason — huge weight. But, with comparison with second diagram, which shows that manufactured good's part is 28%, 25% is a standart quota
The second one represents, how goods are transported by raod: The largest part of amount belongs to food products with 30 percents. The main reason of this fact is that car is quicker, faster, non-flexible way to transport food to final destination than troin. Aniway, both diagrams just represent numbers, instead of reasons of these numbers.

Preferences for other social networks vary. Instagram is used by more than half of the 18-29 year old age group, but it is clearly unpopular among older adults. Starting with people aged 30 and above, it drastically falls in popularity, with only one quarter of adults aged 30-49 using it, and then dropping to roughly 10% for adults aged 50 and above.

This trend is reversed with LinkedIn. Young people do not use it as much as they use Facebook or Instagram, with only 22 percent of adults aged 18-29 reporting that they use it. However, being a professional network, it is reported that it is used by roughly one third of adults aged 30 to 64, falling to 22% for adults older than 65.",70,1,1

The highest number of boys and girls who didn't get a primary education was in 2000 in Africa. It was 20 million boys and just under 45 million girls. For the both genders, it was the peak, if we see over the global period. But by 2012, the number of boys without primary education in that region decreased for more than 25%. And the amount of girls at the same time fall for the more than 5 millions in Africa. The number of girls who didn't can get a primary education in South Asia was more than 20 millions in 2000, but during the next twelve years it declined to the number of 4,8 millions.

Thousands of people every day use air transport to travel: to visit their family, attend a buisness meeting or to have a vacation somwhere far away from home.
It is an unfortunate thing, of course, that right now humanity is doing its best to destroy the beautiful planet they inhabit. Every minute the poisonous gas polluts the air, toxic materials are being thrown into the ground and in the water. And even if it seems that the government is trying to do something about the matter, Earth is still suffocating. Is paying money (fines or taxes) for an extra fliht a good thing? Maybe. If it is a plane with a lot of people inside, they can probably afford to pay a little bit more for the tickets. Some individuals own a private jets, there will not be many passengers, but if a person can buy a jet, they can definetely pay a tax.

But here comes another problem, how can we be sure that the money indeed will be used to fix the problems with the air pollution and global warming? It is not always easy, trusting your government, that is why paying more for the air transportation can cause protests among the population. That a solid argument and a good reason why legal actions (laws etc.) seem to be too radical and shouldn't be written. The people will get rebellious if the government takes something so important and valuable away.

To sum this up, I would like to state that I consider laws reducing some kinds of air transportation too radical. But I would be pleased if one had to pay some kind of tax for unnecessary use of plains or jets.",60,2,1

And many people say that such services should be included in high school. The most popular ideas have always been causing very exciting discussionsand debates. Personally, I agree with the statement that such programes should be included and students should spend their time on altruistic jobs.
Firstly, we all do realise that working for a charity, helping old people, taking care about animals, which live on streets, are very important for our society.
The other think is that such occupation allow students to feel all good and bad sides of our world. It extend their life views.
Furthermore, many students will choose their future job. Becouse such practise may help them to understand that there are a lot of occupations, which change our world. The other equally important aspect is that unpaid services give a chance to understand that money is not the only reason for working.

For that reason, authorities want to make laws to harden air travelling for business or entertainment uses.
On the other hand, fuels that planes produce can damage our planet, react badly on population’s health. Moreover, nowadays millioners or politicians are used to use air traveling not in important activities. For them, plane or helicopter is an usual sort of transport that can be expluatated to go to the luxury doubled harmful impact of airplanes to our environment. In these reasons, of course, air travel should be reduced or forbidden.
But on the other hand, it is known that plane s the safetiest type of transport. There is lower level of accidents involving this type of travelling compared with cars or ships. Furthermore, going by plane is the fastest way to achieve every corner of the world. However, it is not so cheap like train, it provides comfortable facilities and confidence that you will not be late. So, the fact of reduction the amount of air travel will definitely go to transport collaps. It leads to people’s disappointment and unsatisfied reaction to government decision.
All things considered	, I find that law unaproppriated and without any chance to exist. Modern society depends on daily migration, travellings and so on, so it is hard to imagine that this huge number of flights ill be delighted or cancelled. May be, the possible sollution is in scientists’ hands, because they can invent new energy for planes that could be not as harmful as it is now.

While some citizens claim that it is necessary to provide more sports facilities, others believe that it is not useful and that we need to solve this problem in an another way.
According to the first point of view we need to expand the variety of sports for the society. It can be achieved by building new sports school or by reducing the price of attending section. The government also can contribute money in new equipment in schools or in the streets. People believe, that in this case sport will be available for all who want to improve their health. 
However, great public heath can be achieves by taking another measures. Firstly, the government can built new hospitals and offer free medical observation, for example, once a year. Secondly, the healthy way of life should be promoted on TV or by the celebrities. It can motivate young people too keep a diet or to go in for sports. The one another option is to around population for their results in improving their health. It can be some competitions with significant prizes. As a rule, people are motivated by desire to win something or to become the first among others. And, of course, we need to prevent air, and water pollution what influence our health a lot.
In conclusion I would like to say that it is not effective to offer some options if people do not want to participate in it. We need to wake their minds and to convince that our health is necessary and that we need to take care of it by ourselves.

Many people believe that the most effective way is to increase prison sentences; others claim there are better alternatives. From my perspective, I would rather agree with the second group.
On the one hand, making criminals sitting in cells for a longer time might have its benefits. Firstly, people may become more afraid of such serious consequences of their illigal activity. This fact may become a strong remedy for the problem. Moreover, this new rule might reduce the repetetive crimes because it is highly unlikely for people who have spend enormous amount of time in prison to make crimes again.
On the other hand, I beleive it is more effective to eleminate the problem from its root. First of all, due to better education and proper life circumstances the amount of criminals will decline. Schools should develop such qualities as high morality and humanity in children which may result in their future lifeviews. So people with such views will not be able to commit a crime because of them. Good economics and level of life will also reduce the need of making crimes. Secondly, I beleive government should develop high level of citizen consiousness in people, what also may affect positevely on a discussed problem.
In conclusion, I would say that longer prison sentences, benefical as they are, will not be the best solution to high level of criminality. It is more effective to develop inner consiousness and provide people with proper education and means to live honestly.",60,2,0

To my mind, the mein part of health is health-food, for example, vegetables, nuts and fruits. Every people should not eat fust-food and prefer vegetables, because there are a good elements for health in there. Also, I think, that governments should produce TV program about health, for instance, “How to be health” or “Yoja”. So, people could do exercise in home near TV. For example, in my country there is a good TV program “Jivi”. This channel shows how to do some exercise in sports and also talk about health-food. It help my famaly be okey.

Art can induce aversion, incomprehension, stupor or fear, especially modern component.

Governments believe, that a lot of air travel is not so important and it should be better to introduce new laws to reduce the number of air travel for leisure and business. As for me, I can’t totally agree with one of these statements, because they both are right.
On one hand, people live on our planet for a lot of years, for millions of years. So they affected the environment for a long time. Moreover, we destroy our planet over and over again. In our modern world, full of new technologies of destruction, we must to take care of our planet more, then ever. And it’s possible to understand opinion of governments, because they take care of ecology. It’s not a bad idea to create some new laws to contor the amount of air travel. However, where are a lot of questions without asks. For example, how they will decide who can travel and who can’t? If I want to travel abroad on the plane to see Paris for a second time, what should I do? Actually, there are a lot of such questions. Ecological problem is very serious, but is it right to said people what should they do? I really wan’t to fly abroad do why should I ask anyone about it? It’s a free world, where you can visited any country for any reason. This is the other point of view.
To conclude, I’d must to say that I think, that the second point of view is more correctly, because we can’t safe our planet, it’s too late, but can help to take care of her by other way. Reduce the amount of air travel is not the best method. We can find something better.

On the one hand, the freedom can give different ways to show what you can do. For example, Internet provides a lot of ways for showing photography, museums for showing pictures. You can record the song and give it to the radio station. As a result, people receive new music hit, beautiful photo or interesting film. Also, the freedom provide your chance to find, that you want to do in life. But is there only pluses?
On the other hand, such freedom can be dangerous for all. People use their possibility for bad ideas. It can lead to mistakes. Such as bad opinion or, in some cases, revolution. Our children listen to music in internet and we cannot control all that they do. Some clips and video is awful. Is it OK, that child singing russian rap? No. It should be under control.
As a result, I disagree with this opinion. If there is no government restriction, it will have bad and negative result. I cannot say, that government have to strongly control all actions, but there are must be different rules. In some cases, government have to support creative people to open and show their own talants and ideas and give him right way to do this.

More and more people claim or headaches or heart diseases and hospitals are always full of clients. This essay proves that technologies cause many health problems today. 

First of all, devices allow to stay home as much as possible. From your seat you can do shopping, learn, order food and so on. All this possibilities cause the lack of moving. That is why many modern people, including children, suffer from overweight. Your smartphone or tablet take your motivation to move, walk, do sport. However, there is a solution of this problem and all depend on you. It is necessary to make yourself do easy things independently. You can use any possibility to move: go shopping, walking and so on. 

Secondly, the screens of our devices affect our vision negatively. Our eyes do not relax, they concentrate small letters, pictures and as a result, we watch worse that we must. Specialists advise to take breaks: during your work or another using of technologies it is useful to watch through the window or some things that surround you.

In addition, the use of devices often cause headaches because of the huge spread of formation. Our brain cannot recycle al the information we receive. So it could be useful t to filter what we read, watch or listen to or to take only necessary information that you need at the current moment. 

In conclusion, modern technologies are not something bad. We cannot decline their utility however we should have some limits of their using. Our organs and health mustn’t suffer from devices.

While many people think it is best for the society to send people to prison for longer times. Others believe there are better and more effective ways to deal with crime. Giving criminals longer sentences is a good measure. Firstly, a long sentence will prevent many people thinking about communitting a crime from actually doing it. Secondly, the longer the longer a person spends in pirson after breaking the law, the more they are able to rehabilitate, to think, and to learn to become a law – abiding citizen after being released. On the other side, people say, that harsh prison conditions and spending time with other prisoners can do even more harm to a criminal. Good alternative are probation and community service. They let a criminal life in a normal society and interact with people whole being observed and controlled. In addition to this, there may be some measures for government to prevent crime by building a safer environment. In my opinion, introducing large prison sentences is not good enough, as it has been happening in many countries all over the global, while crime rates are rapidly growing. Obviously, while long sentences up to life should remain a punishment for the most dangerous falonies it is important that we seek other ways of reducing crime and waking world safer place to live.

TASK 2
	Nowadays a lot of people care about their health. What is the best way to improve public health? Some people think that sport can help, but others believe that doing sports is not enough and there should be applied other measures.
	On the one hand, more than a half of population prefer not to do sports. Their lifestyle is really calm and without without any extractions, so because of the lack of movements and sports activities public health is getting worse. In this case the measure of increasing the number of sports facilities would help to boost people's immune system. Moreover, doing exercises is a really good way to make us stronger and healthier. It helps also to be fit. But sport provide not only phsysical health but the mental one. For example, doing ioga is a good solution for those people, who want to find a balance in their life.
	But there is another point of view. A lot of people suggest that increasing the number of sports facilities would not have an effect on public health. They believe that other measures should be required. To their's opinion, a person should not only do sports but also eat healthy food and spend as much time on the fresh air as it possible.
	To be honest, I think that an increas in the number of sports facilities could be a great measure for improving public health. I suppose, that not everybody has an opportunity to go to a gym or take, for example, dancing classes. By doing sports facilities more common and maybe cheaper it would be quite easier to make people healthier. As for me, I am trying to be as much active as I can and I go to a fitness club three times a week. I believe that sport helps me to stay healthy. So, sport really affects our lifes.
	Having considered all these statements, I can come to a conclusion that of course, making public health better is not easy, but it is really important to understand that without sports activities a person can not be really healthy. So, increasing the number of sports facilities is a good step to improving the health of population. But the best results can be achieved if people will not only doing sports but also applying complex measures, such as eating healthy and avoiding stress factors.

To begin with, it is worh saying that any vehical can damage the nature (not only plants and animals but also the Humanity): air planes produce special gazes which pollute the atmosphere (moreover, it is unnecessary to say, that every plane crush can kill several cube kilometers the live beings).What is more, all this time the government closes its eyes when this question rises but if it create a special law and control the situation, everything can dramatically change; the amount of flights will be minimised and the nature will be saved (but some international companies will lose lots and lots of money (and a lot of people will be hired)).
On the other hand, it sounds strange: the law which is made for the reducing air flights.That is why I see another solvation: the only way to improve this situation is to creat a grant for scientists (of all the countries). So they would invent the new type of planes which would be ""pollution free"" and its using would not cause any climat problems.However, there is a long way because it should be done in all the countries (including small ones where the cheep and old versions of flying vehicles are used (because they pollute more then others)): so all people should unite to provide our grandchildren with fresh and clean air, with the possibility to see white bears and penguins (which would not extinct because of global warming) etc.
All in all, the wisest way to solve the problem with environment (caused by air planes) is to modernise all the flying vehicles in the World (however it is the longest and the most expensive but at the same time the most effective way).",55,2,0

I can’t agree or disagree with with this statement because our world is very complicated and we have both good and bad examples on each side. For instance there are many extreamly small countries which is very reach like Monaco, Singapure, Hong Kong and etc. Also there are many big countries which sometimes need to import food like Turkey or Egypt. Let’s see to this problem more carefully.

On the one hand there are many advantages produce enough food for population. The main advantage of this is independence of other countries. Of course, it is very good then noone can manipulate you by food prices, but also you can sell the food which your population didn’t eat. It’s OK if you can produce food by yourself, but what if not?

On the other hand there are countries which can’t produce enoght food for their population. There are two kind of this countries: first kind is poor countries which can’t produce or import enough food for population - like countries in Africa, second kind is developing or developed countries which could get enough food. We will speak about second kind. Very often countries which import food are more developed than countries which exports food. In my opinion that countries don’t need to produce food by themselves because many citizens of this countries work not in real sector, but in financial or science capacitive sectors, like in Swetzerlang.

Also there are small countries like Singapore or Macao thich haven’t enough territory to produce food. It is not very bad for this countries because lack of resources helped to increase economics in there.

To sum up, there isn’t one solution of food import problem for all countries. The solution depends on many factors and something which could be good for Russia at the same time could be bad for Hong Kong.

To my mind some simple things can make people feel good and this things are part of human happiness.
Some people think that happiness depends on how mach money you have, others belueve thet if you have a great health you will be happy, but if yiu had some money to buy a flat and maybe a house to go there for weekends, will you be extremely happy? Also,  tyhere are so many things to buy, but often people wants to buy more and more. Unfortunately they become depressed if they can't buy something.
On tyhe other hand, some small things can give us many positive emotions, like your son when he get a good mark at school or your favourite dog. So to be happy at the moment you can just be with your loved person or your family. 
In conclusion I want to say that as many person people as many opinions. Each person me  or you understands happiness in different ways, but if yoiu know what you need to be happy, please do it! There are so many factors such as health, money your family, all of this makes people believe in good future and be happy at the moment.

The proportion of the citizens aged 65 and over was stable between 1960 and 1987. However, the percentage of Japanes aged 65 and over rose from 1987 untill reached the stage of near 7% at 2014.

As for the number of the population aged 65 and over in Sweden and USA, there was a steadily rise with slight falling and some flactuations.

They believe this agreement will have a good effect on the total results. Let’s have a good look at this issue.
From my point of view there is no need to establish equal number of male and female students in a group. First of all, that is a known fact that men are better in subjects which can be quite difficult for women. For example, engeneering seems to be easy for male, especially when they study cars, while women more often need a couple more hours to understand a mechanism. Secondly, that is usually difficult and is not worth-wasting time to study a subject person is not interested in. Scientists say that the more person is fascinated about a subject  (for instance, German language), the less time and energy is necessary to remember new information. Both these examples show that studying a subject which is not interesting and is difficult will not bring better results finally.
However, some people are sure that the number of men and wonen studying in a group should be equal. Firstly, that helps cooperation between these two genders. In addition, there is a problem that there are too many programmists who are men and doctors who are women. Some people think that discrimination according to the gender may appear in the future (for example, on job interviews).
In conclusion, there is an opinion that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. However, I think that this reform will not effect positively on students’ results.

But have this networks for only the aim to nature your free time less boring or it contain also some useful information? There are a lot of discussion about the real goal of social media such as Facebook or Vkontacte: to make people’s free time happy or to educate them. In this essay I will look on both opinions and support each of them with examples. First of all, both these social networks were created as a means of communication for classmates of people form one university. For example, Facebook was created as a place for American students where they can share with useful files for education. On the other hand, the way of using these web-sites has changed a lot. There are a lot of times or applications which make people to waste their time. It was made an interesting experiment when people stop using Vkontakte or Facebook about one week and as a result their productivity more then doubled. It shows that all funny videos take a lot of our time and distruct us from work. Another opinion bed less common is that these networks are made up by a lot of information which can be very helpful for education. It can be taken as a result different groups as “Just English” or “lazy English”, for instance, which just on the Internet different articles or videos in English which are not get a lot of time but it is very helpful for those who want to learn English. But in contrast, not all people tend to follow groups with such content replacing it with different groups with jokes or silly videos or pictures with cats. According to conducted servay more than there fourth of users use social networks as a way to relax after school, university of work. In conclusion, there is still a lot of educational content in websites like Facebook, but it always depends only on people’s needs and wishes how to use the chance for self-development. Because even academic books can be used in a wrong way don’t let people develop themselves.

However, not all people support this idea, because they think that there are other more effective measures to maintain the health of the people.


In my opinion, sport facilities can have a certain effect on health level of the society. It is true that sport prevents people from negative effects, such as obesity, but it can not cope with cancer or AIDS. And there is no scientific proof that sport helps to prevent regular diseases. Generally, the sport and sport facilities are necessary for the public, but sport should not be regarded as a multi-objective healthcare subject. Yes, it will prevent a person from having a heart strike, but, as it is before mentioned, the range of the correlation between sport and general preservation of diseases is to small.


What is more important, to my mind, is how to prevent the children the children mortality and children diseases. Many diseases which a child can catch when he is young, can affect his health for the whole life, because the disease can learn how to cope with the immune system, so children are more defenceless to this issue.


There are few more ways to maintain the level of the public health. It is important to have a proper nutrition, e.g eating only natural food, and restrain from taking alcohol, tobacco, fast food, salt and other potentially dangerous products. Also, vitamins are worthy taking them because they help to balance all processes in the human body.


In conclusion, it is important to say, that not only sport is important, but the general health culture is what may help the society to stay fit and not to get sick.

There are some causes of this situation. In this essay I will provide the causes of this developement and suggest my solutions.
Firstly, the main cause of the growing level of crimes committed by young people nowadays is the lack of work places. Young people graduate from university and start searching for job, while they realise that there is no work places for them. This may trigger some criminal events, such as gambling for getting money, working illegaly and even commiting crimes just to survive. I think possible solution for this problem may be for the goverment to create more work places. Hovewer, this may cost a lot of money and take a lot of time. Another solution may be for the goverment to start a program that will help young people to find a job after the graduation without having a real work experience. With the help of this program, the level of crimes will drop.
Secondly, it is clear that a lot of crimes committed by young adults may be caused by alcohol, especially the ones that commited while driving a car. Crimes committed after drinking are happening often and they are a real problem nowadays. The solution for this problem may be restricting driving the car in unsober condition. This can prevent a lot of crimes and fatalties on the road, however, it will require more policemen and it is hard to put into work. Another solution for this problem may be for the goverment to restrict the sales of alcohol, for example, sale it to people who are older than 21 instead of 18, or sale it only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m..
To conclude, the level of crimes that are being comitted by young people is really high nowadays, and this problem remains unsolved. In my point of view, this problem needs to be tackled as soon as possible.",60,2,0

Talking about 1940, it can be clearly seen that in all countries the quantity of people aged 65 and over was not big: 5-10%. The difference between this criteria in Japan and other two countries is in the fact, that in Japan quantity of people aged 65 and over was decreasing to 1960, when in Sweden and USA this quantity was rising to about 1982. In Japan the quantiny of that people was at the same level from 1960 to about 1985, after that it started to grow.

But some people think that we should use other methods to improve public health.
On the one hand, those, who think that sport can help us in this problem, give their arguments. Firstly, a lot of people like sport, and if they have an opportunity, they will do different sports more actively. There is an example from my life: when I was little, we did not have enough sport facilities, but later our government decided to build gyms and places, where children can do sport. As a result, most of children in my school used to spend their free time on sport. Secondly, it is easier to develop sport, than to spend money on other measures, because lots of people can use a few facilities, On the contrary, if you want to improve medicine, you need to invent new ways how to treat people and only then use them, So it takes a lot of time.
On the other hand, some people are sure that sport is not the most appropriate way if you want to make people healthier. They explain their position with the fact that there is a part of society, who does not love sport, and it does not matter for them, if you increase the number of facilities or not. In this case, it is more likely to use more popular methods, which will have an influence on all people and will help to improve public health.
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is better to use differents measures at once, and then the results will be more evident and productive.

There are several reasons of this problem, and various measures can be taken by governement and state health department to improve the situation.

Reducing health tonus may be caused by variety of factors. Firstly, modern technology such as gadgets attract people to spend a lot of free time with smartphone games, whereas this free time could be spended on sports. Secondly, an absence of physical activities which leads to health problem is a result of virtual communication in the field of the Internet. For example, young adults and teenagers prefer chatting infront of laptops to teal meeting with friends and having some activities or just walking.

The best way to solve these problems would be encourage people to do sports and decrease using gadgets by means feeling of shame. State health department need to create alternative kind of physical activities which could be more attractive then standard exercises for health lifestile. In adittion, the government should create social programme whic could conclude sports festivals.

Some people believe that athlets who was identified as taking dopping should ban from competing for a period. However, others say that such athlets breake the rools and they should be banned from training at all to the end the life.
In my opinion, one unnormal step such as taking drugs is not a point to take him or her away from competition for the long period of time. Firstly, such beheaviour might be connected with the willingnes of be the winner of the one competition. Sportsmen train all their life to have the first place at world competition or in the Olympic Games, for example and taking drugs for such athlet is not a repeated tendendensy, but the only not right step.
Secondly, the athlet might be against such methods, but the coach, for example, might pressure on the sporsman to take additional tablet. Dopping is not always the desision of athlet and this case should be included in the punishment.
Nevertheless other people argue that if person take the wrong way first time would be and the second time. Such people believe that in competition there is always a big temptation to breake the rools and if sportsman do it, he or she must go out from the sport.
I have to disagree with that idea and say that taking drugs by athlet may be a nessesary step because of the health condition. In professional sport it is not an exeption that athlets broke legs or arms and they must to train despite the pain. Only helpful and important medical tablet could be presented too district commision as a dopping.
To sum up, I would like to say that the situations and conditions when sportsmen decide to take drugs to win competition or to be just stronger are very different. And it is important to give people a chance not to loose the profession.

The situation seems to be very dangerous and requires some particular actions.

Speaking about the causes of it, we should focus on some social problems which make teenagers and young people steal, burgle or even kill. Firstly, we should mention poverty. The lifestyle which doesn't let a person even know if he or she has some meal in a kitchen to eat for a day makes him/her steal because this sort of ""earning money"" looks as the quickest one. The main tragedy, as I believe, is that parents often teach their children do it. Many young families don't expect that to have children is a big responsability and then it turns out they are not able to feed their babies. Secondly,it lets many young people prove that they are at the same level with their peers, as risky and brave as they are. This is can be explained by lack of information, even isolation from society.

But still we can say that these problems can be solved. I assume that our government should pass some strict law about it. For example, I would propose exclude from school those guys who were constantly stealing some things/clothes/money or punish them by making clean the hall of school every day.Also, I believe that teachers should talk more about the adverse side of such ""games"", to consider some heroes from the world of literature, their destiny and concentrate on the fact of how some little crime affected their life. As for those who need money, I would offer to improve some services of social help and let these children eat for free at school.


In conclusion, I would like to say that these problems are very deep and there is no one decision for them. It is obvious that they require a lot of attention both from parents, teachers and from our government.",65,2,1

Some people support the idea of life-lasting disqualification for 'sport criminals'. Others do not share this point of view.
So, people who vote for banning sport professionals for the whole life believe that they have solid reasons for that. A person, who neglected the rules once, can do it again and again. Nobody will rely on him or her in the future. What is more, there will always be different rumors around this athlet Such a difficult and stressful situation may cause  depression and low self-estime. As a consiquence, a sportsman may never ever show brilliant results in his or her career.
Anyway, there is another opinion. The majority thinks that an athlete has an ability to make a mistake because he or her is just a human being. It is obvious that every man can once be let down. The society is sure that it is too strict to ban a sportsman and actually ruin his or her life because of some temporary troubles. The wise decision is to ban an athlet for a limited period of time. It will allow him or her a chance to rethink the illigal act he or her did in the past and then start from the blank shit of paper.
Personally I consider that the sportsmen should be given the second chance because the reasons of using drugs may be different. For example, Russian athletes used a medicine in 2015 that was legal in all countries and accepted by the World Commitee. But in 2016 this medicine was named as a restricted one, so, everyone stopped using it. Anyway, the organisms of Russian sportsmen saved the materials of the medicine and because of that the whole team had to stay in Russia and did not participate in the Winter Olympiade. What is more, the professionals were not guilty and they saved their careers, although were banned for 2 years.
To sum up, I would like to say that opinions on this theme can differ a lot but people should be more patient to each other and find compromises, because of that the judgement is always needed in each sport case.

For this purpose parents try to choose special schools for their children or even hire a personal tutor.
  I have a strong doubt, that it all can work efficiently, if a child doesn’t want to study foreign language. I can prove it with some arguments.
  First of all, learning foreign language consists not only from the class work. There are lots of things, students must do at home. But it is common when a child does not like a subject and quits doing homework, reading extra material, etc. In this case, if a child is completely against the subject, making him to learn it is just a violation. It’s better to wait until secondary school, and things will probably change.
  Then, no one can persuade a child to learn something by heart. And in learning any foreign language learning by heart is extremely important. But at primary school a child can be just unprepared to learn big amounts of material. He can just lack ability to do this because of his or her young age.
  And the final point is that in primary school a child has no idea of who he is going to be in future, exept dreams. So it is not known, whether he or she would need a foreign language or not. In secondary school student’s attitude towards himself is much more clear, he can start to think seriously about a sphere to work in.
  To sum it up, I can say that it is better to wait with making a decision when to start learning foreign language with your children. Otherwise you risk to spoil school years of your daughter or son.

Most of people think the best way to reduse the number of criminals and violence is to keep people in prisons for longer time, however not all the human beings think the same, so there are those who contradict to this point of view. On the one hand there are benifits of giving longer prison sentences. Staying for a long time in prison makes convict think about the harm he inflicted. If the prissoner commited a serious offence such as murder it takes a long time to bring his mentality to healthy level and to be sure that he is reeducated (he will not do such harm anymore). By the way longer prison sentences will act as an example for those who want to commeet the crime. On the other hand,taking care of criminals takes a lot of money. In developed countries they are kept in very good conditionds. However, they live on money that pay other people to government as taxes. Actually, it may mean that longer prison sentences, higher taxes.   In my opinion, it is important to look at alternative methods. Many countries have lengthy prison sentences, but crime has continued to increase throughout the world, so it is clear that this is not completely effective. That said, long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder, as justice for the victim and their family should take priority. To sum up, everything should be dosen and the government should create very severe conditions in prisons in order to prevent people think of the crimes.    ",60,2,1

Of course, that is an important thing to worry about because, unfortunately, global problems are becoming more and more actual for modern society. However, is it fair to put the blame on this kind of means of transport?
Personally, I strongly believe that life in 21st century without planes and so on is absolutely impossible. Firstly, everyday routine requires the possibility to get to some other countries and even continents in hours. To be honest, the technologies are not progressive enough to create a faster way to move around the world. People who obtain important posts just have no alternative but jet or plane if they have to get to, for example, the USA from Russia.
Secondly, other means of transport like cars, trains, ships also keep on having huge influence on our nature. The gas from cars pollutes roads, forest and other places people go, the need to build railways makes workers destroy already mentioned forests, change rivers' direction. There is no way of creating facilities for transport which can be totally safe for the planet.
Last but not least, the most dangerous enemy of the world is humans. All the places that we discover become comfortable for our relaxation, having fun or even working but extremely impossible for trees to grow, for animals to breed and for natural complexes to exist. We do not think about how the planet is going to survive our invasion and forget that we make it only worse that way for ourselves.

To make a conclusion, it is pretty important to understand that technologies are not going to stop its development because we have already got used to such speed of life. Scientists should do all their best to invent maximally exological means of air transport, cars, etc. All we can do is to try to respect the resources of our planet and take care about the word we think we own.",70,2,1

The problem of medical drugs being used in sport and punishment for this will be discussed in this essay.
Some people are concerned that the use of drug is affair of sportsmen who are who can not afford themselves to stick to the rules. But people believe that these sportsmen use the drugs for a special reason - they are adicted to the drugs as the can not compete without them. For instance, the use of medical tablets in an aim of being calm and conscentious during the competition or a game. In this situation sportsmen should not be banned from the sport for all their life only because of them being nervous, and panicked before and during the competition - such sportsmen are just in need of this help and they should not be blamed for the rest of their life.
However, other people believe that if sportsmen are into taking drugs as a help in the sport, they will never stop themselves from using them even after a punishment. This idea depictes that such sportsmen are satisfied with aim of winning the sport competition in any way and who does not matter about the honesty and clearness of the sport. The main rule of such sportsmen is: ""the aim is always worth of any sources"", and the solution of a problem of how such athletes should be punished lies in them being banned for the all time and left the sport.
To my way of thinking, people should not use drugs in the sport at all as it is a game that should never cost in nervous system suffering or in winning in any possible ways. Sticking to this idea, I can not agree neither with the first argument, nor with the second - the sport is only a game and it should be free from the medical support. However, there always will be people who are concerned about the use of drugs as a help for sportsmen being calm during their job and about them not be banned from the sport for the rest of their life only because of this. In spite of this, other people will always state that the sportsmen who use the drug once, tend to repeat the use of it again, and for such athletes there is no place in sport in any time and after any punishment.

Despite the fact that other counries make films too, they are still not as popular as their British and American competitors.
Needless to say that the USA is the only country which has a special area which is responsible for producing films and other kinds of entertaining products. Hollywood is a place that lures all sorts of talented people who's main aim is to produce a hich quality product. So the first reason why people worldwide love American films is that the USA has a developed industry with passionate gifted prople. Secondly, British and American films provide viewers with all kind of representation they need. In films produced in those countries we can see people of different nationalities, with different religious and cultural beliefs, etc. Moreover, there are a lot of British films that show people that a different from others and it makes viewers inspired. People love watch movies with characters who are just like them or have the same issues. On the contrary, local films mostly show just an average citizen of a country which is not only not interesting for local people but is also not so appealing to foreighners who might not understand local culture. Finally, as we have mentioned Hollywood, we should not also forget that films produced there cost a lot. Local companies producing films simply cannot afford to use visual effects, choose breathtaking locations or invite famous actors. That makes them less interesting to watch and thus less popular.
One possible solution that can make local films more popular is to provide film producing companies with financial support. It will help such companies forget about lack of money and make their wishes come true which will make films more exciting and complicated.
However, as far as I am concerned, governments should not give more financial support to local film companies. It is not that I am against the idea of financial support, it is just my firm belief that every country should do what it can do best and should not try to become successful in every sphere.",65,2,0

I personally believe that increase in number of sport facilities will not significantly change the situation in society. But as it always happens there is another view on this problem.
Firstly the position of people insisting on wide-scale measure to prevent decrease of public health will be analyzed. It is logical that human health depends not only on exercises that person takes but on the diet, pollution, style of his life and even luck (for example the number of car accidents can influence trends of overall public health). Knowing all this information, improvements in all spheres of life should be done in order to bring harmony into society. On the other hand rationally thinking people believe that sport undoubtfully play a huge role in health increasement. This leads to an easy option – just to build more sports facilities and do not increase budget of healthcare organisations of retirement houses.
However, I would like to give an example from my own experience. For the last two years in Moscow the number of sports facilities grew significantly and sport at all became more popular among people. But public health did not improve due to small budget of healthcare organisations and big number of immigrants from poor regions.
To sum it up it should be said that both positions are partially right and combined views are usually presenting better results for solving problems of humanity.

There are some argues about factors which influence our personality and therefore, our behaviour and future in society. Some of the researches show that the crucial points are the parameters we have when we were just born. However, there are those who do not agree with it, and I am one of them.
I generally believe that nearly the biggest impact on us has the way we were brought up by our parents, not just some mechanisms which we may or may not have after birth. Firstly, there are numerous examples showing that during a lifetime a person can change (both for better and for worse) and usually the milestone event happens in the early part of this life. Partly, it can be explained that before this turning point he had been influenced that before this turning point he has be influenced by parents and their views the world and other this point he may have had some insight of his own.
Furthermore, as far as it heard about the researches that proves that our personality is practicly determined the minute we are born, can not tell that they are very reliable just because of the methods. However, it can not call this idea completely senseless just because of genatics. Some of the illnesses we may have come from our genes and this fact for sure can our development, especially physical.
Most importantly, our every day experience influence us in a bigger matter than the genes. Even if a person has some disabilities that supposed to make him, for example, grumpy because of it, it is not ""must be"". Everything depends on the bookshe read, the films he like and the people who surround him. This base gives him certain way of thoughts , which determine him as a personality.
Summing up, I am absolutely do not agree that out picture mostly depends on out characteristics from birth. I say that everything is in our hands and depends on us. I hope that even the longest situations can change for better just because of a men's will.

Nowadays we have two largest social media like Facebook and Vkontakte. Some people think that the main purpose of these social media is to share knowledge and information with people. But others think that social media should entertain. On the one hand, in Facebook and Vkontakte people establish many different publics which depend on people’s interests. Person, who wants to share or find useful information can search for a needed public with information he is looking for. Also, in social media there are many people, who share their reports about famous people, news, developments and etc. while other people can find these reports in Facebook and Vkontakte and get new knowledge about whatever they want. On the other hand, in our modern society every one has smartphone or computer. People who use these devices can play in different games on it. Many games on smartphones are connected to network and people can play with their friends from Facebook and Vkontakte. Moreover, these social media provides different publics with funny pictures, images as known as demotivators. People, who are tired after the hard day like to read comics which social media also provides and seeing funny images, vides. In conclusion, I would like to share my point of view. I think that people who say that main purpose of social media to share information and knowledge are agree, while entertaining is also useful purpose of social media/ so, people can find and read something new and get useful knowledge. Also, when they want to relax and have a fun, they can watch videos and find funny pictures.

Nations should reduse the total amount of imported products. I totally agree with this station, because it is necessary for countries to have their own food products.

The quality of nutrition has great impact on people’s health. Different type of food are exported from many countries. Goods can be failed during a long transportation, for this reason a lot of companies use special medicines or pesticides. For example, farmers make special corn with harmful substances for chicken. Consuquently, birds grow faster and their meat can be saved in refrigerators for a long time. Moreover, this product is a reason for people’s illneses. Thus, governments should stopped buying products from another countries and try to start their own producing.

The independence in economic side is important for every country. The government should provide minimal amount of food for each person. In addition, there are some situations that proved the importance of own producing food for countries. For instance, economic crysic when people need in new job places. In this situation it will be right to build new factories for making food products. In this way, country can avoid critical situations for their economy and allow people to have a job.

In conclusion, I personally think that every country should improve conditions of producing food. People need to have reliable government, which can help and protect their in every situation.

In this case the community can lose future famous artists or actris. The second reason why the goverment shouldn’t stop artist because in this case the culture of country wouldn’t develop.
	On the other hand if the goverment give fully freedom to artist, they could doing something incorect for society, so should be particular rules which artish should follow, because if the rules will miss the choces can be start. Also goverments can support artists who only start their way, for example invest money in different organisations or institute where artist stading. Furthermore they can help to organisate some exsibitions, where artist can show their works to the public.

Secondly, school as the social institute can help with several problems. For example, every school must have a psychologist who will work with children, their problems and their solutions. Sometimes some teenagers want that someone will listen to them and hear them and it will help to confine  the emotions. 

Thirdly, the causes of the problem with the student behavior as I have mentioned are living in problems in the family and with the classmates. So, hobby sometimes can solve some problems.

The main reason for that can be spread of Internet and similar technologies, development of virtual reality where things are less controlled than in the real world.
Firstly, we should notice, that nowadays young people have access to much larger amounts of information than ever before. That results in fact, that they can easily get lot of know-how of committing crimes and, moreover, can be influenced by criminals, who wants to achieve their own purposes by doing dirty thing with someone’s other hands. It became easier for young people to get in the “wrong” companies, to contact criminals and be influenced by some stories and promices of better life. Real examples can be found in different groups in Vkontakte, where criminal HRs are working.
Consequently, we should mention another reason for that – lack, or inadequate amount of control. Government, public services are still unfamiliar with internet, it is often uneasy for old people to learn how to use it in full potential. Examples of it are in families too – children usually know much more about computer then their parents. The last can physically control, if their son is at home at night, but miss many connections that he makes in internet and expecially in social networks.
As a summary, I would like to offer several solutions to that problem – parents should care more about social activity of their child in internet and most of all – about his contacts there. If he chats with strange 40 years old man – that’s a bad signal. If he visits restricted forums via TOR – that is a very bad signal too. Police should also pay more attention to what is happening in the Internet – many crimes, if not all, have their roots there.

It is namely about the creative people such as designers, artists, etc. sometimes they have troubles with government and laws. This essay will observe this situation and give examples.
	Today, the creative profession are very popular. Everyone tend to express their feel and emotion. For example famous designer or photographer make the exhibitions with their works and projects. It is the means of expression of feels for ordinary people. However, the designers and artists who have no money to realize such events try to tell about their emotions on the city walls or in the Internet. A good example is graffiti artists. They have a talent which should be realise on the big space, but sometimes it is very difficult to find a needed place. The artists have not a access to place they need.
	On the other hand, the government have to look after the city life. Some-times the creative people do the things that can not be called like a moraly. The historical buildings are painted by the bad words. As a result of that the children learn more bad things from the streets. In case of his government should protect the culture of the city. There is needed to create a list of rules which is able to control the behaviour of the creative citizens. But there should be included the rights to freedom of expression, even though the government will not encourage artists. But nowadays, in Moscow the government likes to encourage the young creative people and tends to call they to improving the city space.
	All in all, the creative expression of feels needed to be controled by the governments. In my opinion it will be the best way of developing a social sphere of life by a tandem of ordinary creative people with the governments.

More and more people are concerned about the crime situation as well as the crime is increasing. Broadly speaking, the government and citizens consider that we should take action to prevent from crime problem. But, now should we take action? Some of people think that giving longer prison sentences is best way but I feel that there are better ways to reduce crimes which can give us more positive results. Firstly, the number of crimes increases in that countries in which the economical and social situation is most terrible. Often the poverty makes flavourable condition for new crime. Majority of citizens is not given an opportunities and prospects for living and surviving in the society. Some of them have to break law with aim for earning money. As result, the highest proportion of crimes belongs to poorest countries in which the governments do not take actions to solve economical and social problems. But on the other hand, some of crimes are not based on economical purposes. For instance, serial murders and corrupcy are crime issues for wealth countries as well as for poorest. So that’s why the governments  should give longer prison sentences for serious crimes. But at the same time they should reduce prison sentences for light crimes which do not pose a threat to the society. To sum up, the crime situation is not least serious problem as environment and poverty issues. In my opinion, we should take action together to reduce crime by not only prolonging sentences for serious crimes such prison as murders and corrupcy but improving social and economical conditions in the poorest countries and erasing inequities between rich and poor people.

Therefore a lot of people consider that there should be increased the amount of sports facilities, while the other claim it would be inappropriate. As far as I am concerned, I believe public health should be improved with the help of other measures.


Firstly, the process of improvement of public health requires modern  infrastructure that provides hospitals and other related services. Undoubtelly, only professional doctors are able to ensure our health. Secondly, public health is dependant on the food that we eat, that is why the government should care about its quality using certain measures.


However, people that follow the alternative point of view, are convinced that the best way to make people stay healthy is to provide more and more sports facilities. Furthermore, they suppose that organising special contests and events like the Olympiads would help a lot to improve public health because a lot of sports centers are built for such kinds of events.


To sum up, due to the fact that there exist two absolutely different points of view, it remains a contentions issue. However, the opinion that states sports facilities is the most effective way to improve public health can be easily refuted: if people do not have a will to stay healthy, sports facilities will not help. At the same time my arguments appear to be quite logical, unbiased and fair.

Some experts think that opening factories of worldwide brands is leading to a higher taxes income to a governmental budget. And it also helps to give a job work place to unemployed part of the society, which would also increase budget of state. Moreover producing in developing areas is quite cheaper than in developed ones, wich means that prices all over the world will be low. However, besides advantages mentioned above there are some contr view about this issue. even if local people are employed in international companies’ manufactory they get very low salaries. Also sometimes they have an unlimited working day or bad working conditions, high temperature or gases, which may much their health. Ethnic manufactures or traditional businesses are often numped by new big “neighbours” of international companies because they are more powerful and may have some sort of contracts with loyals and states, which open not accesed to a local firms. From a general point, I think that moving business to developing countries is a good step, because a lot of people get a job. However, they still stay in a bad living conditions, which means that there are should be international rules for global firms directing how to deal and employ workers. Also world wide organizations like Greenpeace should control factories and companies should be responsible for environmental friendly production.

These copies are shared in the Internet by ordinary people who does not want to buy original discs. Should be they punished for such actions?
This issue is quite important in the modern society, where copyright does matter. Some people think that sharing music and films in the Internet without buying it is theft and individuals, that do it, should be punished with taxes and even be inprisoned. Music and films are not for free: musicians and film producers have made them for money and they put huge amounts of time and strengh into implementation their ideas. So, other people must respect a great work of artists, musitians and the whole industries and spend money on goods, such films and music, instead of stealing and sharing it for free.
However, other people discuss this perspective and say that if we have such a great opportunity to listen to music and watching films via the Internet absolutely for free, so why we have to pay for it. They consider that these peases of art belong not only for producers and artists but for people in common. For example, when great musicians wrote their music, they got money from it but also spreded it among ordinary people. So, many people could get to know the musician. Furthermore, spreading music or films for free around the world could bring a huge population to the artist.
To sum up, the personal work should be copyrighted. Personally, I agree that people who shared music and films should be punished somehow, but not very strict, as not many users of the Internet are aware of copyright existence and they are used to gain all the things, like films and music, in the Internet without paying any sums of money.

The most sharp changes have happened in South Asia, with number of  girls and boys without access to school decreased roughly 4 and 2 times correspondingly, while other regions have shown less impressive results. In comparison, in Africa, where ere nearly as many boys without primary education as in South Asia, whereas the number of girls was almost double that in South Asia, access to primary Schools have receivied 11 millions of children, which is about one – fourth of all.

There are some reasons for such awful fact.
First of all, there is a quick development of different kinds of cruel computer games. Using of them lead to cruelty in the minds of teenagers. Some boys become crazy about killing in the virtual world. Unfortunately, some of them bring this passion to the real life. The second reason in my opinion is a wide using of Internet by kids. There are some rude advertisment there which also has some influence on the child's mind. The third one is a lack of control by parents, sisters, brothers and other relatives. In the previous times the system of looking for children was more strict. Now they have access to everything they want because of the Internet also.
Actually, there is no doubt that adults should try to make this situation better. There are some ways how to improve it. I claim that restrictions on teenager's access to the Internet will help a lot. The young people should not be able to watch cruel movies and videos also. The second way to prevent crimes by teenagers is to explain them why the last ones are gruesome. The schools have to add some lessons for that, and invite psychologists in order to speak with pupils about the damage of crimes.
To sum up, the problem of growing amount of crimes making by teenagers is very actual and is a reason for anxiety about their future. The fight with this problem is a duty of every conscious human!

Many Internet users prefer to have a free access to mediafiles. Today it shapes the agenda in governmental structures and politicians and lawers discuss confentious issue about some restrictions and punishments for illegal users of media-products on the web-resources.
The protection of intellectual property is an ambitious aim of post modern state. Because of increasing amounts of new technologies pirates have broad opportunities to share official production by free pirate copies on the Internet. Few years ago it was harder to find pirates and users of their illegal production. However, today the protection of intellectual rights is connected with access to IP-addresses of users. Producers of copies are banned by Internet-providers in many countries. However, the methods of restriction of users activities undermine their freedom of access to information. Some people are punished because they realize their rights connected with basic freedoms. So, the punishments that protect intellectual rights stay against the basic right of free access to information. Furthermore, producers of pirate copies should be found and identified, because they provide risks either intellectual property of oficial media-companies and artists, or Internet users, who use free information because of their basic right. These pirates undermine financial balance of intellectual right’s owners. Moreover, the users of copies, who share pirate information and not only use it, become pirates themselves. However, simple users of downloaded copyfiles should have undermined access to information on the Internet. Laws and provided punishments should be used by officials against producers of pirate files.
Inspite of cost of official producers of media-content, the government can do restrictions only on products of pirate information and not on users. In addition, government is able to find punishments and methods of pirate’s identification in the future.

The world is a cruel place and it have never had mercy for anyone. People commite crimes due an enormous anumber of causes: someone just want to survive, another one is simply greedy and the third one could be mentaly ill. No one can know for sure what forces the young to commite crimes more and more, however i have an idea.
My idea is that young people could be protesting. Today we have a lot of changes, especially in politics. People just go outside and they want to be heard by state, but often long and harsh protest are inevitable to break silence and grab attention to serious issues. Nowadays there are an abundance of the young who protsets.Recently, in Russia we had such big protests at 26 of march and there were a lot of young people. How it is related to crimes? Then you are in a group you feel safe and can do some mad deeds which are definetly crimes.This is my point of view and of course it is not the only root of evil.
What can do parents and teachers? They take a major role is socialisation of cheldren and teenagers. The best thing they can do - teach their children what is good and what is bad and actualy participate in their life.

It is considered that the happiest people are those, who have hobby. It is important to have a place, where you can enjoy free time, doing something that you are interested in. Moreover, people, who share your interests can make you feel happier. Of course, spending time with relatives and friends can also influence on person’s mood.
Moreover, some people are quick to point out that happiness depends not only hobbies and free time. People should  mind on what they are doing at work, in school or university. Large amount of stress can mamke a person angry sad. Such fillings does not make somebody happy at all.
Unfortunately, people spend too much time on thinking on unimportant problems, they do not notice that they can be happy right now. From my point of view, such people dream too much. They wait for ideal amount and do not notice that things, that could make them happy are all around: friends, family, pets, sunny day, interesting book, and many others.

I agree with opinion that people should be careful using modern technologies in their every day life. Sometimes problems with health may be rather more serious that some advantages of computers, telephones. For example, nowadays due to the mobile phones with the mobile Internet we may got an access to any kinds of information we need at any time and everywhere. This is undoubtly a great advantage for people in fast changing modern world. However, such gadgets also provides teenagers with game, social websites, which may be not only useless for them, but also harmful. By the reason of constant using of modern devices many people have headaches, can see badly and may have a lot of other deseases.
Unfortunately, people don't forsee such health problems, but just try to reduce problems, which they have already had. For example, they go to hospital, take medicine, try to limit their children in using their devices.
At the same time, modern technologies may not have any disadvantages, if people use them rationally. For example, the development of technologies in ship building help people to send and get goods and products faster and more ecologically - friendly.
In conclusion, the increasing number of health problems, caused by the using of technologies should be predicted by scientists. In addiction people should estimate their risks by themselves and reduce usage of devices if they do not really need to use them.

I somewhat agree with statement, that it is vital problem in order to solve.
I suggest, that every person wants to live in the safety environment, takes a deep breath with clear air and other, that’s why we should to do possible accomodations for its deal. Firstly, people live in a high-technical world, where we connect with different parts of the countries or continend, that’s why it isn’t very vital to fly by plane for conferences. For example, businessmen can discuss their problems with help of Skype. Moreover, this programme allows not only to speak with partner on the other side of screen, but also and see the person. I think it is very great and convient. Secondly, nowadays political position is dangerous and a lot of type of air travelling are damaged. Besides, these unrecognizable sutuations kill huge amount of human lifes. Although, I thinks this problem is solved by protection of local measures. For example, people, who have own deal or business, should to introduce or share with companies in this country, where live. This way allows to protect air atmosphere and own production, companies, fabricks. Thirdly, also we have other facilities to go to the university, between different towns, to spend leisure activities such as by train, by bus or by car. All of these are more safe  than planes, and a lot of people are frightened by a huge amount of kilometres from the ground.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, people choose, as a way of transportation, air travelling, because it is more faster. Secondly, sometimes accidents are happined by independent conditions of you, that’s why you have a little time to prevent catastrous..
In conclusion, I’d like to say, that everybody wishes to take a clear oxygen without harmful pollutions, that’s why all requirenments are needed to put in our attention, if it will br not so comfortable to us.

It is widely believed that people in poorer countries tend to work harder and to study while they work, because they are more ambitious. Moreover, this tendency will help developing countries to raise their heads and to start achieving their main goal - becoming a self-confident developed countries. Furthermore, it is possible that such moving can help these companies to expand in the future. One of the disadvantages of this fact is decreasing interest to international companies in developed countries, outwhere they came from. It can happen that because of developing business in poor countries, the situation in large developed countries might become worse, if they do not lead their affairs carefully. Another disadvantage is the situation when business in developing countries go bankrupt, but there is always such risk.

First of all, every person have to understand the position of reducing air travels. Comfortable conditions for one are harmful for all others. If they know that their quality of fly damaged planet and, in future, their lover people, family and relatives, people start to reduce air travels without laws and taxes.

I strongly believe that people care about relatives and others for do not offer comfortable conditions for themselves ones. Secondly, there are a lot of confirences, trainings, couchings and seminars for business and company development, that located in different countries, so organizations pay money for transporting workers to these evidences. If companies get used to organize the process more better.

On the other hand, reducing the amount of air travel could lead to bankrout of aero companies, tourism and series spheras will be in hozard of fall.

This essay provides the information about these health problems and the ways to reduce them. It also shows that such potential problems are not harmful for individuals if they take definite measures and actions. 

Firstly, the list of health problems caused by modern technology starts with the lack of activity. As a result, less people do exercises and sports gaining problems with heart and body. For instance, nearly 30% of all people are overweight and the majority of them is due to often  use of cars and computers. What is more, widespread use of smartphones and gadgets lead to problems with eyesight. Consequently, a great deal of people have to use gadgets on a day-to-day basis. 

However, such problems are basically appear because of wrong people’s behavior. A lot of people ignore the need of everyday exercises in order to stay healthy as they do not want to spend their time considered as valuable. There are some individuals, for example, who go to work earlier instead of morning run or fitness. The solution of this problem is to spend at least 15 minutes per day on doing exercises. In addition, it would be great to take the breaks during a use of computer or smartphone. This will allow your eyes stay healthy for a longer time. 

Taking everything into consideration, it is undoubtful that modern technology cause some problems with health. However, a rational use of them is a key for individual to stay healthy and keep fit in the modern life.

Nevertheless, nowadays many people are concerned about its impact on the environment and claim that air travelling should be restricted by introducing specific laws. However, I do not share this point of view for some reasons. First of all, the limitation of air travelling will not do that much to reduce air pollution, as it will still be used and the problem of global warming will still exist. To reach the effectiveness of these laws, the government should ban air travelling. Otherwise, the problem would not be solved and restricting the usage of planes, for instance, will not fail to contribute significantly to lowering the risk of global warming. Secondly, I disagree with the statement that lot of air travel is unnecessary. Due to the fact that planes tickets are expensive, people do not use the opportunity to buy them very often and usually prefer using trains, ships or ferries. Moreover, governmental restriction will be an interruption to the person’s right to travel freely that is not appropriate. Notwithstanding with these arguments, many people say that government should limit the usage of air travelling vehicles, as it should care about the environment and the citizens’ health condition, which can be worsened by air pollution. Nevertheless, it is debatable.

On the one hand, it is rather difficult to decrease the amount of flights because it is the fastest way of travelling. Most of the companies have to send their workers at another place by plane. For example, it is impossible to imagine how a serious businessman travels for a lot of days by train in the situation when he should join the important treaties as soon as possible. Moreover, a lot of people have no time for travelling by car or by train in another country, because the length of their vacancies is just about two weeks. On the other hand, the issues of air pollution and global warming are becoming essential nowadays. For instance, the ice is melting in Alaska, so people there already have to start searching for a place to live. A lot of factors influence our air: refrigerators in our houses, conditioners, industrial manufactures, cars, smoking and so on. That is why we should reduce the amount of them when it appears possible. Personally, I think it would be difficult for governments to invent laws reducing the number of air travel because a lot of people need it every day both for business and leisure. To sum up, it is extremely important to take care of the state of our air but it seems to be almost impossible to cut the amount of flights.

The speed of spreading of some brand new movies or music could be compared with the speed of light, especially if we talk about spreading in social net works.
On the one hand, these information leaks can be really dangerous on finances for producers. Moreover, the process of filming or recording music is very expensive. Some experts suggest that losses from pirates increasing twice annually. Ordinary people find it easier to find interesting films on the Internet than to go out and watch it on the full screen. Because of it movie producers lose their income. After all, creating movies has become a non-profit process.
On the other hand, there are a lot of more pros than cons from illegal information spreading and leaks for musicians. The main point is that: if people do not have to pay for music they want to listen to, then they will download and share it with their friends. Firstly, if they like this music, they will buy tickets for the bands sigs. or pay for officiall copies (on iTunes or CDs). All in all we see that if something is for free, more people will listen it. In this ease some musicians post their new albums or songs absolutely for free. The best example is Radiohead. They just let their fans pay as much as they want (or nothing at all) for the new album.
In conclusion, the pirate problem can be obviously stated as a controvercial one. However, it seem to me that in the nearest future all information will be accessed for free without punishing people who want to be free-riders.

I am a passionable believer into the fact that every person is a “unique hero” in the world and, consequently, it is absolutely normal that everyone has his own aspirations and beliefs. It means that a thing that makes one happy will not be suitable for another one. Therefore, it is difficult to define happiness.
Conversely, some people will disagree with my point of view. They will claim that there are some common factors that will help people to achieve happiness. For instance, love, money, successful career, family and strong health. Moreover, these factors can be disposed gradually into a human’s value system. By way of illustration, some people believe that “Love is the best thing we do” and having a loving person nearby can make millions of people to feel endless happiness. Regardless of the previously mentioned fact, a lot of people put money and career foreground.
On the contrary, there is a point of view that happiness is not something we practice: but something that comes to us when we allow it. Taking for instance, there are some people who have everything family, love, money, but they feel nervous and anxious about all those and try not to lose these qualities.
To crown it all, I suppose that the best thing to achieve happiness is to find the most important factors for yourself. For me they are love, health and friendship. So, we should try to become succesful in that way, having a positive attitude towards life.

Actually, the opinion that pirate copying should be punished is really widespread around the world. People who support that position usually provide three main arguments. Firstly, illegal copying affects the amount of money that people of art earn every day. It reduse their income so people become less motivated to work at the sphere of arts. Secondly, it is bad for the governments economies because the illegal spreading of that content cannot be taxated. Thirdly, these illegal actions can undermine the moral side of modern societies. It means that nowadays some people start to think that something “illegal” can sometimes be a good (or normal) thing. It happens because people face illegal spreading almost every day what makes it normal for them, therefore the governments want to stop pirate copying immediatly.
However, there is an opposite point of view on this issue. Some people think that every person in the world should be able to find all the content he or her needs for free. Advocates of this opinion say that some people just cannot afford buying films and music while they need it to increase their levels of culture and education.
In my opinion, every work should be rewarded so it is not fair that film producers, actors and musicians loose some part of their money because of pirate copies. However, I believe that all the educational movies and pieces of art should be free as it is important for the level of culture worldwide.

It is a big problem of current life. Humans are devided into two groups: some people think that we should make the prison sentence longer, others think that there are a various ways to solve this problem.
First of all, I should try to explain why the first group have such opinion. People believe that a long sentence in prison can be a good example for others. That other people think many times before doing a crime. Nevertheless, they don't think about people who can get into the prison by mistake. Such humans have to stay in prison for all their lifes or for a quite long sentence.
I join for the second group of opinions. I believe that there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce a crime. At first, we should realise the real causes of a crime. We should learn, behave prisoners that prevent crimes. Moreover, in my opinion, making a prison sentences longer do not solve this problem. Many people know how it is bad to be in a prison, but they still do some crime.
We should try to do people's life better to reduce the crime. It may be better to make attention on behaviour of people from the early age, from a school ot even kindergarden.
People should make the attention on the causes of the crime and try to solve the problems which push people to do some crime.
Why people, for instance, stole some products or other things? May be they have some problems with money or they have some phsihological problems, so it is better to solve such king of problems. Of course, it is may be difficult to do, but we should try. I believe that giving longer prison sentences has not got a good results.
To conclude, I believe that people in near future can create some new way to reduce crime.",70,2,2

What is more, it becomes more and more possible to watch the original films in english with or without subtitles.
In my opinion, the popularity of British and American films can be explained with economical factors. As the american and british economy are the first world economies through the last decades (or even a century), there was an opotunity to support financially local industries. Therefore, there are a lot of money spent on films and there are a lot of people, who work in the british and american film industries, which turns out to be an effective way to develop film making.
From the other side, one of the reasons for that succes is that the british and american culture has a great influence all over the world. English is a widely spoken language, it is the international language. That is why it is much more possible to spare the english and american films, to translate them. As we all know, one of the most enjoyable way to learn language of some country is to participate in its culture, to watch films, to listen to music.
That is why, in my opinion, if governments have as a goal the development of local film industries, they should spend more money on local films and look carefully that they are spent for the good reasons
To conclude, I would say that we should inspire people in our country to create better films, we should show our interest in quality of the product.",55,2,0

It is fast, comfortable and now it is getting cheaper due to the increasing number of so-called ""low-coaster"" airlines. However, there are those, who are concerned with air travel's inevitable harm to the ecology and therefore the amount of those who use this way of travelling should be reduced.
In my opinion, the problem of pollution caused by airplanes is an important and underestimated one. The advantages of the air travel are obvious for people, but this disadvantage does not concern them a lot, although the airplanes are one of the most dangerous transport for ecology. Airplanes produce a lot of harmful polluting gases such as carbon dioxide, which leads not only to the air pollution, but also to causing the global warming effect. Consequently, it would be great if governments will stop the spreading of air transport.
The problem is, however, that all the alternative ways of travelling or transportion different things are even worse. For instance, there are different ships, for passengers and for transportation of goods. What makes them worse is the fact that they require more time to move from, for example, Australia to Europe. And in the same moment they require aproximately the same amount of fuel (or even more) as planes. So the pollution to the ecology caused by them would be as big as planes'. What is more, there is almost no another way of moving from one continent to the other, and trains, or cars, or trucks, if there will be more of them on some continent because of reduced amount of airplanes, will paralyse the traffic system, to say nothing about the harm it will cause to the ecology.
However, there are some attempts to change the situation. For example, I heard of projects of an airplane which is powered by electricity. It still, as I understand, pollutes the air (the electricity does not come from nothing, unfortunately), but less then the fuel-powered airplanes.Thus, someday there may be an opportunity to stop (or, at least, pause) the pollution of the environment.",60,2,3

There are a lot of different methods to make this dream come true. One people say that in order to solve such problem sports facilities should be improved. Others suggest that it is not enough.


On the one hand, if government will biuld new sport field, new training clubs it, of course, will help. First of all, because young people will have a place where they can go to spend their own free time. They won't go to bars or clubs and drink alcochol, smoke or take drugs here. Secondly, how people want to develop health way of living without providing sports facilities and equipments? It is impossible.


On the other hand, other people believe that doing only this action will have a little results at all. I totally agree with them. Government can't achive the aim of health generation without using a mass media. Nowadays, TV, newspapers and internet take significant part in person's life. Society will have a chance to make health way of living attractive by using mass media. Moreover, such way of living should be taken into account in schools and universities. It is very difficalt and hard work to rebiuld the mind of adults, so it should be done with young population, when children just learn what they should do, what is good or bad.


To sum up the information, I would like to say that new sports facilities are very important, if we want to biuld a health society, but we shouldn't stop on this action. Parents have to show to yound people how they should live on their own example. Only in this way government and all society will have perfect results.

Undergrounds in Paris, Tokyo and Washington DC started to work one after another in 1900, 1927, and 1976 respectively.the number of kilometres of route in these cities ranged in the same order as a date of opened, from the longer one in Paris (199 km).

People of different age have to spent a lot of time in front of the computers or iPhones. This does not allow their eyes to move often enough to se well, because the eyes use to see information only nearby, but not in the distance.

In my opinion, I will look at both points of view and give my own opinion. It is a well-known fact that we use social media suc has Facebook and Vkontakte to learn something new about the world and our country. For example, every evening I flick through the site Vkontakte to get new information about my native city, its events and watch new photos of it. However, I cannot ignore the fact, that the information in such social media is not always correct and it should be always checked on the other sites. as an example, some articles in Vkontakte and Facebook include numbers that are not quite right. It is so, because everybody can post everything and nobody proof read the information you give. As for another point of view, social media can become an excellent way to relax and spend your time. For instance, there are a lot of amazing videos and films in sites like Vkontakte and Facebook, you can download and enjoy. Nevertheless, it is not the main purpose of social media. To my mind, it is more used for communication and sharing your impressins with friends and relatives who can be far from you. As for me, now I leave in Moscow and all my family stay in Samara. And to maintain our relations we communicate a lot in social media like Vkontakte. All in all, social media is widely used among people of different ages. Ones use it to share information, others prefer to relax and distract from reality with these sites. Personally I think that only the combination of all the functions have made social media so popular.

It can be music or dance performance, drawing pictures or it can be even simple words which show your feelings. During centures people learnt to express themselves somehow and present days are not an exception.
	Some people think that it is illegal to do what person wants and where he wants, because there are some laws and moral rules which should stop people doing strange things on the public. The aim of performers is to attract the audience attention and sometimes they break all rules and do amoral things, which can shock other people. The main solution of such problem is government restrictions. Only when people are afraid of doing crazy things they will not do it.
	On the other hand there is another opinion. Some people think that people should be allowed to express themselves because all people have freedom and can do everything to say something to the world, but it depends on the way they show their thoughts and feelings. There are different beautiful things people can do to make this world brighter. For example street art or street music, it is always followed by positive reaction, makes people’s mood better. If noone express themselves we will never know about creative and talanted artists, singers, musicians, writers, actors. The world then will be boring and grey.
	From my opinion people should express their emotions but they must notice the borders and know the main rules, especially moral rules. Because sometimes people do strange creepy things which shocked publicity.
	Generally speaking, government should make some rules for people who want to be noticed by doing creative things, only then there will not be different awfull accidents.

People do not need to go to the cinema to watch the new film and it is unnecessarily to buy tickets to another country just to listen to your favourite musician. Copies started spreading by the Net very quickly. Some people think that those one who download these copies, should be punished, because it’s a theft. This essay disagrees that opinion, and there are some reasons below.
Firstly, the aspect of the opportunity to buy the original discs depends on the country. Some music or film discs are not delievered in certain countries. For Example, in Russia it could be hard to find some original copies of new albums or films, hence, the only way for the huge fans to listen to their favourite musician or to watch the film is to find the pirate copies on the Net.
Moreover, music, films and other forms of art should be available to anyone. The opportunity of knowing art should not depend on the amount of money which certain person owns and other does not. In my opinion, there could be a measure to definite who is a real pirate, commiting theft, and who just has no other way to enjoy music and films.
To sum up, I want to say that there is no certain definition for the pirates. It could not be denied that artists, musicians and film makers lose their money, but we can not define such kind of theft in one way. Some measures should be taken not to make the situation even worse.

To begin with, different gizmos are very popular and people usually tend to take them everywhere they go. Gadjets give off radience, causes cancer. Cancer is a huge problem and is difficult to cure because we always surrounded with all these technological things. What is more, if a person is always concentrated on screen of his/her phone, eyes suffer, eyesight becomes much weaker. There are millions  of people who were glasses, especially office workers as they need to spend a lot of time in front of computers. Furthermore, social networks are one of the major part of daily life. People always surf the Internet. There are always upcoming messages. For instance, signals from phone can distract from life and work very easily. People spend hours on them and then they are late with their projects and work. Thus, modern technologies can lead to stress and panic attacks. People become too nervous. 

There are some ways to anticipate these problems and mitigate the damaging effect of modern gadjets. Firstly, people should spend less time on computer entertainment as this is just a waste of time which, unfortunately, can lead to unhealthy mind and body. It is more important to concentrate of real life, than on-line one. Secondly, it is crucial take some breaks during the work and do some exercizes to give some rest to eys and body at whole. This will also reduce the evidence of gaining excess fat. Thirdly, the better way to minimaze the radiance level in one’s apartment is to decrease the number of gadjetc in house.


To concluded, modern technologies are a very useful source to society and world development but they can also cause some terrifying diseases. To tackle such problems, it is significant not to overuse gadjets, be more active and spend more time outside buidings which are fill of computers, wi-fi routers.

One point of view discuss about the private privelage and personal creution. For authors, whose plays are stolen, would be better to compensate this illegale process. Undoubteadly the government will spend a huge amount of money for that spends. But the justice for authors cost more. For instance, if someone steel a new album of favourite band it should be present as a purchase for authors. That would be great for both sides: band will be sure that if something goes wrong government will compensate some administration could catch thiefs and arrest them.
On the other hand is law which will arrest all illegal downloads in particular coutry. For example, if government catch one thief and arrested him for two weeks, all another pirates will see the results of this illegal sharing. In that cuse many pirates could stop thiefing and start interesting what ever they want. Also, the administration could start banning all illegal sites. That would be much more useful in that situation. Thiefs couldn’t share their files and band won’t punish anyone.

Many users of these social networks share information and knowledge through sending links or downloading the important news. However, sometimes the information given to us can be falsified. Lots of spam and pop-up pages disturb users from reading the information they need. Users need to pay attention to what they read and to whom they share knowledge. Of course, there are not only drawbacks of sharing information and knowledge in Facebook or VK. Getting the information becomes much easier. Users can upload their essays or homeworks and post them on the wall, so their friends will be able to check it and help. Many newspapers have official pages, where they post hotnews. It enables users, who are subscribed, to be the first who read the news. Although, Facebook and Vkontakte have lots of information for sending, it also has entertaining content, such as music, films and games. This content gives a chance to users to spend time playing games with your friends or watching new film with family. However, the majority of music and films, uploaded to these web-sites are usually pirate. This means that it’s illegal to use the entertaining content due to authority rights. The social network Vkontakte was sued for “pirate” music and films and asked to pay 14 million dollars to singers or producers. In conclusion, I should mention that both of these purposes have advantages and disadvantages therefore, it’s important to pay attention to what you read or listen on social media web-sites.

One of the modern business trends is a relocation of international companies to developing countries all over the world and an employment of local workers. This process has both advantages and disadvantages. To begin with, there are a lot of benefits when international companies move and appear in poor countries. Firstly, this fact improves infrastructure. In other worlds new roads, buildings and other facilities are created because of international companies. The next reason why it is a good idea to move international companies in these countries is that developing countries start to develop faster. It means that new ideas and technologies of international companies help to make living in these countries better. According to one Russian social research, the developing countries where a lot of international companies were moved solve many social political and economic issues and their development became faster. However, there are some disadvantages of this process. One of them is a bad condition of work in poorer countries. For instance, it is very hard to make business in Tunasia because there are a lot of deserts, a lack of nature and other factors in this area. In addition, a lot of people in developing countries do not have special education. in other words, it is very hard to employ local workers and find persons who graduated from universities. For example, the level of illiteracy in Tunasia is one of the highest in the world and businessmen do not want to move their companies to this developing country. Nowadays, it is very trendy to move huge international companies to developing countries all over the world and employ poor local people there. The main benefit of this process is that these companies create a new infrastructure. The main disadvantage is that nobody want to move a business to a country with bad working conditions. However, it seems to me that the advantages of this improvement or development outweigh the disadvantages and it is a very good idea to move business to poorer countries and employ local people.

According to this fact, we can make a conclusion, that Yemen hadn’t demographic problems in the beginning of the 21th century. There are only 3,6 percent of old people in Yemen, and their number won’t be much bigger. In 2050, the number of middle-aged people will rose, and will be approximately 60%. The other situation can be noticed in Italy. Unlike Yemen, this country has strange demografic problems. The small number of children in 2000 years will decrease and will be only 11,5% in 2050. Also, the number of old people, that was about a quater of all population, will rose and should be 42,3%. I think, Italian government should do something to solve this problem.

Some people persist on the decrease in air travels for a lot of them are just for pleasure. By setting some new laws. I completely disagree with this idea and try to explain the reasons for this.

firstly, I want to speak about pollution in general. Nowadays almost all manufactures pollute the nature. They split spoiled gas into the atmosphere, put waste into rivers and soil. Different tipes of gas used every day enlarge the ozon gap which lead to global warming. So the air travel is hot of primary importance to take measures on. Because the harm from it is really miserable compared to others.

Secondly, people are free to go to wherever they want to. This right is laid in the basic human rights. No law could restrict people from travelling wheather it is a business matter or just for leisure one. The only thing the government could and thould do is to recommend to chose alternative means of transportation. Moreover, it is a great question if this alternatives would pollute the air less than airplanes.

In conclusion, the air travel should not be reduced by the law because it controverse the law itself. the governments could plan to fund the budget into the finding of solution to this problem. By enventing a new mean of transport which spoils the environment less. But today the situation is that there is no fast and convinient substitude for air travelling.

A closer look to the data helps one find out that the patterns of percentage use of Facebook and Instagram are quite similar. We can notice that the younger the group is, the higher the share of Facebook and Instagram users among this group is. Thus, there are 87% young people from 18 to 29 using Facebook, while only 56% of old people over 65 years use Facebook. As for Instagram, the discrepancy between the percentage use of this network by young and old people is even more significant. The share of young users is about 9 times higher that the one for the oldest group.

GOVERMENT AND PARENTS TRY TO COME UP WITH AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION AND PREVENT CRIMES AND DECREASE THEIR LEVEL TO THE MINIMUM, BUT THE BEST WAY WAS NOT FOUND YET. THIS ESSAY TRIES TO FIND OUT THE SOLUTION AND UNCOVER THE TRUE CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IN TODAYS WORLD.

FIRST OF ALL, CHILDREN ARE AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE SHOWN IN TV SERIAS OR FILMS, THEY ARE EASILY INFLUNCED BY CHARISMATIC VILLIANS AND TRY TO MIMIC THEM. THE STATISTICS TELLS THAT MORE THAN 50 PER CENT OF CRIMES IS COMMITED JUST BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE TO FEEL SOMETING NEW OR BE MORE POWERFUL. IT CAN BE SOLVED SIMPLY. FOR INSTANCE, PARENTS AND TEACHERS SHOULD TRY TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT A CHILD WATCHS AND TALK TO HIM OR HER ABOUT IT OR JUST DO NOT LET WATCH TV. IT IS BETTER TO SPEND TIME IN THE MUSEUM OR THE NEAREST PARK. OF COURSE, IT IS NOT SO MUCH, BUT IT IS A GOOD START.

SECONDLY, ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CAUSES HERE IS CRIMINAL SITUATION IN THE TOWN OR ON YOUR STREET. IT MUST BE PREVENTED THAT CHILDREN CAN HAVE AN OPPURTUNITY TO SOCIALIZE IN SUCH PLACES. THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY NOT ONLY FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS BUT FOR THE GOVERMENT TOO IS GENTRIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE USA NUMBER OF GETTOS WERE REBUILT, SO THE LEVEL OF CHILDREN/S CRIMES WENT DOWN. MOREOVER, ACTIVE CITIZENS ORGANIZED LOTS OF ACTIVITIES AND CLACCES FOR THE KIDS WITH PROBLEMS.

HOWEVER, CAUSE OF MIND PROBLEMS EXISTS AND AFFECTS THE STATISTICS. ACCORDING TO THE DATA, IF MENTAL DESEASES WERE FOUND ON THE FIRST STAGES IN CHILDHOOD, WE WOULD PREVENT MUCH MORE CRIMES IN AGE OF 16-21. PARENTS AND TEACHERS HAVE TO WORK TIGHTLY WITH PSYCOLOGISTS TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM AND HELP A CHILD. AS IT CAN BE SEEN, TEENAGERS ARE RESERVED, AND ONLY GOOD SPECIALIST CAN PROVIDE APPROPRIATE HELP TO PREVENT CRIMES OR EVEN SUICIDE IN THE FUTURE.

OVERALL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT CAN BE WAYS THAT WERE PROMOTED BY ME OR SOME GOVERMENT PROJECT, BUT ALL IN ALL, PROBLEM MUST BE SOLVED, BECAUSE THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS OUR FUTURE AND NOW IT IS NOT SO TRUSTFUL AS SOCIETY WANTS TO SEE IT.",65,2,0

Nowadays it is believed, that crime is done by young generation, not by elder people.
Firstly, I would like to mention that today rather big amount of young people do not study as well, they have no motivation to study, to learn something new and by this way the are not able to find yourself. As a result, it becomes necessity to get more by the easiest way. For instance, they can do burgling, pickpocketing and other bad things.
It is needed to be controlled in proper way. For example, some parents ARE the source of this problem. What is the worst that they do not grow their children up in proper way, they can not control them. Children always need some attention, even the smallest. They need it so much that they can behave like this to get some attention from their parents a bit .Moreover, the teachers should motivate the youth, make children to hear them, because teachers are mentors! I strongly believe, that attitude and relationships between teachers and pupils should be changed, particularly in Russia. Teachers in Russia are accept as a minor, that is why pupils are afraid of them and even can not talk about something after school time. Furthermore, the youth behave this way because of lack of some interests. It means, that they should find something that will give them positive feelings, something that can unburden the interest. I do believe, that sport can solve this problem, because when you do this you are focused only on this deal and can relax and get rid of bad things from your mind.
To sum up, I would like to add, that actually all these bad things depend on a person. Some people have strong spirit, the feeling of honesty and they fight with it well.",60,2,2

Why conquering new areas can be much more easier and do the local workers are less demanding in a sense of salary and working conditions than the euporean ones?And what are the disadvantages? First of all , I'd like to emphasise the fact that more and more foreingers from developing countries try to move to Europe in order to be payed and treated better than in their own countries.This fact shows that there are still a vast amount of people working under the same conditions that the others who have already moved anywhere used to work.This means that big companies are surely aware of the fact too, so in order to make the production much more cheaper they move their headquarters to the poorer countries.Also developing countries boast of their people's stamina and hard-work so it is quite tempting to get a great workers and lessen the expenses. Secondly, mastering new territories give a great opportunities to develop not only existing industries but creating the new ones.Developing countries are full of fossils and natural resources which haven't been touched by humans before ,so the nature and the good old technology of the developed countries may combine for the better results.Thirdly these areas exclude rivalry between big companies so they can work freely- there are much less big companies in there. Thirdly, the legislations are quite different so in some countries it is much more easily to do something which is strictly forbidden in any other and the majority of workers are surely not aware of their rights so it is easier for companies to manipulate due to poor education level.Anyway I am mot a professional in the field but watching so many documentaries on the net I must confess that sometimes I see big companies as a monstrous machines enslaving people in developing countries.It is heart-breakingly sad seeing them coping with famine and surviving as the companies are vasting and thriving on them all the time. Unfortunately, I do not comprehend the laws of business and stuff so I am just be satisfied with the fact that companies give people more workplaces becuase unemployment is the great problem of the whole world, not talking about the developing countries.            ",65,2,1

Factories and plants of world famous brands are located mostly in developing countries. It is common thing today, which is wildly discussed in the society. In my essay different pros and cons of such policy will be considered. First of all, the reasons of why big companies decide to develop their business somewhere abroad are quite simple. The main reason is money. Cheap labour force allows companies to get higher income from the production of their goods. Moreover, labour legistation is not so strickt like in Europe or in the US for example. Nobody is going to check the conditions, amount of salary people get and so on. Secondly, it helps to develop local infrastructure. Addidas company in India build not only factories but also schools for children of workers, hospitals provided the region facilities they haven’t had before. Moreover, it is much more expensive to built a factory somewhere in Europe because of shortage of place and also because of higher taxes. On the other hand, there are several disadvantages. Very often people need to work in a very severe conditionals and get small money just because they have not any choice. In addition, companies usually don’t check amount of air pollution (or water one). It leads to environmental problems, and, as a result, to the health diseases. The case of China is world famous. The concentration of carbon emissions is too high to breath, people, especially children, suffer because of it very much. All in all, in my opinion, for some countries it is a good opportunit to attract foreign companies and make them invest money in local economy building factories and providing people work places. We shouldn’t concentrate all over business in one region, we should broaden and develop all over the world. I believe that to more businesses to poorer developing countries is a normal sensible measure. But we shouldn’t forget about ecological issue and workers circumstances.

Some humans believe that sportsmen, who take drugs should be banned for a certain period, whereas the others think that they should be banned forever. This essay will disscuss both points of view surrounded this issue.
On the one hand, the ban for a limited period gives a chance for an athlete to continue his career. This limit provides a time for a sportsman to rethink what he did and prepare to next competitions. The main point of it is that these sportsmen should always be under control of Organisation of drug control. For example, there was a scandal on the Olympic Games in Rio about drugs and some athletes were banned. They could not compete there, however, they will be participate in next Olympic Games, so it is their chance to present their country again.
On the other hand, banning for the rest of sportsmen's lives can be cause of their psychological problems Athlete can not live without competitions, he needs to use his skill with his opponents. Besides, athlete loses his fans and this can have a negative impact on their psychological health. In addition, the country loses the valuable sportsman, who can compete and bring high results and gives a country respect from other states.
To conclude, the banning of sportsmen because of their drugs-taking is a strong punishment, however from my point of view it should be temporary as denying for the rest of their lives causes many negative outcomes both for athlete and his country.

The US print market has the highest revenue in 2014 in comparison with other countries. Also, the US eBook market will face a significant growth in 2018. It will increase from 5 to 8,5 billion dollars. There are some general trends in the development of the book market in the USA, Germany, China and the UK. The eBook market in all these countries will increase steadily from 2014 to 2018. On the contrary, the print market of these countries will decrease. Apart from that, the print market in Germany shows the same result in both 2014 and 2018.
Overall, the development of the book market in all mentioned countries will face several issues between 2014 and 2018.

Some people say that sports and physical education are the ultimate way to improve nation`s health, other believe there are more important things. So, will building sports facilities have desired effect on health?
Firstly, obviosly, our health does depend on our lifestyle. It depends on whether or not we go for a morning jog, or how many times a week do we exercise. And in big cities it is difficult to find time to go to the gym, especially if it is on the other side of the town. So, if we build more gyms, stadiums and strategically locate them in the most convenient places, more people will spend time on improving their bodies and keeping themselves fit. It will have a positive effect on their health and may inspire others to do the same.
But, if we look from another perspective, it is obvious that we have to spend a lot of money on facilities without getting immediate result. And it might be a better short-term decision to spend more money on other programs, such as healthy eating or medical care. 
Public health is very important. And, of course, we have to invest in it. But, in my opinion, while sports is one of the main health factors, it is not the only one, so we shouldn`t focus on only one task, but distribute financing evenly between several measures.

On the one hand it is evident why this opinion appeared. People who support it think that, fistly, the longer the prison sentence is, the more people fear to get into prison, and secondly, there will be less criminals on the streets, as most of them will be in prisons for long (or forever).

On the other hand increasing the length of prison sentences has some disadvantages.To begin with,'longer' compaired to what standard? Every country has its own, and those countries which have the longest prison sentences do not suffer least from the crimes. After that, where to keep all the criminals, what would they eat? Of course, taxes rise automatically, which will lead to a wave of protest in the society. Then, a criminal society is formed in prisons, the longer one stays there, the more of a criminal one becomes. Let us take an example of a crime story, a boy decided to record a movie in the cinema and post it on the internet. After the reform, which makes ALL the prison sentences longer, he might remain in prison not for a couple of years, but for the whole decade. What kind of a person is he going to be after going out? If we increase the penalties only for certain crimes, then how should we choose which ones? So, we can see, that there is a lot to think through in this law.

It should be stated that there are other ways to reduce crimes. I believe, that the government could make all the prisoners work and thus make prisons profitable. Doing so will not only give some money to the governmental budget, but also give criminals a profession. There may even be a practice of giving the former prisoners work on the factories.

To sum up, prison sentences should be increased with caution, moreover, in my opinion, other measures should better be taken to reduce crime.",70,2,2

In my opinion, we face an increasing number of crimes committed by the youth due to lack of communication between parents and their children and the increasing popularity of online social networks. I believe only more effort to cooperate and communicate with young people can be a way to solve the problem.
Nowadays, the problem is that parents lack interpersonal communication with their children. Families spend less and less time together and that is the reason why young people may fail to obtain valuable moral principles and learn to understand the difference between “good” and “bad”. Moreover, the youth tend to spend more time communicating online, where it is much easier to face an example of abnormal behavior and violance. Lack of interaction in real life is substituted with more online communication and this may lead to gaining social norms which are represented in the Internet. But nowadays, there is not control after online social norms, which implies that their quality is quite unpredictable and usually, in fact, quite low.
As a lack of communication is the reason for quite low moral principles of the young, I believe only more interpersonal relations in real life can make a difference. Schools and parents should do their best to communicate more with the young. More cooperation will allow adults to chare their principles with the young and help them to avoid adopting abnormal behavior which they may face online or even in real life. However, it’s important not to restrict the young from using any sources of communication which may seem harmful. It is much more effective to educate young adults why some models of behavior may be impropper.
All in all, I believe, the key reason of the increased number of crimes, committed by young people is lack of real-life interaction whcih leads which leads to low social norms that young people adopt. The main remedy from that is more effort to cooperate with the young and let them know what the “good” and proper behavior is.

On the one hand, musicians and film producers fail to recieve the money that they should actually pet after their creations were released. What is more, such things are usually posted in poor equality, thus people who listen to or watch them can not realise, what great job was done to create it. They will not be able to face the effects the producers use in their films, understand, how wonderful is the sound in the songs.
Moreover, if we speak about official buying in iTunes, for instance, it also helps the owners of such platforms to pet money. What is more, due to copies more people in the whole world will know about the stuff and its producers. This is the way for them to become even more popular.
On the other hand, after watching the film or listening to music on the internet a person may deside to go to the cinema or buy the song or even the whole album if he or she liked it indeed. The fact is that if someone knows that really good things were produced and is sure that things really go this way, the creators will recieve even much money.
All in all, it seems that the producers lose too much money because of copying as at is thought. The spread of their creativity may make them very famous and rich indeed. If a person is popular with things he or she does that will anable to produce more new extraordinary films and songs. Finally, it seems that there is no serious reason for trying to prevent copying.

To begin with, this movement can help a developing country to improve its economic by selling companies' products. In addition,  a poor country can borrow new ideas or technologies produced by the company, that means it can get a status of a developed country. Moreover, international companies can employ local workers and it may lead to reduced unemployment and to increased number of work places which is also significant for developing.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, there is an opposite statement. Firstly, many local workers would prefer to work in an international company rather than in their countries' developing companies, so other companies might have no people to employ. Secondly, a developing country might borrow international companies' ideas and it means that it may have no own ideas that is actually bad for developing. Thirdly, it is more significant for all countries to create their own companies and to try to make them international, but because of the movement of other countries' companies it might have no sense so it can stop the developing process.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, this problem has both advantages and disadvantages.

If the government or private organization built, for example, a swimming pool in small town, the population of this town will do more sport and it let them to be healthier.


On the other hand, the increase of the number of sport facilities is not enough to improve public health. It is important to develope other measures too. First of all, people should change their mind about their diet. The number of people, who really want to be fit and try to have healthier diet is too low. Thousands of people eat fast food or other fat food everyday. McDonald's, KFC and other fastfood companies advertise their production everywhere : on TV and Internet, on busstops and builboards. Moreover, this companies try to attract children by organizing special events.


From my point of view, the governments should provide the politics which combine all view of people.

The main arguments for the first opinion are the following. Firstly, it is cheaper and easier not to threat the illness but to stop it from evolving. Better health means better immune system means less illness. Without a doubt person is more likely to use a sport centre if it is within a walking distance from his/her home. So more sport facilities lead to stronger health. Secondly, person who uses gym regularly tends to pay more attention to his eating habbits and day routine. If anything even running exercises are far less difficulte for non-smoker. This means that availability of sports centres can have a positive effect on people's avareness of their health.


Nevertheless more must be done for public health. Often even when person cares about his/her health he/she has no opportunity to buy healthy food, because the information on the products is unreliable or even non-existing or this kinds of products are too expensive. This example illistrates that increasing the number of sport facilities should go alongside with other measures. Moreover, when person gets sick, the needed medical threatment must be provided, so he/she must be covered with insurance of some kind, sport centres will be useless in this case.

Sometimes he just close his hands behind his back in a ring and dodges all the punches without the help of the hands. Secondly, people who don’t believe in this. Of course, we study a lot during our life time and it causes some effect, for sure. But you know what? This is too big argument, and even a million essays on this topic won’t put a daught in it.

There can be many points of view at that problem and different countries choose different methods to reduce crime.
One way of solving the problem is violence as the answer to violence. There can be prison sentences that longs decades or laws that give opportunity to kill some of the criminals. People who prefere that way believe that it can scare potetial criminals so they would be forced to find other way to live than breaking the law. Moreover, this way prooved its successfullness by decades and centuries of using force to make criminals away from other people.
The second way of reducing the level of crimes is created to solve the main reason of most of all crimes - the lack of money. There is not a secret that many people live hard and cruel life but some of them have not even opportunity to change it. The people that do not accept long prison sentences believe that laws that protect groups of people who can not protect themselves, helping to thouse who needs help and the chance to live better life, could increase the global level of education and level of life. More than that, these people propose to help the criminals to solve they problems and make them feel really sorry for the things that they have done to their victims and pay for it. It would also reduce level of crime just because there would not be thouse who does not see other way to solve their problems.
In my opinion both methods have their problems such as riscs of mistakes of the first way and difficulty of the second.To tell the truth, the first way seems enough right because it provides the opportunity of revenge for the victims of criminals, while the second way may seem too soft and not effective. To make a conclusion, I think that second way is more effective during the long time and it should reconstruct all the society to achieve its goal, but it is the thing that should have been done to defend everyone and to rise the society at the next level of evolution of relationships between humans.",70,2,1

One of the most important factors that constitute a future professional 'profile' of every individual is, of course, higher education. Providing society with strictly similar numbers of male and female graduates in each subject would certainly change the labour market as well as academic world. But will these changes be for the better - or for the worse?
The first point to fear in mind is that nowadays students are accepted on the basis of their performance during entrance examinations. That means: only previous qualifications and / or knowledge of each applicant is taken into consideration. Is it fair to give preferences to this or that young person because of their race, religion or gender? No, this will mean discrimination , and that is the inevitable consequence of 'gender-based' intake of students.
Extremely alike reform has been carried out in Germany. The universities are obliged to hold different entrance lists for man and women with different entrance marks. As a result, it may be easier for a male to gain acceptance to a medical school (with 1.3 entrance mark in comparison with female 1.1). I do not think that is 'fairness' in the proper sense of this word.
The only aspiration of this reform I agree with is the feeling that certain fields of science or work are traditionally 'male' or 'female'. Although I don't believe that 'maxing' of sexes should be caused by such a radical method , I think that young girls and boys should be encouraged to take up any profession they are into, no matter if it is supposed to be men- or women-only occupation.

This essay will fist discuss the reasons for this trend and secondly outline the most important actions that family and teachers can do in case to prevent the future growth of the number of young criminals.

Fistly, we can easily identife the problems in a social sphere of the country by the number of young people who commited a crime. It goes without saying that sometimes the only reason for such illegal actions is poverty. Experiencing a lack of money, suffering from hunger and health problems the person will be trying to improve his or her life, and sometimes it means commiting a crime. The best example is the sutiation in suburb of Moscow, where the young boy, who wanted to eat, stole some money from the old lady. The number of young criminals can not become lower without the support of the social programms.

Secondly, parents and teachers can affect the situation and save young person from performing some danerous actions, as commiting a crime is. Teachers should pay attention to the every child in his or her class in case to recognise the problem in child's lifes and try to solve it with a help of psychologists. Parent should be patien and create a warm athmosphere in a family, because i support the idea, that when your family loves and understands you there is no need to do something illegal to gain money or your popularity among the classmates.

To sum up, i think that the main reason for commiting a crime for young people is lack of money, and to prevent the growth of this trend we should take care of them in families and pay a lot of attention at schools. What is more, some social support from the goverment will be beneficial too.",70,2,1

There are several opinions on this matter. Some people think, that athlets should be banned from competitions for a limited period, while others think, that this punishment should endure for the rest of their lives.
The first ones, those who mention a limited period, certainly have some solid ground arguments. Of course, as humanity develops, develops sport industry as well. New sport equipment, new training methods can sometimes allow even things that may have been called a miracle the last century. And, no doubt, it's becoming more difficult to achieve new records. This provides illegal drugs usage. And it is very difficult, perhaps, even impossible to determine, whether it was a sportsman's desire, or a government pressing. It is indeed rather strange thing, but archaical wish to show country's musculinum, glory and power even throw sport competition still lives! So, often, it may indeed be not a desire of sportsmen to use illegal drugs, but opression by the government forces.
Others, evidently, do not assume that it is possible and demand wronged sportsmen to be banned for the rest of their lives. This point of view may be understanded. Because unfairness is indeed a sad problem. And it should be punished.
But from my point of view, there can not be a simple yes or no decision. Every crime is unique. And as I mentioned afterwards of some powerfull structures interference.
To conclude, I would like to underline one more time emphasis of principle, that every evidence is unique and should be judged very carefully.

Besides the enormous number of benefits, provided with that fact, there are still some drawbacks. The one is airplanes wastes, that pollute atmosphere and cause global warming.
One should not forget, that there are literally dozens of thousands of airplanes, which lift up and set down all over the world daily. Each of them burns fuel and therefore contributes wastes into the atmosphere. While being not heavy than air, these gases flow up and within tome being may cause Earth ozon shield destruction. That is why I strongly agree, that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of wastes, but not the amount of air travel itself.
To my mind, the general restriction in number of air flights would not affect anything, but the flight price, which is not the ultimate goal. Nowadays, air flights is a necessity and by reducing its number government will only increase the demand and therefore its price.
It goes without a doubt, that the reduction of amount of waste itself will solve the problem. So there are basically two ways to make it work: air flights number reduction and innovative ecologically friendly fuel. The first one is not the option as it has just been concluded. That is why I believe that innovative fuel is the future of air travel. For instance, the air plane, flying on solar energy, is now being tested. Of course, that kind of plane does not pollute air anyhow.
To sum up, I do agree with a general point, that airplanes pollute air too much and the global warming is inevitable in this case. But at the same time I disagree with the measures, which are suggested.

Modern Universities offer a wide range of subjects in order to fealize young people's right to get higher education. No one can permit and make someone to choose faculty they don't want just because you are boy or girl. What is more, the government trough the universities can not control an amount of people of each gender, studying definite subject.
It's widely agreed that there are a lot of professions which are typical for only males or females. For instance, You can meet  male-nurse or male baby-sitter in the kindergarden - rather seldom. Moreover, some professions require ""cold mind"" and an ability to analize. I suppose, this is the strong point of males. So it could be unfair to accept equal numbers of male and female to study enjineering or programming. To my mind, it's not a gender discrimination. This caused by desire to get the best and the most qualified specialists.
From any point of view it seems to be discrimination to limit percentage of people of both 2 genders. If only 3 girls cuant to learn cybernetics down to 3 person.
It should be taken into qecunt that the situation when equal amount of girls and boys study one subject, what is the main issue, can never come true as it is impossible for state to regulate people's interests. It will be vivid violence of constitutional rights.

Moreover, the illegal actions may be done by youngsters. What make them behaive this way? I this essay, I will highlight some causes and suggest possible ways how to solve them.

Firstly, it can be highlited that not every child has the same opportunities as his/her peers. If one classmate has the new phone, his friends will also interested in it. But not everyone has enough money to buy. That is the reason of stealing the phone from the shop or from another man. The possible solution of this problem may be the creating of equality in schools, which does not make young people want to commit a crime.

The second possible cause is prohibition of doing something. Some juveniles have very strict parents who prohibite eating sweets, coming home late and stealing. Growing up these children realise that the vast majority of these prohibitons is not true and that may force them take something illegaly. If parents and teachers do not want to have negative effect of uprising the children, they should explain the nessecity of this doings and the difference in causes of overeatig and robbering.

One more possible reason why nowadays juveniles are committing the crimes is that this is a significant opportunity to get parents' attention. Children in many families are being grown up by grandparents or nurses, nevertheless they cannot spend enough time with parents. Some of them are interested in stealing because this action can link them with parents. And that is why they should spend more time with children.

To conclude, today there are a great number of children who are stealing different things. The causes of this phenomenon may be different. However in all the cases adults should spend more time with the younger generation and explain why some actions are not acceptable in our society.",65,2,0

Nowadays it is hard to find someone who is not regestered in any social network. the question that really matters is what should be the main aim for such kinds of web-sites. Some people say, that the main purpose of social networks is to help communicate information and share knowledge. Others tend to think that those web-sites are just another entertainment facilities. On the one hand, social networks were initially created to help people communicate and they still are means of transferring information. Firstly, it is easier to send some important filled via Vkontakte than via a common e-mail. For example, most of the classmates know each other’s social network accounts, but don’t remember personal  e-mails. Secondly, most of the media sources publish information both on their sites and on their pages in the social network. The reason is that it is easier for some people to learn everything they need from one site such as vk.com or facebook.com, than to visit different media websites, finally, social networks have a “share” option which enable users to share information they find interesting or usefull with their friends by a click of a mouse. On the other hand, entertainment context accounts for a bigger part on social networks than useful information, one reason for this is that many people see social networks as a way of relaxing during their leisure time. For example, people like to watch funny videos or read jokes when they are trying to relax. A second reason is that people try to earn money from the content on the social networks sites and entertainment always attracts more audience than usefull information, such as news. Finally same social networking sites nowadays don’t even give people ability to communicate and all count there is for entertainment. Instagram could be an example of a such time. In conclusion I’d like to share my opinion on this dilemma. I believe, that although entertaining became a crucial part of social networking model, communicating information and sharing knowledge still remains the main purpose of social networks. In my opinion people need quick and convenient ways of transferring information and therefore, if all social networks are aimed only at entertaining people, than soon a news one will be created for people to be able to exchange messages.

The problem is stated more serious than ever. What are the causes of this situation? How can parents and teachers help to solve this problem?
Nowadays people often do not spend enough time teaching moral to their children. The reason why young people start commiting crimes is the absence of understanding the consecuenses of their behavior. Children should be taught not only about punishments for criminals, but also about impact of crime on ordinary people.
On the one hand, parents should teach their children that if everybody would be kind to each other, there would be no crime and nobody would suffer from thefts, nobody will be killed or hurt. But if anybody starts to break the law, stimuls for other people to do the same things appear. The net effect leads to development of illegal business. That means that every criminal not only harms people with illegal actions but also stimulates the crime.
However the learning moral aspect is not enough. Young people should be taught at school which actions are legal and which are not and which kings of punishments follow different crimes. This side of education helps to exclude the situations when people commit crime without understandind the fact that they are breaking the law.
All things considered, the problem of crime development should be solved through education, which consists from two equally important parts: moral aspect and learning the law. First thing should be teached by the family, while second one can be teached by school teachers.

That is why a lot of people think that downloading of music or films without paying money for that production should be punished. There are some advantages and disadvantages of this point of view.
First and foremost, people spend a lot of money, huge sums to do a new film or music composition and it is unfaire when they are not able to get their money. Internet survesis get access to cope and share of somebody’s production. Perhaps, this types of sites should be block. And then authors’ rights will not break.
Moreover, arctors, producers, musicians, directors and other people who work in this industry should get their salary for their job. Sometimes people do understand that produsing of films is very expensive. Legal copies let to get a compensation.
That is why people who find and download files just stil them. And it is a type of crime. People who do crime should be punished. Different punishment led to increase of buying the original product (files, discs).
However there is another point of view. Persons who download pirate copies are not muders. They just try to share with people moves and beautiful music compusitions. Of course, some people feel like spending money for buying the legal copies is not productive and it can be too costy spend money to every film or disc of music. They do not care about people who make this production. In their oppinion, copying and sharing music or films on the Internet help them save money.
To sum up, punishmend for pirate copies should be in the state to provide authors’ rights, but in my oppinion they should not be very strict. Maybe shtrafs will be very suitable. can help producers get their benefits and will be useful for goverment and budget.

This is a very big problem for our society and many steps should be done to prevent young people from becoming criminals.
I am agree with the statemant 'we need to understand why is this happening and make something to change the situation. First of all, we all should agree that our century have many differences with oth other, but one of the most important ones is technology level. Today, a lot of young people play violent computer games, watch films about drugs and alchogol. This misslead teenagers and they do wrong things. To prevent it parents just need to spend more timy with their kids and, using the teacher' help, educate them what is good and what is bad. The second reason for this is that young people are still punished by their parents, and the modern life gives them more opportunity to make a crime (easier to find a gun, less risk of being killed). The edvice for parents is the same - they need  to think carefully about their children.
On the other hand, the modern society gives to teenagers more opportunities to educate themselfes. This should not lead to any bad concequances, how many says. They argue that technology make life easier. Also, they think that modern opportunity, which many countries give, such that hot water, heaters, electricity should make everyone, including parents, feel free to live their lifes and have less stress, so do less crimes or make bad thing for kids (to make them do crime).
To some it up, we live in the world with great opportunities. Technology gives us many good thing, but harm us as well. and tho prevent people, who are under the biggest risk of this harn (all young people), to do crimes educating them, making them happy everyday in their life.

There are several points of view on reducing crime. Some tend to believe that the best way is longer prison sentences. While others argue that there are better ways. Both views have their pros and cons. Increasing prison sentences can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about risk of spending most of their lifes in prison. But there is another side of this solution. First of all, prisons will take more money. From country budget as prison has to spend more on every prisoner. Second and may be even more important criminals will go for a higher crimes to avoid prison. For example, theift kill a man to avoid being caughted. Last problem is connected with the first one. Government will need to built more prisons to keep all criminals. It also take money from budget. But we have alternative ways? Yes, there are some other possible solutions to prevent crime. First one is reducing number of unemployed people. A lot of people go for crime just because they do not have something to it. Giving them a job can prevent them from going for crime. Second approach is to start with children. Most of the crimes start doing illegal during from the childhood. It is very important for parents or teachers, child phycologists to make sure that one do not you for a wrong road. Of course, many other steps that can help. In my opinion, longer prison sentence certainly is not the right solution, so we have to concentrate on alternative approaches and combine them for better results.

Secondly, some ways of expression the feelings are really helpful for creative person, but they can seem to be rude and unpleasant for other people. This misunderstanding can be bad for both sides of the conflict. And if the artist is careful about feelings of other people and does not act as he want in sight this way of expression becomes useless, because artist without viewers is nothing.

Others defend the different point of view. In this essay both supporting and attacking points will be considered.

Speaking about reasons why the number of places in university should be equal for each gender, I would like to mention that the balance of males and females in any working groups is significant. It has an impact on healthy attitude, good mood and pleasent relationships between the members of a group. There are some schools only for girls and only for boys now. Usually when pupils of such schools grow up they find hard to communicate with another gender because the have not got enough social skills in their past. Nevertheless, universities should not establish the similar education system.

On the other hand, there are argument, supporting the opposal view. Some professions require more physical pressure than other. That is why sometimes natural abilities may dictate our choice in some cases. For example, men are more likely to be an astronaut than women. The same in many other specialities, where the great stamina and strenth are demanded and absolutely obligatory. It is not enough to learn some skills you should have them naturally. Therefore, women are more seldom phenomena in such professions. It is not rational to give them as many places in university as men have when it is spoken about physically difficult professions.

To sum up, both views have rights to be discussed. Both of them can be logicaly argumented and supported. In my opinion, though, it is important to orient on speciality, which is chosen by student because question depends mostly on it.

Therefore there is an urgent need to counteract juvenile delinquency. The aim of the essay is to look into the possible causes of this problem and consider the measures which could be taken to solve it.

First of all, violence is propagated in numerous films and TV shows. Teenagers watching TV series depicting crime often get the impression that it is is an acceptable way of earning money and becoming successful. For this reason, I believe that discussing such films and TV programmes at school will help to change young people's attitude to this issue. Personally, I remember a round table discussion at school concerning a detective series of dubious quality, and all the students agreed that it should be banned because of the nagative values promoted in it.

Secondly, there is an infinite variety of computer games which involve fighting or killing. Some adolescents adopt a wrong bahaviour pattern while playing such games and become more aggressive. As a result, there are more murders carried out by youngsters. To my mind, parents should put a restriction on such games and encourage their children to acquire other hobbies, such as sports.

Another contributing factor to the high number of law violations by teenagers is unemployment. Some youngsters fail to find themselves a proper job and, consequently, tend to compensate for their shortage of money by shoplifting or even burglaring. That is why parents should be more helpful to their children in terms of their financial problems, and teachers should pay greater attention to explaining laws and regulations to their students.


To conclude, there are a number of factors due to which adolescents engage in illegal activities. However,there is a range of strategies to reduce crime rate among young people, and it is parents' and teachers' duty to implement them.",75,2,0

To continue this process people should keep their self in fit. That means that topic about public health is quite common. Some people thing that sport infrastructure can improve people`s health. Other told about other measures and think that sport have little effect on public healt.
Sport is the most common way to keep fit and stay healthy but sport is not so efficient as pharmacy, for instance. Hospitals and qualified doctors improve public healt much more that sport. Inventing peniciline and chemistry reseach gain more results than sport. To my mind, Pharmacy and free medicine can improve public health in better way than sports.
On the other hand, sport have come advantage. For example, sport look more natural than pharmacy. It also cheaper for nation and government than free medicine. And the most significand advantage of doing sport is that you prevent yourself from different illneses. At the same time, the main drowback of using pharmacy to improve your health is that you may damage one part of your common health when you heal anether part. 
In conclusion I want say that if people want to gain maximum level of public health they cant choose only sport on only medicine. The best way for humanity is to use theese things one with another. I mean that you should do some sport and time to time visit hospital on your own doctor if you want to become really healthy person.

Many people claim that this money would better be spent on some social issues (such as fight with poverty) or environment problems. Personally, I disagree with this point of view.
To begin with, investing money in space exploration is also investing money in the future itself. Who knows, perhaps we will be forced to leave Earth, and space exploration programs might come in handy in such scenarios. Furthermore, space is all around us, so I suppose we should know a lot of things about it and all the other possible variants for relocation.
Secondly, space exploration may bring us new sources of different resources, or even get us some new materials we have never heard of! Space is immensly big, so there might be something interesting and useful out there, so why not explore it?
On the other hand, those who what governments to stop space exploration programs and spend all that money on other problems can be understood. First, space programs can result in nothing, so they might seem like a waste of money. Second, these programs are really costly, so a lot of money is being pumped into the sphere, without knowing the result, and if the result is not satisying enough, people (whose taxes are the specdings being pumped) may get angry.
Overall, I believe that these space exploration programs should not be stopped. Even though they might seem like a waste of money, it is always good to be ahead of your opponents, and space exploration programs may give such an opportunity.",60,2,0

The first chart shows the proportion of goods transported by rail and the second one by road.
Having compared the charts we can see, that manifactured goods are transported most of all both by rail and by road. Metals are the most likely cargo for a train (35% of rail transportations compared to the 11% of road), while food products are preferably moved by car. Both these facts can be logically explained, metals weigh more (and machinery does as well), so trains are more suitable for them, and food expires much faster, so it can be transopted only on short distances. Chemicals and manufactured goods are transported equaly by rail and by road.
To sum up, both trains and cars are importaint for transportation of goods. In some spheres, such as metal and food transportation, one dominates over the other, and in other ones, for example transporting manufactured products or chemicals, they are used equaly.",70,1,0

We can see that percent of unemployers in North Africa, South Asia and overall the world remains stable. So there is no difference in world’s unemployment rate between 2014 and 2015. 

Secondly, we can see a little fall of unemployment in Middle East. I’m not sure, but I think it depends on oil and gazoline money. Because the development of this industry gives people a lot of places for work. We can see the same fall of unemployment in Latin America, so Europe remains the only region with rising percentage of unemployment. It is simply understandable, because today in EU we have a huge demography crisis. 

Summarizing all these facts, I can conclude without fluctuations, that worldwide percentage of unemployment remain stable or allowable level. So as my opinion, the solution of this problem can’t be a main goal of mankind nowadays.

To begin with, the major part of volonteeres, who worked in unpaid community service are students and schoolers. If this service be a part of school, students will have better conditions of working. For example they may have some extra points in the school while working. Also, students will have the opportunity both to work and stydy at the same time.
What is more, if theis service become a part of the schools, this communitys will be advertised by schools and so that more numbers of volonteeres will work there. Students will talk with each other about this kind of work. And school will promote in class this work. All this will lead to increasing the number of workers.
Moreover, this kind of work will teach students responsibility. Working as a volonteere make students to grow up mentaly and be responsible.
Another big advantage of this situation is that students, spending there free time in school. This will prevent them from street influence. Such as drugs, alchogol and robbening.
The last reason, why school and unpaid communitys should be unite is government donate. If this two organisations will be unite, government will donate more money to school. This will provide more equipment both to school and to charity. This fact will increase the effectivity of the volontere work and also will increase the number of students, involved in this work.
All in all, there are a lot of argument for compresing this both organisations in one.

There are several possible causes of this development, but the main reason is obviously the spread of computer games. Nowadays a teenager do not face problems with access to computer shooters and digital mazes full of bloody monsters. These games teach youngsters how to kill. Faced with murders and violence in computer games, teenager considers anger as a normal way of acting. The difference between the reality and imagined world is gone for young people. That is why story, when a child with axe murders family for prohibiting playing computer, exists.
Another reason of such trend can be the lack of opportunity for young people. Youngsters, struggling with self-realisation, and suffer from lack of motivation, see no solution of their situation, except committing a crime. On the labour market young experts are not demanded. It is hard for them to find job.
However, paying more attention to child’s activity can easily solve the problem. If parents and teachers pay attention to teenager’s development, interests and education, the trend will probably decrease. What is more, computer games are the sign of boredom, that is why it is important to provide youngster with extra courses. Person who finished high education, has less chance to commit a crime. Statistic, provided by developed countries, shows that crucial amount of crimes involve people without education.
To sum up, if parents want to prevent their child from crimes and prizon, they need to pay attention to his or her education and provide different opportunities as free-time activities.

But other people argue that this would have little effect on public health.
Firstly, the increasing number of sports facilities improve public health. It is obvious, that different kinds of sports allow people to chose what they want according to their skills, preferences and a level of health. The good example that illustates if we can see in HSE. There are lots of free sport section and you can choose from swimming to football, basketball and so on. Students of the HSE go to sport, that is why we have good health. It is very important for us, because every day we have stressful situations that are harmful for our health. Sports help us to relax and allow not to think about staduing. 
Secondly, there is opinion that increasing the number of sport facilities would have little effect on public health. People of such thoughs believe that nowdays lots of sports facilities are useless and that they do not improve our health. For example today there are lots of new section of boxing. Such kinds of boxing are created only for earning money. Also it is important to say, that very often such sections destroy our health. Today parents tend to develop their children and unfortunately do not know some feachers of different sports before sending their children to sport sections. 
In conclusion I want to say that increasing number of sports facilities is good, because it expands our choices. But we should be very careful for choosing sport, because it depends on your health.

People can not stop wondering: What are the possible reasons to that? Is there anything that can be done to decrease this horrible tendency? In my opinion, one of the reasons of this issue roots in mass media, the Internet in particular.
Today it offers its users an unlimmited access to enormous amount of different data which should be filtered sometimes. An adult person can hardly handle this relentless flow of information, let alone our children. The perception of the young brain is prone to be influenced by others. For example, there can be found blogs, or groups in social media that have violence propaganda, abuse. Young people may be encouraged to break the law to get what the want or bully others to make them feel better about themselves. Some of these groups are even involved in serious crimes, such as robbery and murders.
The second reason is parenting. Nowadays we all have such a rush and try to gain more money than we probably can spend. Parents are to busy with work and household chores that they do not pay enough attention to their children. They rarely wonder that their kid is passionate about, whathe would like to do in his life. They mostly worry about their education and future salary.
This horrible lack of attention makes young folks look for it somewhere else and they find it online where they can do nothing but get sucked into the uncontrollable world of the Net.
I personally believe, that this issue should be considered as one of the most important. In schools they should teach how to filter the information you get while parens are to take care of the future of their child and pay more attention to their interests and at least be aware of the people that surround their kid.",70,2,0

Nobody can deny that sports facilities inprove our feelings, health and bodys. I think that in this way we can help our body to save tonus. For example, nowadays there are a lot of different kinds of gim schools, where people with different skills should do exersices. In this schools trainer takes into consideration all fitches of people especially their health. 
Secondly I can say that all people have favorite sport. If they have possibility to do this sport, they will have a good mood. With the helps of this people develop their inside statement. In this way people inprove their health.
However, there is a point of view that increasing the number of sports facilities would have little effect on public health. I think that it is particularly true, because a lot of sport exercises can have bad influence helth of people. If people have huge passiont to doing sport, then they can not remember about their health.
From my point of view, increasing the number of sports facilities improve public health. But I think that people must change attitude on doing sport. Instead of doing this with passion, people must choose time for doing sport exercises.
Despite on other people`s opinion. I still believe that sport is a big part of our life, which helps to enjoy our bodys and health.

Some people even think, that not only distributors, but also consumers of illegal or “pirate” content should be punished. Of course, it’s very difficult problem and we can hardly solve it finally. However, I’m agree with only one part of this statement. It is true, that we should punish people, who illegally copy and share films or music, because it is property and property rights should be protected strictly. However, sometimes a producer of some content leaves it in open access and anyone can download or share it. Consequently, sharing and copying it will not be illegal.
Moreover, another question arises – should we blame or punish consumers of “pirate” content? Should we blame peasants, who get food from Robin Hood? They didn’t steal anything and they had no aim to violate the laws. In addition, practically all modern scientific theories are based on “rationality” of an individual person. Therefore, if he dounloads file of something else, which is in open access on the internet for free instead of buying it for some amount of money (Modern films’ and music album’s cost is rather high, that is another reason why people dounload “pirate” content), should we blame him for rationality.
All in all, the problem of illegal copying and sharing is a lot more complex than some people think. No doubt, people, who violates laws and distribute illegal content should be punished. Anyhow, punishing people, who use this content would be cruel and unfair.

To my mind, the definition of happiness depends on people, because different factors determine every personality. However, it is very important for each person to feel happy. How we can define, what is happiness and what do we need to do to achieve it?
I agree with statement that although the happiness is very important in life, it is very difficult to define what is it. To begin with, our personalities are determined by some factors like the level of life, habitats, education, family, culture. These factors form our needs and wants. For each person happiness means different because the features of culture, different worldview, goals. For example, people can feel happy if they have enough food every day, but for people from modern cities with the high pece of life it is not enough. On the contrary, they have some goals, which are connected with career and money. In this case happiness can mean success in different spheres of life.
It is generally accepted that a lot of philosophers tries to define what happiness is. However, they have not an answer for this question. It is very clear from these observations that it was always difficult to determine what makes people happy. Moreover, there are a lot of books about love and success and strong people, who can cope with difficulties. But, essentially, it is argued that this issue is discussion for humankind.
We dream about being happy. Nevertheless, people often do was know how to achieve happiness. I think that it is impossible to say whos factors are important in achieving happiness because each person wants feel happy in his personal way. According to some experts, the exteut of happiness in different countries depends on the level of life and opportunities to realize themselves. As for me, the main factor for achieving happiness is having family and friends, who love and support you.
In conclusion, I would like to say that happiness is very difficult to define because people have different willings and needs, which depends on different factors. What is more there are no particular factors to achieving happiness. If you want to be happy, just be happy without some thoughts about money or your willings.

Also, this internation companies has a huge influence to local economic because of changing industry in this place. Second advantage is doing process of making cheaper. Using local workers gives a possibility for a company to pay less because in general workers in developing countries have no alternative way to get many. That means, the companies may create products for new group of custumest, who can not buy something previously. Some people may say, that moving offices to poor countries will crashed the business. But for real, international companies has a incredible chance to find cheap workers and this saving money will help them to grew main offices in such big countries an USA or Russia, for example. A chance to grow business minimalized the risk to lose it. To sum up, trend of creating local offices in countries with bad economies has goods as for businessmen, as for workers.

The increased these health problems we are witnessing today could be caused by a number of reasons. First of all, because sometimes we spend too much time sitting with our iphones or laptops, which leads to pout seeing. Secondly, modern population by more vehicles, move and walk less and finally put on weight, which consequently leads to some heart problems. Another important factor is air pollution, caused by increasing number of vehicles, especially in big cities. Air pollution affect negatively  on our respiratory sistem. And what makes things worse is that nobody can do anything with this problem. If we live in urban area we can’t stop breath this air.

What is needed to improve the situation is a definite action. Our daily life needed to be improved. We should know more about time management and restrict time we’re spending with every type of modern gadget. Other measures could include eating healthy food, doing more fisical activities and spending more time outside the home, or what is better outside the urban area. Another obvious solution is to encourage people to co-operate and share one vehicle with other people. In that way we can deal with air pollution or minimize it. 

To summarize, I believe that the effects of modern technology on people’s health is too serious to ignore. Some measures have to be taken soon, otherwise the environment and our health will be at great risk.

However, I do not think that it is useful to let them do it freely without any concern from the government.
We are living in the liberty and democracy country, so not only artists but also everyone has truly rights to do what he or she wants. Creative artists, in particular, can feel respected when they have freedom to show their ideas to the world. They may feel people believe I them and always wait to see their new ideas such as words, pictures, music or film. In addition, this feeling can give them motivation which makes them create more wonderful production.
Nevertheless, it will be too risk for the government to have no restriction on what artists do. Some violent and erotic paintings may be drawn everywhere in the streets like walls, park benches and even in the schools. It can be worse. For example, an artist goes to a museum, and he suddenly has a new idea about his new picture. He may draw his thoughts on some cultural heritages. He ignores the rules of the museum because he is free to express his idea in any way. Those things will destroy the beauty of civilized streets, the solumnity of buildings and galleries. The worst thing is that children can be badly affected by some abstract paintings for which they are not old enough to understand.
In conclusion, it is essential to make creative artists feel free to product more new creations to the life. The care here is that artists should be aware of using their freedom cleverly and the government should always care the creations of their citizens.

Members of society often do not concerned about the role of air travel in air pollution so they have fights very frequently. If mass media warn the citizens about the consequences of air travel, people may make a shift to another mode of transport. Moreover, governments ought to introduce special laws and taxes on tickets, depending on the amount of carbon emissions produced.

However, it is frequently asserted that the more developed and diverse gadgets are the more people suffer from different deseases.
In this essay a number of problems caused by increasing use of technology will be discussed. First of all, a poor eye-sight should be mentioned. A rising popularity of smartphones, laptops, computers and other gadgets leads to damage to people's eyes. For instance, the statistics which can be received from doctors of other specialists can examplify this trend. Nowadays, the age when people start suffering from poor vision has decreased significantly. More than that, in modern world people spend a lot of time in front of the computer or TV and this sitting lifestile has a serious impact on people's health including backacke, obesity and phsycological problems.
Undoubtedly, people try to find different ways to contract the number of existing problems. Firstly, a healthy lifestile is gaining popularity and this tendency is supported by governments of many countries in Europe, by the USA and others. Moreover, a special time for physical activity could be included the the process of working or studying. Besides, an increase in the number of free services for eye chaking, for instance, may help to recognise and prevent such problems. Also the government could provide free bycicals for people.
In conclusion, it should be pointed out that inspite the number of health problems technological progress and growing use of technology has significan advantages. Therefore, people should find ways to reduce these problems but should not reduce the technology.

First of all, the main reason of such result is that our characteristics we are born with depend completly from ancestors DNA. I biology science this theme is very useful and can become a huge step in future. Our DNA gives us characteristics of our fathers and grandfathers. It is the main factor which influe on the building personal individual character. All habits which we gain in our life change our personality. But main roof of our individualism consists in D.N.A.
On the other hand, there is another opinion. Psychologists all over the world suppose that the roof of our character renews every day. Behavior theory told us about stumul attention – consume system which is still actuall for nowadays. Behaviorists to understate their point of view give us example domestic animals. Their character is rather different than wild animals have. It happens because of environment and rules of behavior that their owners give them. Comparing human been and animal been scientists get many same sides of character. Without behavior human will have such personality as animal.
In the conclusion, I have to say that research information have some disagreement in it. The main feature is that D.N.A. code consists 30% of human character development. It is a fact that behavior principels allow human to enhaste himself. But the roots of our personality are the characteristics we are born with.

On the one hand, air travel is the fastest way to travel. Millions of people all over the world use airlines every day. The decrease of flights might affect the pace of life and cause some disagreements between common people and governments. One more negative affect of banning some flight is that other ways of travel are less safe. Even though many people are afraid of flights, it is proved that airlines is the safest kind of transport.
In my opinion there is another solution of this problem. Government should introduce laws about extra taxes which would go to cleaning systems. The price will increase for sure, but that’s the only possible way of reducing air pollution without affecting people’s needs I see.

However, there are some groups which are disagree with this opinion. As for me, I completely agree with the siggested statment, based on increasing of new laws. It could help to dicrease the amount of consumers in air tourism. Futhermore, this decision may lead to necessity of creating of new ways of fuels for plane, wich would not be such insecure, as it was before.
Initially, it should be said creating of the new code, wich would not exept the public usage of air travels for buisness and leisure needs, could make people think about journey by train insread of plane. It is evident, this type of transerring could be observed as much less harmful for the nature. For example,train could transport more amount of passenger for one time, than plain. Accordingly, it would cause less damage.
The necessity of refusing from air travels, moreover, may open plemty of new possibilities for humanity in general. If the people had not abilities for utilising of habitual ways of engines, theey would have to invent something new. Scientists, for instance, would have much more stimules for creating modern safety types of fuel.

Should universities have the same amount of numbers of male and female student in every subject or not? It is a difficult question to discuss. In my opinion, it is not so important to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.

Firstly, it depends on the person what subject to choose. Every university has a huge amount and it is not so easy to choose your favourite. Moreover, your future career depends on your subjects and marks too. So, the amount of male and female students in your group will be the last thing you will think about in this situation.

Secondly, some subjects are not so popular in male and female groups. For example, physics and chemistry are most easier to understand for male group. However, female group prefer literature and history more. So, it is rare to see a lot of boys during the time of that subjects.

Nevertherless, some people think that the acception of male and female with the equal amount is very importauant for communication between that groups. Therefore, a social life can be more interesting, energetic and positive.

All in all, people can change their opinions from time to time. So, they can think in different ways and do not have answer for this question. It depends on many social and intellectual factors, which can have nothing in common between them. Every person should think what is the best variant for him and make a personal decission.

Nowadays people can get to then destination point on another continent in a few hours, and it, costs nearly the same as travel firstly on train and then on ship , which would take ages to compare with even trips on a short distances could afford almost energy person in developed countries.

Nowadays social media in widespread among population of developed and developing countries. The topic of media functions is widely discussed. Some people consider that social nets help share information and knowledge. Others are sure that the main aim of such internet resources is entertaining. In this essay I will respect both opinions and express my own opinion. The first argument, which supports the first position, is the spend of sharing cruciate scientific facts in social fats. It is a common knowledge that young people are phone to share a necessary information with their classmates a friends in different charts and their posts or messages are sent immediate and received. For example, it’s more convenient for a professor or, a teacher to type only one message to their students and send it to England than to use e-mail. Moreover, scientific publics with information post are read by millions of people. They comment, give their opinions and even publish their own small researches. For instance, some online magazines published on Facebook allow to find something new and offer your thoughts for publication. On the other hand, for number of population consider that the function of social nets one bordered by entertaining. Firstly, relax is the main goal of some people who spend time in the accounts of Vkontakte and Facebook. For example, they seek for funny photoes and comic videos without the features of an intellectual value. Secondly, communication with friends in an informal way is used by these people. Messages with a great amount of smiles and grammar mistakes are normal in society. Some of young people or teenagers collect a significant number of pictures, which impressed them. Moreover, they share own photoes not feel happiness when friends like them. For example, Instagram is not used as even the way of promotion of new products because of the fact that most users are interested only in posting their own photoes. Besides, it’s impossible to post a scientific information in hashtags and text lactued there. All in all, social media have different functions. In my opinion, with the help of future development of social nets they will be able to strike the balance between informing and entertaining, but now most of these resources only entertain users.

Of course, goverement should control all these air travel, but risk and interest of life – this is something without what we can't imagine a person. If someone told you that you can go somewhere with plane just for a buisness, and of course you should show suggestion, for man this will be not good information. Because as we know every person is free and this idea will be not pleasent for him.

To sum up, air travel is something what is very popular in every country and without what we can't imagine our life. If the goverement introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for buisness and leisure, after that will be problem and people will not be satisfyed.

As we can see, Facebook is the most popular network of these three. 87% of 18-29 age group users have Facebook account. It is 44% more than Instagram users and 4 times more than LinkedIn users do. All the other groups' percentage for Facebook is more than twice higher compared to other two social networks.
There is a difference between LinkedIn and other two - it is used mostly by middle-age adults and older (30-64 years), while Facebook and Instagram attract young population. This happens because LinkedIn is a social network for working adults - collegues, etc. And FB and Instagram are used mostly for the entertainment features.
So, the chart shows that Facebook is the most usable social network in US, because more than 50% of every adult group use it. Instagram is popular between young people: more than 50% of 18-29 age group use it.
LinkedIn is used by older people, still, even in 30-64 age group Facebook has higher indicator.

However, some people believe they don’t have to pay for it because they can download these files. Personally I am sure that such thieves should be punished, but there is still an other idea of too high prices exists.
First of all, I must say that musicians and film producers spend much money while creating their art products. The price includes the time authors had to spend to find an idea, the time and other kind of resources they had to spend to reach the aim of starting their project and money to record and sell everything that musicians and producers have made. Moreover, artists spend years and years to become those people they are and to be able to create something extraordinary. That is why people who steal the results of such an enourmous work should be punished. Finally, illegal copying of discs is punished by the law (however, it is too difficult to find internet “pirates”).
From the other hand, although I believe it is unfair to steal the property of other owners, the price of discs is too high. As a result, people who cannot afford it have to download pirate copies. Furthermore, it should be said that the disc costs almost nothing whereas to buy a film people have to pay hundreds of rubbles. It is much better to have a rest and visit cinema using these money. That is why I think authors of music and film art may be guilty of losing their money because of illegal downloading.
In conclusion, I woudld like to say that I am 75% sure that a theft should be followed by punishment, but at the same time I am 25% sure that it is unfair to ask such a high price.

It seems obviously that law breakers must be punished.There are different ways of reducing crime level, but some of the methods can be not effective.  Some people believe that staying in prisons for a longer time can dramatically help reduce the crime level. To begin with, living in  prisons make law breakers to think over their behaviour and the punishment they got and make a desicion to become later lovers of the lows and good citizens. In addition, if law breakers are in prisons, the society will not suffer from new crime commited them, because being in prisons  they have not a chance to commit recedive crime acts for people who are freedome. Moreover, longer prison periods can be helpful in preventing crime levels, because some people can be frightened by this way of punishment. On the other hand some people consider, that alternative methods of dropping crime level are more helpful. Firstly, they suppose that killing law breakers allow to avoid recedive crime acts and give an effective example for those who only plans to commit a crime.   Secondly,making law breakers work in a hard way as drivers, cleaners or etc. without any payment can help government both reduce the crime level and not to spend money for prisons. Thirdly, it is believed that social advertisement like short fims where negative effects of crime acts are explained is a good way to reduce crime, because media materials have a greate impact on the all people.  In conclusion, it can be stated that there are varies of ways of decreasing crime and all of them have their benefits and disadvantages at the same time. Personally, I believe that giving longer prison punishment is a good method, however other ways are also necessary to make reducing crime level more effective.  ",65,2,5

We cannot but mention that air is in a dangerous because plans hurt our atmosphere.
Some people suppose that the air trips follow to air pollution and global warming but the atmoshere should be saved and so the government should reduce all flights. First of all, such pollution can call a lot of deyings of birds. It can be seen by an example of a reseurch project about natural life which was writted by sociologist Tomas Korn from United Kingdom at the beginning of 21 centure. In accordind this work, more birds are died than in the past and one of the major causes is pollution of airs. The difference between our century and 20 century is more than 35% that is very sad. More than that, the pollution of air do begger an ozon crow and it is a cause of global warming and so it is very important process and habitants can away a help in this situation only from government.
On the other hand, there is opinion that the cause of such pollution is not only plans but also fabrics because they create a lot of bad gases. They say that the good example is the best sermon and so it can be showed on the big (in the 20 century) fabric which locates in Dzerzinsk and it is name is Corund. This building has a very big influence on air and so Dzerzinsk became one of the unclearest towns of Russia and took the second place in this rate. Moreover, cars and bus do more pollution than the plans and so the road kinds of transport are worse than the plans.
Thus, I partly agree with this position. Although, the air trips has a negative effect on the atmosphere, cars, bus and fabrics have to considered first.",55,2,0

The vast majority of people think that sport facilities is the best way of improving health, but other people think that sport can not influence on our health and government should use another ways. Who is right?


On the one hand, sport plays a great role in our life. People who going in for different kinds of sport or simply do working exercises are more stronger and healthier than others. Moreover, those who fond of sport usually eat only healthy food, do not smoke and drink alcohol. In my opinion, government should build more sport centers and increase another sport facilities. They should stimulate people to be going in for sport and be fond of healthy life style.


On the other hand, sometimes sport can be dangerouse.  A lot of proffesional sportsmens have various problems with their health, for example broken leg or arm . Today we live in the modern world in which there are a lot of different ways to improve health. For instance, healthy food is very important for our health. Government, should prohibite fast food cafes and advertisement of their products. Another way of healthy life style is reducing factories and cars, which polluted our air, water and ground. We should use more safety things for our invoroment.


To sum up, we can see that sport has its pros and cons. Usually, it occurs to be healthy, but sometimes people can find more suitable way for them to be healthy.

Obviously, it can cause some different problems. However, the item in topic seems to be a mixed blessing, as there are many reasons for this point.
Firstly, when child grows up, he creates his own world, with self point of view, self sight in the things and of course, with his own people – friends, and later, family. So, usually when both parents go out to work their children have their own families, or, at least, a partner. This item defines the following thing: our already not young child lives separated, in other words, far from his parents. This is the one reason. Secondly, also the obvious poin, is that when the child become older, some important things is appearing, such as education or job. This is why students or employees cannot spent a lot of time with close people, in particular, with their parents, because of general business. No need to say, it always causes problems. The first and the most dangerous if that old parents are staying alone. There are no one to help them with everyday issues, no one to care about them or, finally, to simply talk with them. So, old parent feel themselves lonely. The second problem is that because of spending less time with parents than in the past, children sometimes break good relationships between them and parents. Senior people see their falt in the lack of attention to their children, and for second one this is the main argument: they do not look well after them, and this is the root of all their life problems. Sad, but true. In conclusion it should be said, that everyone is free to choose their own way in life, and to choose, how to communicate with parents. But ethics rules warn us not to forget about our parents, because this is our first and most important family.

It is crucial to prevent this process from futher expansion and in this case we should understand the causes of this development and try to figure out appropriate sollutions.

Firstly, it is known that in our modern society Internet and various social networks play indispenseble role in our lives. This innovative technologies open teenagers a new world, where they can face not only educative and useful information.
Some websites can trigger young people to break the law, because where they can find some illegal or even dangerous data, which affect their minds. THe sollution for this problem is obvious: parents and teachers can observe, which information teenagers search for and even sometimes block these dangerous websites.

It would be unfair not to mention that nowadays the process of nurturing children and teenagers is considered by many parents not so significant as earning a lot of many. This careless attitude causes a lot of problems and sometimes even reflects on the teenagers' view of the world. It is vital for adults to understand all the responsibility they have when they bring up a baby. If they do not care about their children, they can become immoral people and commit crimes as usual everyday activity. What conclusion can be drawn from all of this?

Some people are willing to solve this problem by prohibition for athlets to compete for some time while others do not tend to excuse such froad and the want these athlets to be banned from official sport competitions forever.
On one hand, the main aim of actions taken towards the person who broke the law should be complete understanding by this person of his or her mistake. After that it would be logical to give this person a second chance. The athlets who once were caught using illegal drugs due to conseption given above should be banned from competing professonaly for a limited period only. More over, modern society tend to solve the problem of drug usage by the competitors on the level of the users but not sistematically, including responsibility of the trainer, the whole team etc. The ploblem of illegal drugs in sport consist of the whole competition system and people who work there. Therefore, the banning of one athletes for the rest of his or her life without the investigation of the whole system would be quite cruel because his or her actions could have been made due to external influence but not only athlete's internal problems.
On the other hand, people who are eager to prohibite illegal drug users enter to sport competitions forever have some point too. First of all, nobody can be sure that an athelete who used drugs once is not going to use it again. If the main reason for it is that the athelete is insecure about he or her abilities in sport then this problem cannot be solved by ban for some period of time, more over, it can be solved only by phycologist. The most common fear behind such position consist of the opinion that the athelete who has serious phycological problems cannot compete and it makes sense obviously. In my opinion, phycological problems can be solved anyway, and the athlete who made a mistake of using illegal drugs can be taken back to sport.
In conclusion I would like to say that the problem of drugs in sport is very relevant but despite some advantages of radical banning drug users from sport forever, I think that any person should be given a second chance.

Others suppose that moving to a developing country can be a life time decision, which can help to make a fortune and be successful there. I agree with the second opinion, and I want to explain my thoughts on this subject. Firstly, international companies moving to other country can cut down expenditures on taxes, because mostly developing countries do not have high taxes.  Also, local workers usually are cheap, so company can spent money on it’s own development. Secondly, movement to developing countries gives a company a chance to take the lead on the local market, because if such a country is poorer so the company will not have a trouble contesting with other analoges. No doubt that the company will be the most successful in that area. However, there are people considering that movement to other country is a huge mistake. Then reckon that the movement can cause some troubles like problem with adoption to a new resources, new markets or even rules, so  that movement can lead to a company’s destroyment. I disagree, though, because changing for any company is a big step, and a wise director should think about all features and possible risks before. When all was said and done, I would like to stress that changing place for a company has more advantages than disadvantages but if the director do not make his best to make better success, the company will be in troubles, obviously.

In my opinion the goverment do not have to punish people who buy such products, but people who produce illegal pirate copies should be punished. Nowadays, the biggest part of people buy or download films of music in internet in such web-sites like amazon or ebay. Of course in the internet you can not understand is it an original disc or it is not. Moreover, sellers do not want to tell real information about their production especially about quality and manufacturer. Futhermore, that means that many buyers even do not know that they buy illegal products.
In other hand, there are people who get huge amount of money every month from producing illegal copies of famous musical groups. Such people make illegal version of original discs and sell it in internet or in some small shops. They get a huge amount of money doing this illegal work and in my opinion they should be punished.
In conclusion, musical and film producers lose their money from illegal pirate copies. People who by such illegal products sometimes even do not know that it is not original, and they pay money and get a bad product with an awfull quantity. So in addition people who produce pirate copies should be punished.

Some people argue that the improvement of sports facilities will have a great positive effect on public health. However, others claim that this is not the most effective way to improve social health.


I personally agree with the first point of view for several reasons. There is no doubt that the growing popularity of including sport in one's lifestyle encourages people to do more sport. Looking at the adds of new fitness clubs with beautiful and powerful people on them makes people believe that sporting activities will affect their level of happiness and life sutisfaction. That is the reason why more people will join fitnessclubs in case of the improvement of sports facilities.


Furthermore the rise of the number of sports facilities leads to the bigger competition between sport clubs owners, which in turn leads to the improvement of quality of sports facilities and to the reduction of prices. This definitely stimulates people to become a member in fitness club.


On the other hand it is clear that people are not likely to change their daily routine because of the well-promoted fitnessclubs. Obviously, those who are interested in doing sports regulary already do this.


Summarising the ideas I would like to conclude that people generaly tend not to change their lifestyles. However better access to sports facilities with the help of clever promotion will defenately impact on people's attitude to sport. That is why not only a growth of the number of sports facilities is needed to improve public health, but also an extention of the idea of healthy lifestyle.

Imagine that you have beside to commit a crime under the risk of 25 year sentences. It is not likely, that year decision is going to change it the new legistation pushes 50 year sentence as a punishment – both of this basically seem to be “forever”. I saw an interview with a man, who was sentences to 54 years to dealing drugs in Texas. He said: “I didn’t know what the punishment is, because I didn’t care – I believed that I wouldn’t be caught” . extending the terms is not very effective when they are already long. The other reason is that keeping prisoners costs very much to the society. This includes the direct costs of punishment system to the expayers, the benefits lost, because people in prison are not working, al least productivity, the costs added by rehabilitation after the long sentence, and the poisonous society, that is in prison. This society can easily replace old social links to the prisoners and turn a prison that have mistake once to a true hardline criminal. I saw a police statistics in a magazine article, that so % of people, who were punt into a prison for a small crime once, are thn caught for a more serious one. Overall, longer sentences will hardly reduce any crime while costing a lot of whole society.

The main trend which is obvious from the picture is growth of investment worldwide from 2006 with 100$ bn to 2011 with 279$ bn. The spentiture then decreased by 214$ bn in 2013. The bar chart, which is situated on the bottom part of the picture shows differs between investment in developed and developing countries. It is clear from the graph that developing countries spend less money on renewable energy than developed countries. however it is shown that decrease of investment in developing countries was not so dramatical and consisted only approximately 10 $ bn from 2011 to 2013. Summarizing the information from the graph it can be say, that developed countries need renewable energy more, than developing ones, so they spend more money for that. 2011 year was the most successful for the renewable energy industry and now it is hard to predict the willing trends. It can only be predicted that gap between investment in developed and developing countries will be smaller than before because of constructing new technologies.

However, other people say that many other measures will be more effective. In my opinion the public  health could be improved by combining differents ways. First of all, the goverment should increase the number of sport facilities, for example, build new gym centres in schools and universities or create some new sport competitions for all family. Seconly, the goverment should ban cars from city centre. This option will not only help to save the historical heritage of city, but also prevent people from breathing dangerous gases. Furthermore, it is also very important to decrease the number of industrial and domestic wastes which are poured into our rivers and seas. As a result of water pollution all people especially children who swim a lot in our lakes have serious health problems. Another  measure which will help improve public health is the fight with smoking and alcohol drinking. I strongly believe that smoking shouldn’t be allowed in all public places, especially restaurants and cafes where there are a lot of people with children. It is also necessary to add in school timetable a special subject where children will be told about the dangerous effect of cigaret which tell youngsters about terrible consiquances of drinking alcohol, smoking and taking drugs. All in all, I’d like to say that not only the increasing the number of sports facilities will help to improve public health, but the combination of different factors will make our nation much more healthier.

But some people think that it is wrong, because air travel is dangerous for our environment. So, lets discuss about this problem. It think that air travel really pollute air and it is not good for people’s and animal’s health. Territories of forests which can clean air and make oxygen is very small because of deforestation. Because of it this problem can become more dangerous. Air planes produce some hard gases in the atmosphere, which can set on trees and pollute environment. Air travel is not the best way to travel. But we can find a lot of ways to reduse results of this problem. Reduce the amount of air travel can be hot useful, and this is too hard way in my point of view and point of view of a lot of people. Reduction of air transport will nave a bad results if people will begin travel on trains and busses. These types of transport are more dangerous for environment and allows to develop green-house effect. Moreover, air transport is the most harmless type of transport. In addition, reduction of air transport will have negative results for air companies and this business in sum. I consider that instead of reduction air travel people should to grow new forests and control chemical and feed production on factories. I disagree with prohibition of air travel for business and leisure. To sum up, I would to say that thi problem two sides, but I still believe that people can pay attention on other ways to solve problem of pollution, and on other ways to support our environment.

There are lots of different ways of solving this problem, one of the most popular is making people more interested in sport, by means of investing in different public sport facilities.


According to some people, this way of solving health problem is really efficient. It brings great opportunities for young children who could train for free, it could make people think about spending their free time at stadiums. Doing sports can also make them think about the quality of the food they consume, becouse to reach some success in sports, they should be sure to eat only healthy one. To my mind, this sound reasonable. Providing sport facilities could be really helpful for whole the nation, just becouse people will have some alternatives for spending their lasure time. Inspite of watching TV, they can go and play football. I think that there could be no accounting about the fact that sport is good for health : it makes people move, it makes them interested in something.


But, there is another view on the moment of how efficient providing sport facilities is. Some people are deeply convinced, that nobody or a very small percantage of people will change their life in a more helthear way becouse of government's investments in building public places for training... I'm not really sure, that this position has some serious reasons to exist, and it would be strange if investments in such sphere could not make any substantial effect.

I don’t agree with this oppinion and I give some reason for and against.

First of all, many contries have only idea of modern technology and littel space for grothing plants. Their contries should save more food resurses which they produce and limited trancfer out meal. However a lot of contries don’t suffer from this issue, it is importent problm for all. Eech development contries usually earn and damage by own grounds, and that influence on the world. Thus we should save more products for ourself and less sell our producing food.

On the other hand, contries which use agro-cultures like average earing can’t stop or decrease import and sell because it influece bad on economic of conties.

In cocntution, It is very neccessory and diffcult question, In my view It is importent more food resurses spend on population eats and less on import.

There are two different solution to problem of this illegal action - either banning athletes for a limited period of time from their sport carrier, or banning them from it permanently. In this essay I will examine both these solutions and provide my point of view.
First of all, I can absolutely see the source of desire to ban such athletes completely from their professional field. Sport is not supposed to be just about competitions, scores and Pepsi ads with recognizable athlets. The core of every sport, whether it is figure-skating or football, is its spirit. Spirit of sport, spirit of competition, which is a mean to provide people test of their abilities. Achievements in such competition is a result of true passion and hard work. Illegal drugs alter the condition of competition to the point where your spirit and passion do not matter. Therefore people who use them are offensive to the very concept of proffesional sport and should not be allowed to it at all.
On the other hand, such firm punishment, which can have drastic effect on person's life, can be considered too arbitrary. All people make mistakes at some points of their live. It is important for us not to dwell on them and move on. Perhaps, reconsider our values. Athets are people too, however inhumane their abilities may seem. They also make mistakes and it is important to provide them room for correcting their mistakes, as it is with any other human being. And banning them for a limited period is exactly the room for correcting mistakes and detoxicating - both physically and mentally.
Overall, I believe both approaches to solution of problem of use of illegal drugs should be taken in consideration when developing ligislation regarding this issue. However, we should pay the closest attention to fate and personality of particular athlete, taking into account his or her intentions. Individual approach is necessity in every issue that affects human-beings.

In terms of gender, I’d like to highlight that there has been less girls than boys who didn’t go to primary school only once. That was in South Asia 2012. Nevertheless, there has always been more uneducated girls than boys in Africa and the rest of the World.

Some people say, that women do not deserve good salary, or better life conditions, or advanced education, but such ideas are against human rights.
One, of the important questions is that, should universities accept male and female students in the same proportions in every subject or not. The question is not simple. 
On the one hand, I agree with the statement, that every person, male or female, deserves full life and joy , good education and job , a chance to get interesting profession. If everyone thinks so, there will be neither conflicts nor problems.
But on the other hand, talking about universities exactly, there are different situations, when total equality in every subject is mingless. For example, there are some subjects that suit only (with the little exeption) for men. There are not a lot of women who are fond of mathematics or physics.
What is more, there is few number of men, who like humanitarian arts. So, I do not think it will be so clever to accept equal numbers of female and male for such subjects.
To make a conclusion, I can say that gender equality is really necessary thing, and human rights is the most important issue in social life. But when the question of equal number of male and female students for each subject rises, it should be mistreated. University education is the mos individual issue, and students are students regardless of their gender. They just should be smart and clever and study such subjects, that really suit them.

Nowadays, there are different things in which people might be interested and it is not right to divide specializations for men and women. From a previous period of life was saved a believe from people that male get better possition then women. So, we can see it today: most companies holders are men and women usually do work like housekeepers.

More than that, girls never would be a pilot, on this specialization universities don't accept them. It can be seen very rarely a women as a bus driver.

Crime is not only a much easier way for young people if we speak about non-violent crime, but also an act of commiting the crime becomes unaccepted for people.
What is one of the main reasons to commit a crime? Money. People like fast and easy ways to make money, and young people especially. Why work hard on the manufacture if you can just go and sell some drugs or rob someone? And working fair becomes harder and harder for young, especially just graduated, people as they can't find a job that suits them due to the lack of experience. Comparing to that, crime becomes easier.
And it isn't just easier. now, it is more romantic as well! Young people, especially children and teenagers, watch a lot of films where criminals are such said ""cool guys"": rich, loved by women and sometime even acting better, than police itself. Thus the crime doesn't seem as bad anymore, or it might seem bad, but very cool, and young people want to look cool.
What can we do with it? Honestly, not much. It is more of an educative matter, parents and teachers should really teach the children that regardless of how cool it looks or how easy it may be, a crime is always a crime. People shouldn't mistaken crime for a normal thing because ""everyone does it"". If we just keep telling teenagers that crime is what you can get caught for - they wouldn't stop.
Written above is pretty much my position on this problem. We can't fight the crime among the young people directly. People won't stop doing it until they get used from the childhood that crime is bad for no excuses and that is

First of all air transport is the most comfortable way to go somewhere. It is really convenient to buy ticket to air and go to business trip or resorts. Air plane is really fast and it can take people in place that another transport can’t , so laws to reduce the amount of air travel will reduce people freedom too. I think that people should have opportunity to choose any place they want and any transport to get in this place. Socndly, air pollutions can be reduced by the means of science and technology, but not by the reduced flights that lead to problems with transportation. World community can make such planes that will not pollute the atmosphere and will be ecotransport. In that case I think government should spent more money on science. It is clear that progress in ecology in future will be by the means of science. And it is ridiculous to make laws that will make people feel stressed. World community should be cleverer and for the first time while there are no such ecoplanes make not laws but advertisment that will tell people about pollutions that air transport make, maybe some people will choose buses or trains if they understand that serious problem with ecology.

The same picture we can see students who are 26 - 29 years old also study for career. It is 70% and only about 10% for interest.

It is undoubtedly, that such situation affects the relationships between parents and their children. As adults spend a lot of time working, children have not enough time to communicate with them. 
Firstly, we should highlight the reasons why does it happen. Taking into consideration Russia, that we now living in the period of economical crisis. It is getting harder and harder for families to pay for everything: starting from rent, medicine, food and ending with children’s education and leisure time. Trying to cope with economical family problems women often had to work. Trying to give children more, they take from them the most important thing - communication with their parents. For example, parents dream to give their children a present - a journey to Disneyland. To make this dream happen they should work hard and a lot. But their plans may be ruined, because they had not enough time to ask their children whether they wanted this journey or not. 
Moreover, we should not forget to point out situations, when mother decides to go to work not because of the lack of money, but because she needs to show the society her professional skills, needs self realisation. 
These reasons may lead to some serious problems. Firstly, such situation may damage the system of communication between children and parents. For example, when children gets from their parents only money, but no care and support, they may start to consider them to be just “money-givers”. They would not listen to them, would not do anything their parents want without receiving money. More than that, children may be just hurt by the lack of parenting. And it may cause the situation when children simply get angry with their parents and do not want to communicate with them no longer, because they think that their parent do not care about them. 
But it is not the worth that can happen when parents spend too much time on their work and ignore their children. Unfortunately, I know many example, when children who spend their spare time on their own get to know the dark sides of life such as tobacco, alcohol and even drugs. 
All things considered, it is clear that it is a mistake for parents to think that gaining money for their children may replace their love, care and support. Regardless, the whole economical and self realisation problems they should be firstly parents and only then employees.

Even through it's a good way to ?snow?, especially in a democratic country, that men and women have the same rights, I don't think that it would be a good idea to accept both on the some subject.
First of all, every university has its own specialty: technical or humanitarian. It's known, that boys in its majority have the abitities to understand technical sciences, while girls are good at literature, languages and other humanitarian sciences. If government will separate students and violate their right to choose their own profession. The world will see bad musicians with great abilities to cook well, awful doctors without opportunities to become a painter as he wished in a childhood.
Secondly, such a totalitarian separation will not give any chance to student to graduate to another subject if there is a certain number of people. Such a group would be really hard to sort just because to the the gender issue of each city. It means that the number of students can be decreased or increased for a long period of time until the amount of male and female becomes equal. 
All in all, I think that it's not an appropriate idea to let the equal number of men and women graduate University. Students should have the right to choose subject not by the number, but by their interest. When government make such restrictions, it chooses the totalitarian way to control people activity. And I think it's wrong.

It is a common knowledge that man’s activity damages our planet a lot. All factories, gases, transports lead to unchangeable and global consequnces, but it also makes our life better, our travels more comgotrable and faster. Refusing from it would not be a solution of all problems we have on Earth. It just remides refuse from technical development and back to the past. Today we allow government to control our flights to reduce the risk, tomorrow they won’t order to build houses and cars by hands and after tomorrow they would say we must ride the horses instead of vehicles. I believe that more regulation from government in private life would not solve the global problem, but create another. Secondly, air pollution and global warming is concerning for everyone, not only for politics and not only them have a power. Sewing our environment is an exellent purpose which needs everyone to be involved. Not use achols, drive eco cars are eco friendly cars, grow more plats and trees around your home, find alternative sources of energy and using solar energy are things we could do. Build houses from natural thing for as to do. It does not require something special from people. All we need is just to want save our planet.

Some people think, that it would be fair to ban sportsmen, who use steroids, for not very long period. Other says, that there is only one justies: ban this athlet in professional sport permamently.
On the one hand, it is honestly to ban athlet from sport for not very long period, because time for professional is very matter, so 2 years can cost for him as 20 years. Moreover, if person cheated and than caught, it is not very significant how many years he will be banned, because for all people he will be cheater forever. For instance, professional boxer John Jones, who was caught in 2016 for using steroids now for most people and his fans is only cheater.
On the other hand, athletes who use illegal drugs to improve their results in sport should be punished more strict, than, for example, 2 years. Furthermore, they should be not only banned, but they must excluded from all sport's salaries and his or her own achievments in sport. For example, teammate of Usein Bolt, which was caught by using illegal drugs was not only bannes, but excluded from gold medal, which he received in 2004 year.
In my opinion, the person who was caught by using steroids must be banned at least for 5 years. I think it is fair punishment for crime, like this. At the same time, I believe, that all people which were caught should be put under research of special comission, because sometimes, sportsmen's haters can put some drugs in his food or water. So, it is reasonable to say, that, comission should find them, who did this crime. I cant deny an admirable idea to ban cheaters from sport for the rest of their lives, but I think, it is too crusial to do it, because it can be a mistake.

On the right hand, everyone can make mistake and choose incorrected way. The ban for several years it's a good lesson and leave a chance for sportsmens to start a new life without mistakes from past. It's important because sometimes using illegal drugs is not own athlete's decision. In history was times when sportsmen was pressed by his trainers. They makes this athletes to choose drugs. On the other hand the ban from sports for the rest of sportsmen's lifes is a justice decision because using drugs can change their bodies forever. and sportsmens never able to ready for fair competitions.

It is obvious that also there are many reasons why they do it.
I am absolutely convinced that youth are growing without paying attention to their parents and also teachers. Moreover, children are not getting social and emotional knowledge at their schools. It is one of the main factors to increase crime among youth. Secondly, action movies with murders and robberies are popular amongst youth. It can be clearly seen that these sorts of movies lead to an increase in crime among teenagers as they try to copy what they have seen in the movies.  Furthermore, films have an important influence on young people who are influenced both by what they watch and hear.
To solve this problem a number of actions needs to be made. First of all, parents should know what their children do. Educational talks in a friendly atmosphere will help parents and children to be closer. To my mind, children until they are 18 shouldn`t be allowed to watch action films and games.
Also in schools teachers should know which interests pupils have. The behavior also can say a lot. If they notice children are aggressive and disobedient, they should inform parents.

There are several opinions on this issue. On the one hand, it is believed that there is no matter in acceptance of such kind of equality. On the other hand, it is considered that these changes should be obligatary accepted.
To begin with, I am in favour of such point of view that there is no neccesity in the establishing of this rules. Firstly, every knowledge and skills are developped by everyone individually withought separation in the base of gender. What I mean is that there is no difference if you are a man or a woman , your self development will be formed according to your individual features. For instance, professor A. Grigoriev has written in his book ""Differences in development according to the sex"", that there are obvious differences between men's and women's development but it may be caused only by their attitude. Taking it into account, it will be a wrongful decision, if it is decided to organise such equalty. One more example of the wrongfulness of this position is an interview which was published in October in 2012 in the newspaper ""Comsomolskaya Pravda"". According to this social interview , there were formed different classification of fields in which male and female are interested. For example, man are interested in hunting or cars' repairing and women are interested in cooking and teaching, So, the establishing such equalities in universities will not give an opportunity to a huge amount of people to do the things they want to do.
However, there are people who oppese this opinion. Such people are usually try to fight for the rights of the certain gender. Unfortunately, in this fight they sometimes forget that their ideas can be rather stupid, unneccessary and unnormal. Although it is very sagnificant to defende your rights, such type of changes in universities are unnecessary. According to the statistic presented by ITMO, who has such situation on the faculty of economics a lot of people lost their study places due to this experiment and as a resulted only few students who studied in these groups were satisfied with such situation. In conclusion, to my mind making such equality will be a wrongful decision because there is no matter whether you are male of female , a university should educate you withough such separation. However, this topic is still very controversial.

So, the controversial question whether it is necessary to reduce the usage of plane travel appears. It goes without saying that air transport is a leader in the sphere of convenience and speed. It is popular for both business and leisure travelling as busy people have a need to move fast around the world, and people going to have a rest et a widen range of places to go and discover. Moreover, airplanes provide possibilities to cheap travelling. Therefore such kind of transport can give an access to the easy mooving for different social groups. For instance, the new tendency, low cost companies, becomes more and more popular, as not everybody can afford to buy expensive tickets. It is worth saying that there are worse and much more dangerous things, causing air pollution and global warming. So, if people started to use environmental friendly scooters or bikes instead of cars, the impact of air travelling would not tend so awful. In addition to that, governments should rather pay attention to factories that produce gases, and make the filtration and clean system obligatory to settle. However it is ridiculous to deny that everything should stay in harmony. I mean that despite the fact that I consider law reduction of amount of air travel quite useless, there is a need to control this point.

Consequently, their kids tend to spend less time with mothers and fathers. No doubt, with an increasing popularity of feminism, gender roles start to change. Women are no longer seen as people who are capable of childcare only. Nowadays, more and more of them can express themselves beside housekeeping. This is the reason for most kids to go to the kinder garden from early age. As a result, it’s not possible to spend with their mothers as much time as they did before. My family is an example for this statement: both of my parents decided to have a career, so my brother and I cherished every chance to have a vacation all together or simply go to the theatre in the evenings. Another reason is that in current economic state the only working parent is simple not enough to ‘feed’ the whole family. I order to let a father have more free time, his wife chooses to find a position in a company for herself. Then he doesn’t need to take on more responsibilities at his job. My uncle had had two jobs before my aunt started to send over her CV to a number of companies. Living in a big city costs a lot. It’s better to share some duties for parents to bear the burden together. In this situation, their children spend less time with them. This can cause such problems as not having enough time to develop a character in  your own child, giving away your own chance to raise a kid to someone else. For example, a lot of young girls are offered a position of mannies to help families look after children. There are some kindergardens that provide nighttime care for kids. Nothing can be compared to your own parents, the situations needs change.

I belive the reasons for that are not only in student behaviour, but in teachers’ programs either and the both sides have no solve the problem. 

In my opinion, teachers do not do their job honestly today, because they rely on modern technologies and the Internet where pupils can find all the information they need. Thus, they forgot what proper teaching means and treat students in a wrong way.

However, students also have to be blamed. Most of them believe that they are grown-up and know everything, because any information is available on the WWW. So, they do not do their homework properly and rely on reading the materials in class while the teachers ask them. Therefore, they do not understand the theme of the lesson properly, become anxious and cruel and forget all the rules of a polite conversation.

The last reason to say is that no one today speaks on the topics about politness and intelligence which are very important. As a result, pupils today know a lot about the society and environmental problems, but their knowledge of simple rules of a polite attitude towards grown-up persons is very poor. 

Nevertheless, I belive there are some simple solutions to solve all these problems. Firstly, teachers should not rely just on the modern sources of information and spend more time on teaching the pupils, themselves. Secondly, parents have to pay more attention to the conditions and ways their child is growing up. Finally, there must be some classes devoted to the rules of behavior of students at school to ensure them that these rules are very important.

In conclusion, I would like to stress that problems with student behavior are the results of parents’ and teachers’ mistakes. However, their cooperation to solve the problems will lead to the better results which they can imagine.

Somebody think, that the food producing in any thing country need to it’s population only and omport food must gets as little attention as possible. In this article I try to discuss this problem from every sides and give argument for my opinion.

First, there are many countries have small part of worlds resourses and food ground for selection of different cultures, vegetables and fruits. They can not produce enough food to their own population, but they have another resourses, that they can sell on the world market and for his money have able to buy the foods. In our days it is very popular problem of Afroca’s republics and north countries, for example. 

Second, I think, that population don’t want to wat saim food every day, if it is greatest testy food in the world. People’s organism needs to get large number of health vitamins from different vegotables and fruits, that growth in another parts of the world. Of course somebody can fly to weekends to another parts of the world, but many people have not this ability. So it is very necessary have acses to import food as soon as to own.

In conclusion I would say that I disagree with this point, because verybody must have different kind of food from different parts of the world. This food have own vitamins.

I totally agree with the idea of introducing a new legislation. This essay will look on some points of this view. It has been assumed that nowadays the issue of global warming is becoming an acute problem and governments and international organisations tend to resolve this problem by introducing some effective rules. I have long held that the main helpful way to prevent air pollution and global warming is to cut a great deal of air travel. For instance government should attribute to the air companies to reduce significantly the number of flights in order to make air far more fresh and cleaner. Additionaly, the government and international organization such as United Nation Organization should act in effective way wich will encourage people to be law-abiding and as a consequence to follow rules wich will help us to protect our environmental and reduce air pollution. The way forward might be to introduce the law which will allow people to travel only ones a month. Personally speaking, this rule could help to save our planet from a big number of future’s problems and will encourage people to carry about the place where they live and brith in order to being healthy and in a good stay of life.

These problems are not identical for all people, but it is possible to name some of the most important, because it is essential to find ways to reduce bad influence of modern technologies on people's well-being.
First of all, working with computers, smartphones and laptops for a few hours may cause problems with the eyesight. Nowadays many children have to use glasses due to the fact that spend a lot of time in the front of the different monitors. Their parents may worry about it and try to reduce the time or interest of their children in such kind of the relaxation. On the other hand, some parents prefer to buy special glasses which should be used only while people are working with computer or reading. This method may minimalize bad impact of using these technologies.
Second, there is a possible health problem in the using social networks by young people. The majority of teenagers underestimate the negative consequences of living in the virtual world. Some children and teenagers are likely to forget about the right day regim when they are chating with their friends, for instance. They sleep for 4-6 hours, do not walk outdoors enough and it results in their well-being.

Moreover, scientists and even everage people may try to improve this situation or find an alternative ways of using technologies, which make less harm to the health of the nations.

My essay will discuss why pirating is bad for musicians and film producers and how copyrighters are trying to fight with illegal copying.
As have been already mentioned the illegal pirate copies are a big problem for profit of artis, but also it harry their popularity and digrity. We have seen a lot of cases, when the album or film comes out earlier in the internet than in theaters or in the shops. Artists make a lot of work to make their pieces look perfect and a marketing campaign, which is closely connected to dates when something comes out, plays a vital role. A good example of this is illegal release of the final episode of the BBC’s drama “Sherlock”. The creators had a lot of problems with preventing spoilers for the big audience.
Copyrighters of course try to fight with this problem. The most obvious way is to create laws, which make copying illegal, but it is hard to find the criminal and to punish him. The other way is to create good incentives and environment for people to not to use pirate copies. Such services as Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are a really good example. They give users an opportunity to listen legal music for a small month fee, which is affordable for the most of the people.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that society should help policy makers to prevent pirating. If every citizen will think about illegal sharing as a crime, the copying and pirating will be a big shame and no one will do this.

In the result producers and musicians do not get the whole profit. That is why governments support them and the police catch “pirates” and “downloaders”.
In my opinion these laws are essential to support people rights and work. Firstly, pirates sell copies and get part of creators’ profit. It means that they steal someone’s work which can be considered as theft. Secondly, pirates and downloaders do not respect others’ work. Finally, people usually offer bad quality copies which can badly impress audience and they will not get true emotions and feelings.
Some people may argue that it is more convinient to watch films or listen songs and melodies at home using their own devices. Also it is a great opportunity to download files on gadgets and to have an access to it at any time.
These people forget that there is also a possibility to buy legal discs which they can play at home or buy a special right to watch or listen whatever they want on websites. Then they will have high quality product and will respect producers and musicians. Also they can spend their free time with someone going to concerts or to the cinema and then get more excited.
To conclude, copying and downloading pirate copies have to be considered as breaking law. We all should respect and support producers’ and musicians’ rights and work.

We still face discrimination between men and female in various spheres: it is particularly true for the education. Although I am convinced that manicind cannot tolerate with discrimination between genders, I suppose, that setting up the equal numbers of male and female in every subject is incorrect , because this approach would not take info account some important conditious and will lead to greater discrimination.
Throughout the history there has always been some subjects that appealed mostly males, while another disciplines were attractive mainly for females. History shows that while the men were involved in math or technical disciplines the women are mostly involved in art. For instance, according to the statistics in Saint-Perersburg, State unuversity on the Programme Engineering faculty, the number of male students in much more than female student number. 
Moreover, this order no doubt will be unfair. It would humiliate than rights of both gender's. For instance, if there is only two girls would like to go enter math faculty it means that only two boys can learn math despite on other pretendends desiring to enter this faculty.
Otherwise, if only three boys would decide to enter Foreign language department it  would mean that only three places would be available for girls in spite of total number of empty places.
In conclusion, I believe that we should struggle with discrimination. Setting numbers like this is not efficient and unfair.

One of the biggest problem for our health is that modern technologies make our life easier and more simple, that is why people started to have less activity. For example if we want to meet our friends and speak with them, just for fan, we will call them by phone or skype or something like that. But we lose the opportunity to go for a walk with them. Moreover, modern technologies allwed us to sit on one place and do everything we want or we need. With this reason, people become lazy, and fat. These arguments provide people's illnesses. For example overweight. This kind of illness makes people very unactive.
Another health problem which is the result of influence of modern technologies is a problem with eyers. People started watch their phomes, TV's, computers too much.
But with the help of modern technologies, people can solve these problems with health. Technologies develop in medicine sphere, that is why people started to live longer and happier.

Nowadays each man can commit quick movements wherever he wants thanks for cars, trains and especially plans. Nevertheless, air transport demands a lot of resourses from the Earth, dramatically interfering its environment. Whether the main world governments ought to take certain measures to decrease the amount of flights related to business and leisure is a controversial issue worth discussing.
There is a group of people, which can be named environmentfriendly, that believes that the main reason causes air pollution is air transport because of its harm influence on the atmosphere. To begin with, the common researches give a graph illustrating the way of global warming. According these researches, all types of transport contribute to the ecological disaster; the main culprit is a plane. Moreover, every flight produce such a big amount of carbon dioxide that can be only produced by hundred of automobiles. The building of planes doesn't solve the most important problem of the Earth which threatens our existense. So why we continue to construct more ones? In addition, flights committed are generaly not very essential, because our ecologu does not have to suffer from someone's business desires.
Other people claim that it is undoubtedly exellent to understand that each point of the map can be achieved in a few time by simle using of a plan. Hence the special laws putting limit on this type of transport are not necessary at all. Firstly, sometimes we need to move from one country to another in a very mobile way, because of several reasons. A plan represent a good tool for such task. Secondly, air transport can even simplify the exchange of knowledge. In its turn, it may helps people to make new science and art achievments.
Overall, despite all benefits of flights the level of air pollution and global warming don't cease to increase. Personally, i think that we are able to alter this system and upgrade it. Hopefully, in the future people will put more attention to the environment issue and will try to forget about their private interest in favour the Earth.",70,2,2

First of all, air planes as a transport and infrastructure create a new possibilities to world and local economies, so if government reduce the amount of air travel the gross domestic product decrease and social weltane become lower.

There are several major reasons that cause such tendency. This essay is aimed to reveal causes and give some solutions to overcome the problem.

First of all, many researches proved that there are high rates of crime nowadays due to the fact that younger people commit crimes. It is told that many of them were born and live in the areas where a burglary or even a murdery are everyday things. These teenagers originate from families where there are only one parent or parents work hard to bring up children so breadgivers do not have that much time to spend with their own children. It could be suggested to parents to try and find some time to talk more to their children, educate them, discribe them what is allowed to do in the society. Children should be given more attention from parents. For example, supportive talks with children, asking about their lifes, everyday dinner together can help to change the situation for the better.

Secondly, the moral values of modern society have changed. It became a commom thing among teenagers to do something illegal. One thing that can be done to solve the problem is to pay more attention to this problem at school. For instance, teachers can give lectures about the drawbacks and outcomes of commiting a crime where they will explain to the youth everything. Moreover, more literature with positive and apprecheated life examples can be read during the lessons.

To conclude, it can be said that regardless of differnt reasons of crimes we should start doing something to prevent new crimes. Personally I suppose that combining both of these methods will give the best result and have a real influence on what the younger generation considers to be right.",70,2,0

The main trend is that women are more engaged in “facebooking” and they value each activity more than men but receiving updates has same importance for both gendering.

In many developing countries a huge diversity of small local companies are being displased by the multinational brends. In my eassay I would like to found out whether it has some benefits or not.
On the one hand, we have a vivid disadvantage is that our products will be much more expensive when we will have only big companies. The situation on the market will be very awful because of the monopoly such as we will have only big companies with the same goods and companies that have to make some profit and it wont be successful without small companies.As the result, the owners of big companies will increase the prices of the goods and it will have a bad impact on costumers.
On the other hand, we will have products and goods with the good quality. Multinational brends are very strictly monitor the quality of their productions unlike small companies where it is possible to easily detect the presence of any flaws or defects in goods.
Another bright advantage for having only big companies is that the costumers will have the most diverse range of goods than in small companies.Usually, big multinational companies are located in multi-million territories that allows to offer the buyer a huge number of possible options for one product.It can be of different colors, shapes.

Turning to the similarities and diffirences between the charts, it is necessary to notice that, as it is obvious from the pics, proportions of some goods are fairly equal to one another. To put it more precisely, manufactured goods transportation accounts for 25 per cent of all goods transported by rail, and, concerning the road type, the percentage is slightly more at 28 per cent. The percentage of transported chemicals is not significant in both cases: that is less than a quarter, 11 per cent and 16 per cent by rail and road respectively. The charts show approximately the same proportion concerning non-metallic minerals, though its level at 13 percent is more in the field of road transportation.
At the same time, the differences between some goods numbers are much more significant that that of previous ones. For instance, food products are transported predominantly by road transport units (30 per cent), whereas its number concerning rail transport accounts for 11 per cent. The gap between the percentage of transported machinery is also relatively considerable: it accounts for 12 per cent in the case of rail transportation and for 2 per cent concerning road one.Rail transport units are used more frequently as far as metals are concerned: it is 35 per cent comparing to 11 per cent respectively.

This essay states some examples of that diseases, explains the reasons of their appearance and give recommendation how to decrease the negative influence of modern technology. 

To begin this talk about problems caused by technologies, the ecology must be reminded. Today science has plenty of studies how to improve ecology and care about it, but harmful technologies still used and appear again. Also modern gadgets are weaking the human’s eyes, headphones – their hearing, microwaves, which are going from every electronic machine, destroy neurosystem and cardiosystem of our body. Technologies also sets modern lifestyle, whice remains sitting work or running fast and eat unhealthy food, Of course cars are one of  the from prospects of modern technology, and they often became a reason of deads in car encidents. 

In that case the reasonable question “what can we do?” must be answered. I think the positive effect of modernization is less than described above negative effects. Not only physical health are weakened, our principles and values were changed and cursed. We must return to our traditions, and which is most significant – to our religion. It is a spiritual state, it is that united thing, which we must protect, because if we lost it, our society will be defeated. 

To sum up, we could not developing without problems and it is too difficult to reduce it, so we should stop and go back to traditions and to church. It is not the only correct decision, but it should work if we scared to developing by side negative effects which could appear.

There is no doubt that it is an enormous harm to our nature and I dare say that to some degree air travel should be limited. Lets delve a little bit deeper on this issie. 
  Firstly, according to research by scientists, wich claim that it will be hard to breath without special equipment within 120 years on our planet, government should take immedeate actions to solve this problem, in particular, make a limit for it's own country for air flights per year, because air transport is the most polluting way of travel in comparison with other ways of transport.
  Secondly, people who have money and power take their own private airplanee only because of comfort, and they travel by their own with pilots, not wish stending the fact that such plain cun tuke hundreds of people. And that is why goverment should make a threshhold of people per cur plane. It will sufficiently stop the pollution.
  However, if we look at opposite arguments we will see that to some extent air travel can come in a handy. I dare say that some professions should be allowed to use air transport. For instance, there should not be any ban for doctors that use airplanes in order to help people because it is  the question about life and death.
  In inference it should be mentioned that some laws for reducing the usage of air travel for business and leisure must be developed by goverment. But they must take into account all exceptations.

First of all, there are some arguments against this point of view. Firstly, a lot of people just do not have so much money to pay for every disc with new song or film and the only solution for them is to download pirate copies. Secondly, practicies can be beneficial for musician: information about him or her, his song are spread through the internet and his popularity grows up.

However, there are some people who agree with this opinion and believe that punishement for downloading pirate copies should be.

Secondly, pirate copies usually have bad quality and viruses inside them, which can lead to breakaning computers and stealing money and personal information. Thirdly, if one does not know the laws it does not mean that he should be considered as innocent.

Women more prefer to share photos and videos, about 54 percent, and see different attractive posts, about 43 percent while only the mean 36 percent of men use Facebook for the same reason.  Similarly, more womem about 35 percent learn about ways to help others, menwhile only 25 percent of men pay attention on that.  All in all, after analyzing the information below it can be said that the same number of men and women use Facebook in order to receive updates, 39 percent respectively. ",65,1,1

Some of them learn hard in the universities and work hard in the government to answer this question. Watching these people provide us information about lots of process and producing food for population and import with export is one of them. 

I can agree with statement that countries need to produce the food that their own population eats  and should aim to import as little as possible. But there is one more obvious thing here. I think it is clear for us that producing the food more that their population eats is better way for countries. That is my own opinion. 

It is easy to understand that it is excellent way to give food to all your population. There are some reasons. For example, workplaces in food industry. If you want to produce more food you need more resources and workers. That solve another problem, which called unemployed. Second reason is economical and food stability, when other countries have less influence to out country and it gives us something like shield. 

Second and the last point of my view is ‘import and export’. My version of organization food politics is decreasing import as possible and increasing export. What does it mean? Decreasing import gives us safe and stable future, where country can avoid global economical problem. On the other side, export gives country money (not only that because gold is the way too) and make the nation rich. By the way we should avoid corruption.

First of all, we can see that men in 1999 dominated on women on such bar charts as the skilled vocational diploma (the percent of men is 9 times bigger than women), postgraduate diploma (the percent of women is a half of mens percentage) and master's degree diploma. Thus, there is a tendency that in 1999 most of men have low-educational diploma or top-educational (as master's degree, for example) compared to women results.
Secondly, there is an another tendency - most of women prefered to take the undergraduate diploma or the bachelor's degree: 70 percent against 37 percent approximately and 53 percent approximately against 48 percents approximately. Therefore, women prefered to finish ""middle-level"" education, and did not take part in other qualifications as men.

In this essay I will try to explain the reasons for the enchancement of offence rate and offer some solutions.
To begin with, I sould say that in most countries some youngsters can't find a good job.
In some deprieved countries the government is not able to generate job places for residents and when people can't find any duty to do they try to get money by other ways such as crime. They shoould keep their family with all the essentials and urgent things but they don't have money for that.
Thereby, people and especially the young try to make a fortune with illegal things like drug abuse or burglary and offences.

What is more, the teenagers are too prone to commit a crime because of their friends who may inffluence on them.
Furthemore, some teens don't last their education due to some problems such as family issues. Instead of being at schoold they wander during the day in streets with their peers and when they do not have money to buy what they want , teens think about robbery or other staling offences.
These all facts lead to commiting a crime.


There are possible solutions to tackle with this problem.The government and parents should do accurate thing for youngsters. The government has to create job places where young people can do something to earn money. In terms of parent's duty they must be friend of their children and assist their kids to solve their problmes and always stand by them. At schools teachers also should try to help students when it comes to different issues.

To sum everything up I should say that lack of social and educational knowledge are one of the main factos which can increase crime among young children and everything is in the hands of parents,teachers and government as well.",70,2,0

But is it as unnececesary, as they think?

The space exploration begins in 1950 and it was a huge step for the humanity. A lot of tecnologies such as concentrated food and video conversations were firstly developed for space exploration and nowadays they are used everywere. Consequently, a lot of modern vays of communication became possible only when scientist invented the artificial satelites. For instance, the GPS-navigation became possible only when all this satelites were sent into the space.

With the developpement of space exploration humans have send a lot of junk in the space. Our planet is surrounded by broken satelites, rockets etc. But this problem can be solved with the invention of the multi-use rockets by Elon Musk. The gases that are prodused when the rocket fuel burns are also very dangerous for the environement, and in the procces of building a rocket base a lot of trees were destroyed. For example, when the famous rocket base Boykonur were build, a lot of forests were destroyed.

In my opinion, the governement could spend even more money on space exploration by hepling the private developpements such as Elon Musk program.",70,2,0

Moreover, planes help businessmen to cross the ocean in couple of hourse and make some decision with company partners faster than it was couple hundreds years ago. Air travel also helps us to go to our families and friends in different countries wherever we want. We don't wait to special plane for hours or even days, we just buy the ticket and go to the airport. Planes are the avaible, comfortable and simple way to do all these things.

On the one hand, people will become healthier if they do sports. Sport activities make our body healthy and nice looking. It cannot be denied that nowadays less and less people are interested in sport. First of all it happens because of increasing of alternative ways of time spanding and high prices at different sport sections. For example, in my native town there are very few places where you can do sports, but there a big deal of cinemas, department stores and so on. That is why we have little number of health persons. If you want to do some sport you need a lot of money. On the other hand, our environment influence on our health very much. Today people live in huge industrial cities with polluted air and water. There is no doubt that the Earth is becomming dangerous for people, because they cause a great many of ecological disasters.

Although not every young person is supposed to commite a crime, the vast majority of them could overcome their normal behaviour and make something illigal.

There are a lot of reasons for having such ""crime"" behavior and here are some of them. Firstly, the atmosphere in a family plays a very importamt role as children who feel themselves in love and safe have less persantage to be in proson than those who have abnormal families with drug addictions, for example. Secondly, The relatives cannot prevernt their children from everything. That is why, friends have also such influence. It is obvious that young people from bad families try to gather because they have a lot im common.This coloboration can lead to uncontrollable actions that can also become illigal. The third cause is connected with the emotional state of a child. Basically, it can be caused by something dangerous that have happened earlier.

However, every issue is possible to be prevented with the help of parents and teacher. It is normal when in some countries there are some courses for teenagers in order to overcome their mental problems. Shcool is the second home. so tearchers can influence on children by talking to them. Relatives, in their order, should take more care of their children and controll them.

There was a substantive decrease in the number of boys and girls who are not accessed to primary school in Africa from almost 45 millions to less higher than 32 millions of people.

Furthermore, it can lead to better income and, of course, better life in these areas. However, there is another big advantage of such activity – it is cheap work force.

There are pros and cons of such methods, wich is about to be discussed in the essay. On the one hand, such option seem to be extremely beneficial, since workers in developing countries require much lower wages. The cost of living and running business in poorly developed countries are significantly low in comparison with developed countries as well. For instance, the average employee in USA or Europian countries get much higher salaries than in most African regions. Therefore for such industries which do not need intellectual resources  such as cloth or cotton production, it would be the most profitable solution. Nevertheless, there also might be several problems which international companies is about to face in case they intend to set their production in developing countries. Firstly, some regions, for example Asian ones, have absolutely different working and running business habits. For example, the relationship between an employer and an employee are vary from country to country. That is why international companies will have to adopt to such conditions. If they want to success. Secondly, time is dynamic and as the economic development of a country is taking place, the salaries are about to increase as well. In this case the adventure international companies used to have may decline or disapper. The example of such phenomenon might be Singapore, which, used to have extremely low wages in 1970-s, but as time went by and the general economic situation improved, the beneficial attribute of getting business there had been last by international producers. In conclusion, the tendency of moving business to developing countries is about to decrease, since nowadays the most demanded human resources are those who use well-educated and specialists in areas they work in. as for mostly illiteral developing countries’ workes, they are only able to do simple, mechanic works, wich is less demand in today’s world of information and technology. Therefore moving production into such areas losts its popularity.

So, I absolutely disagree with this statement. 
First of all, it is economically ineffective or even harmful for both universities and government. By this I mean, that the extra-places (for example, for female) need extrafunding and need a long period of time to be included into the educational system of the university. As an example we can take Sweden or other Northern social – democracies that pay too much money for the equity of every person in the university and sometimes it hurts the full educational process and the problem of funding of some educational spheres in this countries is really striking. 
Secondly, there is no eviolence that these measures can’ solve the problem of the lack of education and work efficiency are not so many good female specialists in some spheres, for example in physics, and people that stand for the equal number of places for men and women in the universities believe that this is the only reason of such dissonance. However, we tend to think that they are partically right, there are many examples, in the USA , where the society is tolerant and wants both men and women to have equal opportunities to occupy the working place and to get all benefits from if, many , women choose the path of mechanicse or work in fire department. The fact is, that according to the special researchers, women, who work on the «traditionally men’s job» are two times as little motivated as men on the same position and their efficiency is obviously lower. 
Finally, I believe that the policy of equal member of places of the university can make obsolete all the tryings of the society to make the education free, open and equal. In other words, when the universities are made to create a limitation for this or that sex, because they have the lack of male or female students, that leads the modern world to the times of elitist schools and the colonial school system. These examples are not strange: the situation of the creation of limitations in the XVIII – XIX centuries because of the existing of the schools for «reach boys only» lead to the social revolution at the beginning of the XX century that gave a life to the modern equal school and university for both men and women. So, should the government and the university create new barriers for really talented students only because of the policy of gender tolerance? 
Taking everything into consideration, it is worth saying that the plan to make equal the number of male and female students in all subjects is neither effective nor cheap. The government will be forced to pay for students who have nor motivation neigher ability (including physical) to do their best on the future working place. Moreover, these measures are not legitimate and lawful, as they violate the basic right of the person to realize his/her knowledge or talent on the place that he/her have already chosen for future education or work.

It is a popular belief that people who do not purchase original DVDs and albums are criminals and should be punished. I partly agree with this opinion. This essay will analyze problem from the different points of view.
To begin, it goes without saying that creators of music and films lose their money because of pirate copies. For example, film producers spend money on new film comparing expected costs with expected revenues to gain the largest profit. However, just after the release of new film somebody copies it and wide audience has an opportunity to watch it free. The same situation is with new musical albums. In this case film producers do not gain enough money just to cover expenses. To prevent such occasions a large number of governments publish laws which prohibit illegal pirate copies. It is believed that it can solve the problem by punishments of those people who copy the film or album which has not got enough money. Such strict measures are also apprepriate for films which can be watched in the cinemas. If potential watchers have an opportunity to watch film at home, cinemas and film producers will lose huge amounts of money. Thus, people who try to copy and share new products just after its publishment should be punished.
However, if film or musical album was published several years ago, watching it or listening to it for free should not be considered as a crime. When cinemas and film makers gain all possible money, famous films and not only films should be available for wide audience. Undoubtedly, spreading of films and music will improve ranking of film makers and musicians as more people will be allowed to estimate it. Apparently, the most successful musicians and actors are those who are famous among worldwide audience. This success could be achieved by copying and sharing music or films on the internet.
To conclude, it can be said that illegal pirate copies may be regarded differently. On the one hand, they lead to great loses of money. Nevertheless, on the other hand, it allows to make musicians and film makers more famous.

Downloading music and film from the Internet without paying is a widespread issue these days. As far I am concerned, that is not a crucial theft, which is worth punishing by law.

In the first place, buying original products of music and cinema spheres is not a cheap pleasure for a lot of people. For instance, average person watches films for 3-4 times a week, which means he or she would spend on it amount money, equal to 2 dinners, if he/she would do it at cinema.What is more, downloading content from the World Wide Net saves not only money, but also time. It is essential that “pirates” do not need to go and look for discs, but it takes a second to press “download” on the website.

In addition to this, it must be said that pirating could only be a benefit for musicians and producers due to a significant reason. When somebody really enjoy a film or a song/composition of an exact creator, he or she would love to watch a film of this producer on a big cinema’s screen or buy a music disc as a present.

On the other hand, oppenents of this point of view argue that producers lose a lot of money. However, it is my belief that they take more amounts than lose.

Taking everything into account, there is no absolute answer to this question, but I strongly believe that it should not be punished by governments and has more benefits for the both sides of action than drawbacks.

It leads to difficult consequances with our health. We breath such air and get some illnesses such a way. Moreover, air pollution leads to that plants die and if the economy related to the sale of agriculture it may be effect on this country: it would become poor.
However, on the other hand, we cannot do without flights by plains because, for instance, some people have some family members in other countries whom they want to see and visit each other. Besides, some people fly by plain to work in other countries. Some of them have their business throughout. Such a way, they cannot find other ways to go to these places.
In conclusion, it should say that the amount of air travel for business and leisure should reduce. However, it is impossible to realise because we cannot limit people in their desire. Moreover, we should have connection with other countries because of getting knowledge of cultures, for example.

There are some suggestions of the ways of its improving, and one of them is increasing the number of sport facilities. However, there are some doubts that this would actually work.
On the one hand, there are a lot of advantages of developing sport facilities. Unfortunately, a lot of citizens can hardly find a football or basketball pitch in their neighbourhood. That leads to unnecessary wasting of time on the way to sport facilities that could even prevent people from visiting them. And increasing the number of these facilities would solve this problem. What is more, some people who were not interested in  sports earlier may find doing sports really attractive for them in case of sports facilities growing number.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this solution too. There are no proovs that the construction of new sports facilities would influence people interests. Some people might be bored of all kinds of sports and prefer another ways of spending time. Some people may also disagree with spreading of sport fields because they may need other kinds of facilities. For instance, families with children may worry about the replacement of playgrounds or parks with sports constructions. But this position is arguable because different sports facilities are well-combined within parks or with playgrounds.
To sum it up, there are a lot of pros and cons for building more sports facilities. The main evidence for this solution is the lack of sports constructions and people are not able to do sports. But there are some doubts that this would not only influence public health in a good way, or even may spoil already existing facilities. However, these concerns are not actually truthful and increasing number of sport fields and other constructions would only change the situation in a better way.

This issue is very complicated and advantages and disadvantages should be discussed. 

It seems to me that lower the import as much as possible is not very good idea in case of several reasons. 

Firstly, the country could lose profit from some special sorts of plants or rare animals which could live only on it’s territory. Importing specific sorts of plants, for example, pineapples from Mexico or Brazil, would give them money to country development and also import gives an opportunity for foreigners to try something new 

The last reason is that selling food to other countries would make the financial and political relationships stronger if the leader of the country would prefer to import nothing. 

Anyway, the counteropinion exists and the arguments are also interesting. Some people might say that food import is a evil because in developing countries the economics is not strong enough to sell goods such as food, There may be nothing left for citizens of this country, what may cause the sufferings of people, demonstrations and blooms of violence and aggression, 

One more reason is that in some concrete situations country could not have an opportunity to sell it’s products anywhere abroad, so it will not be helpful at any way to improve a financial situation. 

To conclude with, importing food is very important topic in economical programms of many countries. If an import would not exist we possible may not try so much dishes and would not met the other cultures.

Some of the government introduce more severe laws to punish the criminals, while others try to create more light conditions both in judgment and prison systems. In this essay I am going to spotlight both of them and try to came up my own opinion. From one hand, the main purpose of the law is to prevent people from commiting a crime. Consequently, it is undoubtedly fair that long prison sentences or even death penalties wile scare those who decide to commit a crime however, the practice show that this does not really works, for instance, in USA, where the prison sentences are almost the highest in the world, but the problem of high crime rates is still persisting over there. Furthermore, governments spend a lot of money for detailing prisons and that is what tax-payers citizens a lot. From the other side, there exists a bench of ways to reduce crime that are applied all over the developed countries. Norway prisons are considered of the best in the world and the prison sentences could not be mor than 21 years for men and even less for women in that country. Interestingly, that the crime rates are the lowest thorought the years in that country. The main reasons for applying such a loyal conditions is that prison have to reabilitat criminals rather than punishment and prosecute them. In Spain and significant there exists special program for those, who just quite the prison. Those programs are designed to help to find a good job and reintegrate in the society for those people, who had been isolated from others so long. To sum up, I think that both ways might good for a particular country. However, I believe that society should overpass that period of just prosecuting laws and to came up with more intelligent and humane ones.

There are a lot of reasons that can be grouped into one term – human activity. Atmosphere has been polluted by air travel for the last decade. There are some policies that should regulate and reduce the number of air travel. In my point of view, there is no right to limit people to move all over the world. In this essay will be discussed balanced between ecological problems and human right.

Nowadays we can observe globalization. A lot of people has the Internt to exchange their cultures, views and information. Thus migration has quickly scared for the last years. It became essential part of modern people’s life because of technological progress. I think that government should not regulate human movement because it is not interruption of rights and private life. If government choose groups of people who can travel there would be discrimination for the rest people. In addition, a travel reduce related with business and economic declining.

In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to solve ecological problem. The prime example is to invest to develop alternative ecological sourse. Besides, government can introduce laws to air companies’ standards not to reduce the amount of air travel. In conclusion, I would like to say that the air travel reduce is radical method to solve air pollution problem. As is observed there are more civil alternative ways.

Statistics tell that the number of youngsters who committe crimes are increasing year by year. In my opinion, there are some general causes of this trend and possible sollutions. In my essay I will describe them.

Very often this issue has its roots in deprived childhood and not sheltered upbringing. Sometimes, children are living in bad conditions and do not have enough food and clothes. In such situations, they can try to bring some things from shops and from their friends because they just do not understand why someone has it and they do not. To tackle this problem parents and teachers shold always teach children to be honest, hardworking, kind to reach their goals by hard work and passion, not by crimes. Many young people with deprived childhood and wise upbringing reach success in the future.

However, the problem may stem from a broken home or parents who do not care, too. When parents have conflicts they may divorse, and a child stay with one of the parents. In such situation, a child do not see both parents often because the one who he or she is living with has to work a lot. So, very often parents do not care about the upbringing and teaching of the child. And a young man or girl may meet bad company and no one can tell him or her that it is not right because parents do not care or do not have time for their son or daughter. So this company starts to committe crimes and so does the child and then he is going to prison. And the life is ruined. To tackle this problem, parents should care and not forget about their children education. They should know who are the friends of the child, what they are doing together. And if taechers notice something unusual, thay have to inform parents.

To sum up, nowadays, there are many young criminals, far more than it used to be. There are quite a lot of situations that can lead to crimes commited by children. However, there are many ways to stop this. And the ones who can help children are mostly their own parents and teachers.",75,2,0

However there are people nowadays who think, that any experiences cannot influence our personality, as we are what we were born with. Are they right?
From my point of view experiences have the major influence on our development. We are not only what we were born with, but also what we see, with whom we talk, in what we believe. Firstly, noone is born as a scientist  -- in order to become one, people spend years, reading books and analyzing the information. For instance Eiler spent years learning mathematics, before he become the most famous scientist. It is far easier to say, that you cannot do it because it is impossible, not because you are lazy. Secondly, life experience can really effect or even affect people, whoever you were born, life can break you or make stronger during challenges. Without people conditions development is impossible anyway.
However, there are people who argue, that the charecteristics we are born with are far from important. They say that it did not matter how hard Soliery tried Mozart still was a better musician because he was born with his talent. It is hard to disagree with it, but personally I believe that only a few people are born to be genious, others should do their best to succeed in a occupation that they really enjoy. Soliery was still a really a really good musician, and without his father and everyday excercices Mozart would never become as famous as he is today. So, conditions do matter.

The similar situation is present in other non-English speaking countries. I think that it is provoked by a number of reasons. Firstly, the quality of American and British movies is undoubtfuly higher and people choose the best. Hollywood has a rich history of cinematograph and people there khow how to produce films well and earn money. The technologies there are more developped.
The second reason is that English is an international language and unify people all over the world. Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? We know that Russian government try to support our producers. For example, ""Fond Kino"" gives a lot of money to produce Russian films and I think it is a good way to stimulate Russian film-makers. On the other hand, we can see also persons who получает this finacial support and the films they product. Its quality does not grow (may be the reason is that they want just to earn miney and corruption); producers who have been appreciated by the world (for example, Alexander Sokurov) can not produce their films in Russia and look for other investment. The facts make people disappoint in Russian movies and doubt in justice of fond's decisions, that's why people does not to bring them miney in cinema and just to watch their films. This is the last evident reason of unpopularity of locally produced films.

Some people think that people who copying and sharing music on the Internet should be punished, others disagree with them and believe that there should be a freedom in this case.
People who are for punishing provide rather strong arguments for their position. First of all, they believe that copying and sharing is very harmful for the musicians and it can lead to the bad financial situation of the famous person. They should only sell their products. Secondly, they think that sharing can be considered as the ignorance of the rights of an artist. Because sometimes for example film producers have a plan of how to present their film and if someone share the info about the film before the debut it would be disrespectful for the labour of the film producer.
But there are some people who do not share this point of view. Firstly, they believe that now, when we are living in the post-industrial world we should have the right to copy and share all the information we get. Moreover, they believe that usually when some information about the film shared in the Internet it only has a positive impact on the amount of money which producer get from the film. It help to boost interest in the internet sphere. And finally, they sure that sometimes it is the only way to listen to some new music. or to watch a film because nowadays the price of the cinema ticket is rather high as well as the price of the MP3 disc.
To sum up, there is no correct answers for this kind of questions because it all depends on the attitude of the person. The position of people who are for the freedom of copying and sharing is closer to my attitude.

I do not agree with this statement and and I would like to express my opinion.

The first obvious reason to tend to import more foreign food is the better meal variety of citizens. This factor can lead to better productivity and happiness of average citizen. Moreover most people are open-minded about trying something new in their life and food is no exception. With high posibility this desition, which was stated before, will be supported by anyone. the second reason about importing more food comes from the medical point of view. There is a high posibility that local food does not contain enough minerals and nutrients to supply the body. This may result in problems with health, which lead to higher chance to get ill, reduction of average lifespan and so forth. This is why it is so important to have a wide variety of food available in all supermarkets. Last, but not least argument is that reducing the amount of import will significantly harm the economy. it is clear that this trade between countries would have only positive impact on both countries which participate in it. The foreign seller which perhaps has high supply of his national food, is able to balance it by selling it our country. Our country also has sort of income because buying food from other countries is probably cheaper to produce it by yourself. Thus it is a win-win situation.

Summing up, I would like to mention that lowing production of local food and increasing import of it will no doubt have a positive impact on every single attribute of modern life and can also improve the economy.

In this essay some problems which are related to the issue of violence actions amoug teenagers and a vailable solution will be disscused.

It is claimed that young people have too much free time now. Deffinately, this fact can explane why the rate of violent actions increases. While one group of teenagers have their additional classes of school studies or sport courses, others have nothing to do than use their smartphones and surf at those sites that are forbiden where they can easily learn how to kill. For example, in Russia in last two years a lavel of violence actions and deaths among teenagers has riched its peack: more than 50 percent of people at the age from 15 to 20 were involved in crime and even died.

Actualy, the reason why it is happening is the lack of attention from parents. When a child grows up in a loving family, with normal relationships and ideals, he would never commit a crime. It is neccesary to emphasise, that the government should pay attention on this problem. For instance, additional classes could be made obligatory, some hobby courses could be free for families with no enough income. It could lead not only to a more broad minded generation, but also it could decrease a number of crime actions that are committed by young people.

To summurise everything have been said, some real, forsed and strong actions should be taken. Families should be more attentive to their children and they should try to organise children's spear time in such a way when they would not have time for stupid and violent things.",65,2,1

Others consider that it is not essential.
I completely disagree that equal numbers if male and female students should study in universities. 
First of all, it is evidently that males and females are interested and good in different subjects and areas. For example, men, as usual, are better than women in mathematics and technical subjects. On the other hand, females are better than males in literature and arts. Therefore, the rule of accepting equal numbers of male and female students would be harmful for all society, because a lot of good specialists in their fields would be lost for us.
Secondly, if universities only accepted equal numbers of men and women, it would restrict rights and freedom of citizens. Nowadays rights and freedom of citizens is the main basis of every modern society. Consequently, we can not ignore this aspect.
However, a lot of people believe that it will be better if universities accept equal numbers of males and females, because a lot of scientists say that interaction between males and females is much for social and psyhological development of a person than interaction between only men or between only women. This position is very interesting, but I do not agree with it because interaction between males and females is possible not only during studying in universities, but also going in for sports, taking part in different events…..Therefore, it is not essential for social and psyhological development to accept equal numbers of male and female students.
In conclusion, I would like to say that equal numbers of males and females should not be accepted in every subject by universities.

I think that increasing the number of sports facilities would have really little effect because person should want to go to sport. On the other words, he should have needs at sports, for example, to improve own health, to improve body, to take part in sports activities to win. Nobody can`t make people to take part in sports activities.
Of course, other measures are required. It can be control for children, who adults can give examples of wrong behaviour to. Also we can ban advertising alchohol products and tobacco, and advertise sports games, sports healthy life.
In my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities for that children and teenagers have all opportunities for healthy life.
Generally speaking, the best way to improve public health isn`t only by increasing the number of sports facilities. Society should provide many facilities for itself, for other people, for children. For this reason, a lot different measures are required.

Nevertheless, we can see a tend to decrease for the number of desktop users(from about 150 millions in March 2012 to a little bit more than 130 millions in March 2013) and for mobile users to increase in number(from about 60 millions in March 2012 to almost 100 millions in March 2013). The second figure reveals next tendencies: among women the most important reason for using Facebook is sharing photos and videos: 54% of women thought it was the main reason. For men the reason was as important as receiving updates – the latter was equally important for both men and women(39% for each).

Because, first of all, these international companies give working places for people who have not a diploma of degree, have not experience (young generation) or money.

Workers pollute rivers, cut forests and change the ecosystem of the area where their building located. What is more, the quality of goods.

Society of the whole country started to think about the reasons of rising level of crime among youth. We can name several causes of such development.
Firstly, young adults can be mistreated in their families and deprived of proper health care, sometimes suffering from abuse and neglection. Secondly, modern school education concentrates the most of its effort on learning scientific subjects, but there's no lessons of proper behaviour and ethical attitude to the world. Thirdly, no serious measures are taken against young criminals as they are often viewed as children with no responsibility.
The first thing that can be done to improve the situation is educating the parents about basic needs of their children, such as food, health care, clothes, appreciation at the school class. Awareness can be spread with open and free educational seminars for parents of teenagers and children. The main advantage of such approach is an ability to discuss the topic of child and teenage care with a specialist. Unfortunately, parents who wouldn't attent such meetings can still spread abusive pattens.
In order to solve the second problem we should change the list of the school subjects, adding lessons of ethical and tolerant behaviour in the society. A council of teachers and specialists in the field of school education should deside on the most comfortable and easy way to organise the classes. The positive effect of the classes is improvement of critical thinking skills among young adults, including potential criminals. Unfortunately, the lack of universal behaviour rules and cultural difference can cause arguments and conflicts between teachers and parents
The third key to the problem of youth criminals is adding more severe punishments for the young intruders. Such measures of punishment as life inprisonment and death penalty should be included to the list of measures taken against young people who commited severe murders and caused significant harm. As a result, young people will be afraid of the punishment, having real-life examples in front of their eyes. The main disadvantage of such approach is the negative reaction on fear and vieving such measures as a therror.
In general, young criminals rob houses and commit the murders because of family abuse, lack of education and being sure to recieve no real punishment. In my opinion, the main workon improvement of the situation should be done by parents and teachers by spreading the knowledge and improving relationships between teens and adults.",70,2,1

What is more, North Africa has the biggest unemployment rate, which was the same in 2014 and 2015. The numbers are 12,5 and 12,5. As we see, in a world wide we have the same situation.
The one more thing, that can not be ignored is some important changes in unemployment rate between 2014 and 2015. The first region, which has these changes is Middle East.

There is an opinion that the number of flights should be reduced to prevent environment from pollution. I believe that people should care of this pollution, but not by prohibition of flights, but due to technological progress. The airplanes are very common mean of transport and they are important for business, as there are a lot of places, where people can reach only by the air, e.g. oil deposits in the Syberyia, so, governmnets can just prohibit buseness flights, as some urgen question need immediate considerations, and in such cases businessmen extremely need airplanes. So, it can be said, that such laws will surely cause problems for economy. What about flights for leisure, if government will try to prohibit them, it will face with a problem of identifying the purpose of flight. As people who can afford private jets are usually very affluent and busy, they can say that their flight is on current business affairs, and governments will have to devote a plenty of resources to control this issue and decide whether to prohibit the flight or not. The problem can be solved by reducing taxes for aircompanies and business men who use ecological jets. New models of planes, such as Boeing 787, or Airbus 850 are constructed with the main idea of keeping the environment clean, thee planes almost do not pollute atmosphere, they are very ecological, and if more airlines will use them, there will be no danger for our planet form air transport. Low taxes for companies flying on such jets will faster demand for them and only such planes will be designed and produced in near future. In conclusion, the problem of global warming from pollution is real and people do have to cope with it, but not by imposing such measures as they would not bring any benefits to industry and human society for whom the air travel is very important.

Many people believe that it can be reduced by longer prison sentences. Other people suppose that there are better solutions. Who is right? Most people consider longer prison sentences as a good way of preventing crime. Firstly, many criminals may become afraid of this judgement. Secondly, some of the prisoners commit crime again after going out of a jail, and longer prison sentences will keep them in their cells for much longer time. In addition, they will have a chance to overthink their lives and their attitudes to crime. On the other hand, some people think that is not the best way of solving criminal issue. They suggest alternative methods, such as psychotherapy. Some people believe that even if somebody has become criminal, there is always a way to a normal life, and psychologists are able to help him. The other suggestion is to put criminals to some society- useful works, for instance cleaning streets or building houses. They will make a lot of profit to ordinary people and maybe even like such good and kind deeds. As for me, I suppose that keeping criminals in prisons for a longer time is rather good solution. It does not require any additional payments and can be brought to life immediately. Moreover, it is good way of keeping criminals out of the streets and making our cities safer. To conclude, crime is a serious problem and something should be done with it. Longer prison sentences are very suitable for quick solution and well bring many dividents. However, some other ways should be experimented, because they can be much better in the long run.

The large number of girls usually is in humanitarian subjects, whereas boys prefer technical ones. But should universities accept equal amount of boys and girls?
On the one hand, there are more girls in many countries than boys. If universities make limits for girls , there will be the lack of boys, especially in humanitarian subjects. For example, it is a common tendency, that more girls go for education to the law faculties. My low faculty has a proportion of males and female students nearly 1:3. It has as advantages and disadvantages.
Less boys are interested in low, more girls become judges, lawyers , prosecutors etc.
But if universities limit the quality of girls, entering law faculties , it would be discrimination, usually called 'sexual discrimination', because a lot of girls want to be a lawyer. Also it has a positive effect, girls can become someone else.
To my mind, the best solution of this problem is to stand a specific proportion of male and female students for each faculty. Because some professions lack of boys or girls and not always one kind of work appropriate for that very sex. Of course, there are jobs which must be universal for both males and females, that is why some faculties should make equal numbers of girls and boys.

Statistics show that the number of crimes committed among young people has increased during the latest years. In this essay I will provide some reasons for that fact and variants of how to deal with that.

Firstly, it is clear that the modern generation of teenagers and young people is completely different form what was 20 or 30 years ago. More and more young people come form deprived communities or families with only one parent, many of them are used to violence and home abuse. This fact, obviously, could not reflect on person's upbringing in a positive way. The second reason is connected to the age of technologies. Every day with the help of mass media and social networks we are bombarded with tons of information and news about murders, robbery, car stealing, kidnapping and so on. In my opinion, it could be considered as a propaganda and could have a bad influence on young people's minds and behaviour.

It goes without saying that this problem needs to be solved as the safety of people is on stake. Probably, some measures can take place at schools, for instance, a short course for all the students on a current situation explaining there is no significant reason to become a criminal. The situation with bulling at schools should be taken under control, as well. Additionally, some courses could be organised for parents because they are the ones responsible for their children's upbringing including their mindsets. As far as I am concerned, people who lacked love and care in their childhood are more likely to become criminals. And finally, the government could make a police control and protecting services more strict and more attentive.

To sum everything up, this problem creates the bond between all the people because most of the criminals have no other choice, it is the only way they can survive in a modern world. That is why it is crucial to understand that the criminal issue has more deep roots starting from our society.",65,2,0

At the same time in Italy the part of men and women after 60 is the largest one, but in comparison with the data of 2000 year their quantity will become slightly smaller. Interestingly, that youngers in Italy are just under 15% of population and their percentage continues to lessen.

The latest statistics also claim that young people make up the bulk of criminals. It is evident that this phenomenon has its causes, which should be taken into consideration to deem of appropriate ways to tackle this problem.

The first and the most significant thing that affects existing young criminals statistics is the nurture. Childhood deprived of parental love or uprising in a broken family may form a child's character in a more agressive way. That is why paying attention to childrens' development in an appropriate atmosphere is an essential thing that can be done to prevent them from commiting crimes.
It is not a secret that a lot of youngsters start to do illegal deeds because of the desire to show off and create hype around their personality among their friends. Here both monitoring the closest surrounding and pastime of an adolescent may work as the push for the crime commities to reduce. Permanent teachers' and school psychologists' participance in the life of students should also take its place here to from the their wordviews and life rules in a right way.

To solve the existing problem and make the number of young criminals to plummet, an entertaining alternative should be offered to them. The thing is that many youngsters spend their time on illegal acticities since they have nothing else to do. In this way, local governments may think of some special programs and events for young people to catch their interst and occupy them.

All in all, the problem of increasing number of adolescent criminals is a complex and significant one. To tackle this issue both nuclear family and society in general shouldcooperate and work togeather to turn the process of uprising in a needed way.",65,2,0

As for me, I do not agree with this statment for 100 percents. To my mind, from one hand, producing food makes countries more independant. They do not need to be in good relationships with other countries and depend on their prices on food. Secondly, in this case goverment should not pay extra payments for transfering the food, and it of caurce makes the food much cheaper and available for all people. And finally, this appoach creates thousands of job offers, develops the infrostructure and makes fermers richer. This is very good for countries economics.

But on the other hand, in my opinion, trying not to import at all is not a good desition. I strongly believe that there are always somthing that cannot be planted by a country by itself or it is much cheaper to import this thing. The reasons for import may be different. Some times the strong climate does not allow to grow some kinds of plants or may be it is just impossible to grow enough food for the population of the country.

So, to summ it all up I would like to say that althougn providing the population with food, grown in this country, is very usefull for countries economics and infrostructure, it does not mean that the goverment should try to import as little as possible because sometimes importing something may be more convinient and much cheeper than trying to grove it.

One of them is spending too much time at work, so children are suffering from the lack of time, spent with parents. Why do parents spend less time with their kinds? What will it result in? First of all, parents have to earn more money to live a normal life. As the economic crisis strobe, companies are doing their best to survive, so the workers have to work more hours. However, the cost of living has increased, so that parents have to have not only 1 job, but even more. The third reason might be that people of the millenium generation are putting career goals forward, instead of having a normal family. Lack of interaction with parents might cause some illnesses in kids, such as depression. Moreover, they might suffer from some verbal problems, connected with the amount of chat they do with their parents. However, the worst problem will strike them in the future: they will not be able to perform the mother/father role properly because they will just not know how to do that. This will result in breakups and divorces rates among the adults of the most generation. All in all, the results of such a behaviour of parents might be disasterous for the future. Having all the money problems and your own career goals should more to the backstage once you have a kid. Spending time with kids is as important as going to school and learning how to read. Family is the first place the child get to socialise at, so parents should make sure to do their best in helping their kid with that.

Great companies have been interested in spreading their business to the new places and areas. Today a lot of them try to more some parts of their companies to poor and developing countries for different poses. There are some positive and negative sides of this decision. Moving the business to some poore country could be a good idea. Firstly, company will get new resources. For example, last year one American agricultural company moved one of its parts to some poor country in the South America to get new kind of soil. Secondly, employing of the local workers may help to improve relationships between different countries. For instance, several years age there was a political agreement based on international company relationship between some Asian countries. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of idea to move business to the developing country. First of all, there are might be some problems with government. History knows a lot of case, when activity of some international companies was banned by local government. Moreover, it possible that local people will not anderstand the policity of company and just start to ignore its products. Difficulties with transporting the equipment also could be a reason. There are a lot of examples of unlucky attempts to move the business because of impossibility to transport special cars for example. To sum up, there are a lot of positive and negative sides of moving international company’s business to another poorer and developing country, but some economical, geographical and political research could help these companies.

Due to the fact, that air transport is the fastest one, millions of people prefer it to other ones wherever they go. However, as the plans use a petrol, they cause air polution. This fact have became an argument of scientists, who are struggling with the air transport as a factor of global warming. Plans need a lot of engine to fly, and they burn a lot of petrol to produce such engine. In the result they put huge amount of Carbon Dioxcide into the atmosphere, which can provide a global warming in the recent future. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, our government should create some ways to reduce a number of such travels by introducing special laws. For instance, getting higher taxes for flights will make ticket prices more expensive and some of travelers will prefer plans to other types of transport, such as trains or busses. On the other hand, the biggest part of nowaday’s transport produce as much CO2 as the plans, which makes such measures of struggling with air pollution as reducing number of air flights, not so efficient. If people would prefer to travel by busses, it will cause increasing number of bus travels, which could produce much more CO2 then even plans in the recent future. Eco-transport can solve such problem, but at the moment, the level of technical progress is not on the necessary level to bring such measures into reality.

Doubtless, that air travel is one of the factors of global warming, but not the major one, and if we want to win this fight, we should get a great complex of measures to create a type of a transport, which doesn’t pollute our atmosphere.

These people and their supporters state that onlene piracy must be illegal, and onlene perates must punished by law. 
This essay will discuss, firstly, my point of view on the issue, secondly, several arguments supporting my opinion, and thirdly, conditions under which the problem could be resolved.
To begin with, in my opinion it is illegal to use any sort of pirate copies of any product. I think that every honorable person should avoid using such kind of copies.
Firstly, any kind of labour must be paid. Neither industrial worker nor singer will not do any job or produce any product if he or she does not have money for a flat or house or food.
Secondly, artists or film makers have to be free from problem of earning money for everyday expences in order to be able to produce different pieces of art.
Nevertheless, there must be some conditions under which it will be ethic to call onlene piracy a crime. First of them is that entertainment products should be attainable by the majority of population of a country.
Secondly, it must be easier and more convinient to buy an entertainment product, not to steal it.

On the other hand, such activities as paintings and pictures, writing articles or books should be do according to the laws of the country, because they can destroy the ideas of other people. In addition, bad things should not be showed to children or religion people, for example recently groups of women has sung the song against the government in the church and has destoyed the ideas of religion people, who have been there.

There are nost of people believing that “pirates” who copy and share music, books and films on the internet should be punished rather than people who download this content and use it for free. Personally, I tend to agree with these people because “pirates” harass the author of content and the law.

Not many people agree to work without salary. We all need money to live to eat and to go enywhere.Creators of content are usually foy to live on money from sales of their albums, books, films etc. You cannot write a good song if your family hardly survive. That is why due to illegal copies we lose many singers and writers every year. There are only two options for people struggling to live by their product. The first is “retirement”. people giving up and deny to try again. The second one is part time job which would help with spendings but reduce the quantity of content. Both ways are damaging for culture.

The government usually try to controll the situation and protect producer of content. There are different rules and laws in many countries which accuse of theft somebody who share controversial files. In my opinion, we also should have a legislation which will punish users of pirate copies. Without it we will stay in society where people do not respect the affords of creators. Lots of people now support pirates. They are tollerent to breaking the law by them. It is a dangerous precident for countries at all.

On the other hand, there are less people who illegally download content in rich countries. The people of poorer states usually just can not buy films and books because of high prices. Should they read at all? It is a tough question to answer to.

To sum up, we ought to say that there are two opposite group of people which argue about pirate copies. While some people are tend to approve illegal content others assume that it should be not allowed to use by law.

I strongly insist on punishment for users as well as for pirates. If there are no pirates, country gets more fees and have much more creators who trust the government and people.

However, airplanes are polluting environment which requires response from the government. I partly agree with the propounded government policy of cancelling some unnecessary routes, thinking that we should take into consideration but consequences of such decisions. There is no doubt, that air planes cure harming over environment and sometimes should be made to restrict this negative impact. I think that the government should cancel some lowercost air travellings. These flight are unexpansive and so are less productive. I mean that such planes can carry less passengers and so seem to produce a greater amount of pollution per one passenger. Also I think that some of the local flights can be categorized as unnecessary because of existing alternative tools of transport but not so many local flights should be cancelled if the problem with pollution needs to be solved. I consider that the main problem with cancelling of unnecessary flights is arising when we ask what will happen if the travelers will atilize other means of transport instead of planes. If the journey is long and destination point is for away an attention should by put on the level of pollution produced by another means of transport. Cars, trains and other means are still not green and are contributing to the global warming as well as plaines. For example, if we consider that the passenger who has no opportunity to travel by plain due to the government decision will seat in his car and if we imagine big amount of these passengers. To sum up, I consider that some of the flights should be cancelled by government but not a lot of them. Government should be aware of provoking bigger pollution by alternative means of transport.

Today artists have the freedom, but sometimes government can restrict their ideas. I am convinced that creative artists should not be restricted.
In my opinion, politics and art do not have the same reasons. The function of government is regulation of social, economical and political relationships in society. Art is another world that gives up an opportunity to think and live as we wish in our fantasies.
If creative persons forget their freedom to express their ideas, we will not see the new kinds and trends of art. Modern life is very dynamic, it changes very fast. Yes, we have many wonderful pictures of 18 century, we can listen to classical music and watch old films. But, despite of it, we need more genius compositions.
We know that some of modern songs, films, cartoons and pictures have the signals of revolution. Power afraid of this trend, because modern art can influence the society more then government. Without any doubt, sometimes it can be useful. Power corrupts. Art is indicator of people's opinion, and people can influence government.
Freedom is a criteria of democracy. Democracy is the main idea of modern life, that is why today everybody can express his ideas the way he wants.
But some people have an opposite viewpoint. They sure that modern painters and singers are very free, that is why their expression is ugly and can influence children and polite people bad way. I think that these people are afraid of changes in modern world.
Art is long, life is short, that is why freedom should be the main criteria of modern art, because we need the new ways of expression.

Really, this topic is very popular nowadays, and there are many arguments to right this view.

Firstly, people care their health, because they choose what they buy is shops and what they eat. People should to buy products very carefully and see in what country this product was produce, becouese usually import food is not naturaly becouse to transport food by one country to another people need a long time, but in this time food can’t to be fresh and people to use different chemistry, which very dangerous for health every person and special children. Morover, import food it have highest cost than population eats. It important for many people because they economy their money.

On the other hand, import is a good thing because there are some fruicts and vegetables which very difficult to produce in own population because it depend of climate. In this case countries need to help each others and their aim to import only fresh food. There are people which support this idea to import food not to aim to give money but to aim to have a good or tropic food, with they never can to produce in their own country.

In conclusion, both poin of the view can to be life. Some people belive that should aim to import as little as possible but another think that to import it important part in their buys and eats.

In this essay two ones will be discussed: identifying happiness (what is it?) and factors which are important in reading this very essence of the sense of life.
First of all, I will confirm that all the difficulties in identifying happiness exist due to a misunderstanding of the term. Nearly all of us think that happiness should be like something material or something that descends to you from somewhere else, while, in my mind, happiness is a regime of our own minds. Ifa human mind and a human body are systems they should work like our feds and machines. this way, happiness is a right regime for our mind and body which should not be strongly distinguished. In achieving this state of mind we should be mind-disciplined: be positive and open-minded. Setting up goals and achieving themis a very important factor to reach happiness. We should realise and materialise our creative individual nature and go on to a creative success. Look at the scientists: they are always in a process of creation new concepts on the base of new data and they are happy.
To conclude, I should repeat that happiness is not a gift but a result of our self-discipline. This discipline should include creative practicts as eassential part of a human nature.

So many people claim that air travel, which makes a significant countribution to air pollution and global warming, should be restricted by governmental laws. Personally, I can only partly agree with this opinion. To begin with, air travel is the fastest way of commuting. That doesn’t mean only personal convenience: an ability to change places quickly makes economic perfomances of firms more effective, reduces transactional costs, presenting benefits to the whole economic system. Moreover, decrease in use of planes will result in growth of the number of people traveling by cars and by trains which also contribute to air pollution. Nevertheless, some people may argue that the impact of air travel on environment is too massive to come up with it easily. Only governmental laws can alfer the situation as the industry itself won’t clearly take any actions and people in general are not ready to sacrifise the benefits air travel brings. Personally, I cannot fully agree with this argument as governmental intrusion in this industry can cause major economical problems that would be difficult to handle. Furthermore, I think that modern pace of life is simply impossible to maintain without having  fast way of commuting. Today only air travel meets this requirment. All in all, I believe that despite having some drawbacks, a lot of air travel is absolutely necessary in the modern world. The advantages of this mean of transport outweigh its disadvantages.

This essay will be about a negative influence of modern technology on human health. 

In my point of view, new innovations can be very harmful for human. To begin with, sitting for a long time in your telephone or computer can be very dangerous for eyes. Scientists believe that spend long time watching TV, playing computer games or chatting online in telephone can be harmful for human vision. Moreover, some innovations and new technologies have a high level of radiation. 

There is another point of view. Technologies are really safe from people and has only benefits. There are a lot of biomedical technologies in modern world that can safe people from different diseases. 

Development of new technologies is very important because they give people a lot of opportunities, for instance, people can speak with each other even they are in different countries, with the help of innovations it is possible to cure a lot of diseases. 

In conclusion, I would like to point out that sometimes new technologies is very harmful for people, but they have more advantages than disadvantages.

I think, that the second point of view is more appropriate, as it garatees other sportsmen that there will be no cheating. Anyway, in this essay will discuss both points of view.
Some people clam that sport nowadays becomes very popular and almost everyone has its favourite type of competing. For instance, there are lots of fans of football or tennis. Those, who watches competition or match, takes it like a show. They used to the main ""characters"" and sportsmen become familiar. Usually, people trust them, but in many cases they are not even interested whether their favourite athlete use drugs or not. It is a crucial issue, because people really do not focus on it and are not going to overcome it. Such people claim that athletes should not be banned at all or should be banned for a limited period. I am strongly disagree with these point of view, because there is no garantee in this situation that athletes will not be cheating in future.
There are those, who understand the importance of this problem. People claim that sportmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. In this case using illegal drugs will not be flourish and sport will be safe. Sportmen and other people will be sure that it is a fair game. I consider that this is the main feature of sport and fair game should not underestimated. Obviously, athletes who use llegal drugs should be banned forever.
To conclude, there are different points of view, but people should understand that cheating in sport must be banned.

For instance, 80% of people who are under 26 years old make their study to find a good job. For people, who are over 49 years old much more important is their interest in subjects. The percent of people who study for interest rise steadily with their age.
For people who got study for career we can see different tendency - the number of those people slides if they become older.
It can be seen that the percent of people who are supported by employers declines for people from 26 years old to 30-39 years old. Than it jumpes for people over 49 years old, from 30% to 40%.

Firstly, I want to write about some important procs of this international problem. There are some advantages of it.  One of pluses is that this manipulation with companies’ businesses can help developing countries improve their international level and later transform in developed countries because this companies, wich about we discussed, employ local workers and the level of unworking is decline. The second important advantage of this statement is that the level of concurental decreases because some big and rich companies move their business to poorer and because of it little and new firms with yung and poalstream workers can develop their business. What about disadvantages, there are some important cons of this problem. Firstly, old companies, wich  have exosted in the market for a long time, can create monopoly on the goods or services what they products for a majority of people this is not very useful because people would like that in the market will be many goods and services and they can chose one of them withe a brilliant of perfect quality, the second minus is that the economy of the country where company moved busines to poorer and developing country, can decline because one of the important parts of the economy and international policy moved to poorer. This situation is very awful for level in the world of this country. Over all I tend that this situation with international companies, wich move their business to poorer, developing countries, have more advantages then disadvantages.

On the one hand, in the world of internet some people use social media for finding information or giving necessary one because is easily to contact everybody through Facebook or Vkontakte. Developers of these networks invented such great application that allow us to receive messages in seconds and send them. Moreover, most companies, even universities have their own page in every network because of its accessability for target audience. On the other hand people often us Internet only just for entertainment. In Vkontakte most messages are sent just for fun or the information received is not valuable. Also such services are used by some companies just for advertising and creating a buzz. In conclusion, it should be mentioned that everybody needs to decide what his/her purpose of using any social media is and how to use it effectively according to that need. I personaly agree with the statement which indicates that the main purpose social networks is simply to entertain rather than to after valuable information.

Firstly I noticed the graph of Japan population. We can see an extremely rising up graph, after the 2030th. Before that, really low positions of Japan could be caused by the Nuclear explosions in Hirosima and Nagosaki, and after-explosion results: as mutations and cancer.

Others suppose it would not be effecient. Let us discuss both these views.
If we are saying that sport facilities will bring a good effect our reason can be the fact that people like to be used to something no matter what. My experience shows that people choose the most comfortable things. if a basketball stadium was closer to my home than a supermarket I would be addicted to sport rather than chocolate and it would be more healthy for me obviously.
On the other hand others could say that it is difficult to make people do anything unless they want it. So maybe there are other measures that goverment can do. For example, the healthy way of living can be promoted by social advertising so people will find the ways of improving their health by themselves. Furthermore, the money can be spent on medicine, new searchs and payment for doctors. Personally, for me it would be meaningful if there were the special prices for products which harm my health.
To sum up, both points of view can be. However, I think it would be better to take ideas from both of them because there are good reasons. As for me, the question of health is personal to every person.

Generally speaking, the majority of health problems concerned to modern technology can develop due to overusing that one. It is clear that technologies exist for a quite long term and could not be as damaging as first ones. For example, monitors of computers became more healthy and have a less impact on eyes then they had in the end of the 20th century. Nevertheless, technicues are developed, sciencitist research and work with all problems they face, so it is not smart to deny results of their actions. 
However, people still have health problems using modern technologies and they need to trackle or avoid it. The successful example of avoiding the problems of sleeping is using phones, laptops or computers the last time before going to bed in two hours at least. Consequencently, people who had insomnia before this new behavior noticed that later their sleeping became stead and calm.

As a matter of fact, several experts impose that sportsmen caught using forbidden drugs should not be allowed to take part into competitions for a broaded period, while the opponents feels more radically and claim that the sportsmen ought to be banned forever. Then, two positions will be considered and the third point will be made.
First of all, it is vital to realise that 'doping' includes not only steroids but also some medical drugs that several sport organisation write in the documents like 'adomdomned drugs'. For instance, great amount of Russian athletes suffered from WADA’s zotoctions, because WADA decided to include meldonium into illegal medicaments. And the champions are not only lost their awards and statues but also forbidden compete professionally at all. Unfortunatly, for most athelets, who sometimes are the only bread winners in their family, it is a serious punch. Hence, the banning for a short period will be sensible decision.
Another point of view also has right to exist. Sometimes, the athelete deserves to be banned for the rest of his/her life. To be more precise, several categories of athletes have tendency to cheat for every competition. Hence the only right way to tackle that problem is to exclude the sportsmen from associaton and team. On the other way, the competition risks to become the race of 'the one sportsmen'.
Personally I think, on the one hand, the excluding sportsmen from the competetive team forever is to draconian punishment, as new changes can get into strengh rapidly and atheletes and their teams noy a problem with doping test just because a medical drug which used to be obvious for all atheletes became illegal though on several months. On the other hand, the results of the competitions should not be addictive by drugs. That is why some dishonest sportsmen caught exploiting doping, probably will be caught twice or even more. In most case the sever sanction is permitted.

As I believe, the first people who must solve this problem are parents of those teenagers who decided to become a criminal person. The most important thing that allows avoiding this problem is to raise children in an atmosphere of love and happiness and to show them that a person must be honest and they will become such people for sure. Basically, parents and other folks should spend with their children as much time as it's possible to show them that they are extremely important for their family. By my experience, I know a girl who is my neighborhood and she always seemed to me to be such a quit and polite girl until she started smoking, chilling with some strange guys and become pregnant in the age of 14. Fortunately, she doesn’t commit any crime and I know, it sounds like stupid series but I'm so disappointed with this fact that her life’s been ruined and, in my opinion, it's happened because she's been grown up in a poor family without a farther and with an abusive mother. Otherwise, if parents abuse their kid or don't care of them, it will surely provoke cruelty's emergence.
Secondly, teachers should pay a lot of attention to this problem as well, because they are believed to be the second family for children. So, if a teacher sees that a pupil starts behaving in abnormal way or he starts communicating with suspending people, they should warn parents for sure. In case if they see that a child feels lonely in their family, a teacher should try to become friends with them, to get to know what's happened and to try to provide some help. Furthermore, I believe that well-educated people are rarely about to commit any crime, so, we should pay much more attention on what's going on at schools. A little bit of interest won't harm a child, in contrast, it will help him to understand that the world isn't indifferent to him and there exist people who do care.
To sum up, I would like to say, that the problem isn't easy to overcome and, unfortunately, there will be a lot of cruel teenagers who won't miss a chance to commit a crime until we curb existence of indifference in families and at schools. That is how I see it.",65,2,1

In this essay, I will outline some of the causes and possible solutions to the problem.
The two primary causes of the issue are video games and movies.

Nowadays video games often feature scenes of rampant violence, gore, blood and other disturbing elements. In the 90s, a video game called Doom was released on the market, which soon became very popular. The game featured first-person view shooting and killing with lots of blood. Soon after, a young man committed rampage at school, claiming that he wanted to replicate the game in real life. This serves as an important example to the fact that games may cause young people to follow a crime path.

Moreover, movies and especially Sci-Fi films are becoming even more realistic than before. There is an abundance of action films, thrillers, horrors that all feature killing people, mutilation, going over the limits. What is disturbing that this is often shown as if it were easy to accomplish, naturally offering children and adolescents an example.

In other words, the causes lie in the incessant flow of violence from games and movies which trigger the desire to try this in real life. Some of the possible solutions to this problem include restricting video games and movies and promoting lawful behaviour.

Video games and movies could be restricted by age groups, so that games and movies that are only permitted to adults would only be allowed with parental supervision. For example, a game rated 18+ would only be allowed to adults or children with adult supervision, provided that adult consider the game appropriate.

It is also paramount that there be increased teaching and promotion of lawful behaviour. Schools should teach their students to obey the law and to think their actions thoroughly. Penal code should be taught at schools, so that young people know what could follow if they decide to act against the law.

To conclude, the two causes that raise the issue of increased crime rate are violent video games and movies, which may be solved by imposing age limits on games, movies and promoting lawful behaviour.",70,2,0

This fact is also suitable for the modern audio and video spheres. New types of music and films are appearing even while I’m writing this essay. As a result there are lots of materials to be bought, but people don’t want to spend money for it. They prefer just to download illegal pirat copies and watch or listen everything at home. Let’s think about should they be punished or not.
Be honest, I’m a person, who never buys official materials in shops. That’s why I totally disagree with the point about punishments. First of all, people, who download music or films from the net don’t want to pay a lot of money for it in brand shops. That happens becouse of products’ price. It’s extremly huge and can really hurt your budget.
To prove my point of view I ask you to imagine the following situation. You came to the media shop and you eyes couldn’t see all of films presented there. So, what would you choose. How would youd decide what to buy? Would you take a film, which cost 800 roubles or even more? Well, let’s imagine, that you bought one. Then you came home and couldn’t wait to see a perfect film! But… You turned it on and in the first the minutes you understand thit it was awful. What were your emotions? Talking about myself, I would feel sorry about wasting my time and my money. To prevent such situations I prefer to watch films online and then, if I liked it, I would go to the shop and buy it.
And what about people, who doesn’t have an opportunito to listen to music or watch film at all? He doesn’t have any money for it. Does it mean that they should forget about media sphere. A guess no. And pirat copies is the solution.
To conclude everything I want to say that copying and sharing music or films through the internet isn’t a theft. This just a way to be common and to have the same opportunities as other people have. That’s why I think that downloading illegal copies shouldn’t been punished.

For example, in Germany print books' level remains stable, while the eBooks' is rising. This data can allow us to notice a common production increase. At the same time common production sellings in China will face a decline. The fall of sellings will probably be equals to 0,1 Billion US Dollars. Same thing can be noticed in the UK.
To sum up, we emphasize one more time positive tendentions in the USA and Germany and underline a merely not significant decline in China and UK sellings, based on analytics information of this bar chart.

Needless to say that new gadgets are being created in order to make our live easier and more convenient. Anyway, some time after realization and using of them, scientists find out that some gadgets may be hazardous to heath. For example, almost everybody has a microwave ""oven"" in the kitchen. This gadget is extremely useful because helps us to make food hot in a few minutes without odd actions and preparings, but microwaves themselfs may affect badly our hormonal system. The way how to minimize this risk was found. Now manufacturers set special ""defenders"" around dangerous zones. So, the system is still based on microwaves, but they are unable to cause health problems.
Another example concerns monitors and TV screens. We remember that some time earlier they were big, low-quality and simmering because worked though special beams' emitter. These monitors were hazardous to humans' sight because of permanent simmering. Nowadays we have monitors with liquid crystals, which do not deteriorate the functions of our high organized sight system.

The unstoppable technical progress has opened some new ways to stop the development of cancer, such as some nuclear therapy and there were even some groups of patients who got a remission after it.

As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.”
It is a well known fact that today there are a lot of ways to travel such as car, train, underground, booths and of course airplane, which is the most popular. Some people belive that air travel make much air pollution and is the reason of global warming, so they argue that we need reduce the amount of air travel to avoid natures problems. Other people say that we need to try to find scintific way to decline air pollution from plan, without changing amount of air travel. I fully agree with the second group.
First of all, I supose that people mast have an apportunity to travel because it help us to travel. I mean that, it is a chance for tourist visit all over the world, learn new cultures, broaden their horisens. For example, Airplane is the best way foe man, who live in Sibiria, where weather is cold full time, visit sunshine beach.
The second reason, why I strongly belive that we really need in Air travel is access to other countries experience in medicine of business. According to the statistic a lot of people with some horible diseases can get cvalificate help only in japan. For example, so they must travel only by airplane because it is the faster way to japan from UK, for example.

However, creative artists cannot always express their ideas in any way they like because of the government regulations. The question is whether there should be government restrictions on what creative artists do.
Personally, I believe that government restrictions are essential. Too much freedom can lead to the anarchy. Take graffiti for example, a lot of artists create real pieces of art which fit the urban life and even make it more beautiful. However, some works can spoil the appearance of the city, as they  can contain some offensive and rude meaning. Moreover, it is important to say that modern art is provocative and it can lead to serious problems. For example, some rap musicians sing about using drugs and alcohol. Young people may get under the influence of the wish to try these harmful things. Furthermore, some works of art can cause psychological problems among different people. For instance, new films, especially thrillers and horrors, can create in person's mind fear, hatred or depression.
Nevertheless, I have to notice that censorship by the government may be too strict. It can bother the development of the art. Many years ago graffiti was seen as a prohibited form of art so it was illegal to do it. However, people started to understand that it is a real art and government could not prohibit it any more.
To sum up, I think that there should be government restrictions on the freedom to express your own ideas among creative artists, but these regulations should not be too strict. Otherwise, the modern art will stop developing. Without freedom its development is impossible.

There are some major trends observed in the information given. First of all, it is obvious that Facebook reaches the highest score within every age group among all three social networks. Moreover, the percentage use of Facebook in the least age group, 65+ years old, is higher than any of the scored reached by the highest age groups in Instagram or LinkedIn, making Facebook even more popular with the crowd. 
Besides, it is noticeable that the age group of 65+ years has the smallest percentage use of all the three social networks, suggesting the fact that elderly people are least interested in any of them.
Finally, LinkedIn turns out to be the only social network in which the percentage use of the 30-49 age group is higher than this of the 18-29 age group, which might be a proof for the fact that middle-aged people are more interested in a professional social network than in an entertaining one, whilst younger people seem to have less passion in it. 
Overall, the statistics completely match with the expected results of the research.

As is seen in the given illustration, the data in the line graphs is presented for 1 year.

From the first line graph it can be seen that the biggest indicator of temperature is about 25° in the Jule. The minimum is equal to about 12°. While the smallest indicator of temperature in Rio de Janeiro is equal to 13° in this month. It must be noted that the maximum is equal to about 25°. The analysis shows that the smallest indicator of temperature in Yakutsk is equal to -40° in the janyar. It is important to note that the maximum is equal to -35°. While the higgest indicator of temperature in Rio is equal to 30° in this month. As is presented in the illustration the minimum is equal to about 23°.

The percentage of manufactured goods and chemicals in overall transportation is practically identical in both cases (25 and 28; 11 and 16 accordingly). However, many differences exist also. Metals are transported by rail three times more than by road. The difference in transporting machinery is even more significant: the percentage of machinery transported by road is six times less than the same metric in the case of transportation by rail. On the contrary, producers of non-metallic minerals and food products tend to use roads when they want to transport their goods.
To sum up, producers of food products and non-metallic minerals pefer to choose transportation by road, while producers of metals and machinery are more likely to use rail to transport their goods. Finally, producers of chemicals and manufactured goods didn't show any significant preferences in means of transportation.

I fully disagree with this view and strongly believe that such suggestion is absolutely unefficient.
First of all, it is obvious that men are more inclined to specific professions, and receive better results working in some fields. For instance, in engineering or physics specializations more men succeded, probably because of a different way of thinking. If universities start to accept the same number of male and female students, the progress in science is very likely to decrease. Subsequently, it will lead to the loss of efficiency and less developments. Moreover, if there are some vacant places on a certain faculty and all women are already accepted, the rest of the men applied for this programme will not have a chance to get education.
In contrast, some people contend that this suggestion should be accepted in order to obtain national equality and eliminate the descrepancy between both genders. Notwithstanding this idea, I think that this solution to the problem of unequality is not right. Students should be choisen by their skills and abilities that they demonstrated on the exams, otherwise it seems likely that talented or smart people in one field risk to study the subject they are not keen on.
Overall, to my mind, suggested idea mainly aimed to solve the problem of inequality, will only exacerbate the situation,, leading to a more serious descrepancy between men and women.

This essay will argue the causes of diseases and analyze problems and solutions of the widespread use of computers and their harmful influence.
There are tough challenges associated with this issue and its effects have very serious consequences. Public generally tend to believe that computers and sitting lifestyle cause a healthy problems, such as: a decreasing quality of seeing, diseases of eyes. However modern medicine is developing too and there is no problem to improve your eyes nor doing eyes-exercises either doing making medical operation. One cannot be deny that the quicker IT-sector improves, the b tter medicine becomes to be. Progress is coming in all spheares.
One more problem than can be mentioned is heart-attacks and obesity. Nowadays there is a trend, for instance, to work in front of the monitors, ocasionally people have a freelance job, they prefer to work at home. One of the most striking problem it is deficite of actions. It leads to obesity, bad mood, non-active and not enthusiastic lifestyle. This problem can not be solved in the whole because of developing demand in the labour market of IT, advertising, PR and different non-active but extremely important jobs. Moreover, There is no way to overcome Internet-addiction absolutely, but scientists suggest that new generation will not be the same addicted as modern generation because there is a new knowledge and understanding that sitting in front of the monitors is a waste of time.
From these facts one may conclude that despite of the fact that modern technology is causing an increasing number of heath problems, there are new ways to improve the medicine and to provide a new form of saving our lives. To sum it up, mankind should understand - there is no progress without mistakes and troubles.

People prefer to download films or music compositions and do not want to bye original versions of files.

On the one hand, I can understand people, who downloads files. It happens because of pries are rising so fast and people have not so much money for it. That’s why in the beginning we find files in the Internet and only if we can not find something what we need, we will buy it. In various countries industries have got different opportunities to control illegal process of making pirate copies. For example, in Russia approximately all media files you can find in web. However, in Europe, as I know, it is hardly to do copies and, of course, to download them.

On the other hand, it is really bad when musicians and film makers lose their money. This is their work and it is understandable that they want collect money for their job. It is really difficult to work in this spheare. This job takes a lot of time, energy, emotions. Let’s think about this problem. For instance, one film producer spend a lot of money and power for making film, however, people download it and do not go to the cinemas, do not pay for original discs. That’s why producers haven’t more opportunities for making his films and due to pirates copies he lose his job. I suppose that solution of this problem is decreasing prices.

There are many advantages of this proces. But the number of disadvanteges is the same. Many people think that one of them is an increasing number of illness. I agree with them.

First of all, people send a lot of time in front of television, computer and other modern technics.  This lifestyle follow to different awful problems with body and eyes, even blindness. Despite this fact people continue to spend their time in such way, they watch TV or play in computer like crazy. So people become lazier and then fat. Extra weight – another important problem in our life. Fat people die earlier than thin.

Another big problem is pollution. The number of caus increase every day. Atmosphere become more and more pollute. This fact of course influence on our health.

There are many ways to solve this problems. Firstly, people shouldn’t spend so much time with modern gadgets. It’s become a part of our life, but it’s don’t mean that people should use gadgets all the time like zombi. Also people must relay some rules when using modern technics. For example, don’t seat too close to computers or TV. Secondly, people should built special buildings wich will help to clean atmosphere.

Many historical events such as wars make governments think more about their economy and overall supplies. One factor of this equation is food. Some people believe that their country only needs to produce the food that their own population eats and shouldn’t import as much, or at least aim to import as little as possible. There are many opinions on this controversial topic.

From one perspective, some people may claim food production an expensive means of  supply, requiring costs in both time and money, however making local production to be a first priority goal because doing so strengthens the economy by providing working places with an additional patriotic bonus. Furthermore, creating own food provides a sustainable resource while being independent from third parties or other countries. 

On the other hand, experts claim that political influence is neglible compared to immense benefits food importing provides. First of all, your working class becomes free (at least partially) from one duty being constant and reliable food supply, thus creating opportunities for more expensive industries. Moreover, political relationships are more positive than negative with the result being mutually benefitial deals between countries that can excessively produce food, and those who cannot.

All in all, this is a controversial question to be answered differently by every country. In my opinion, importing should be generally preferred because among all, it also benefits customers, and sometimes, the positive effects of economic trade deals become visible by the general population, reflecting in its well-being.

Secondly, copying and sharing music or films is theft, so, people who did it will be able to have got some problems with policemen. And, as a result, prisons waits them.
However, another group of people does not agree with the first. They suppose that it is not theft, it is only a chance to make watching and listening more convenience. They do not go to supermarkets or music shops to buy there video – or CD-disks. In addition to this, if they want to watch old film, there is an opportunity that they can not find it in shops.
As for me, I would disagree with this statement. First of all, now we live in the century of technology, so, why do we need to buy these products? And, obviously, this “theft” helps musicians and film producers. I can explain how. Music and films on the internet are free, so, more people can listen and watch these, so, they advise it for friends and family, and, as a result, someone can buy film – or CD – disks and this piece of music or film become more popular.

Government should solve that problem in another way, for example, give motivation for doing sports. Children and adults coming home and turn on their TV, but they do not want to go to the sport centre and start training. They do not understand that keeping feet is very good example for spending their leisure time.

There is an opiniot that goverment should introduce several lows in order to decline the number of flights. I somewhat disagree with this statement.
I agree with the position that amount of air travels should become less, because harmful things that sent into the atmosphere during burning the fuel are cause some issues such as global warming, air polution. On the one hand banning some air trips help to decrease harmful consequances for nature, but it can not solve the problem. There are a lot of transport, that burn the same fuel.
Fmom my point of view goverment should introduce laws that support science which create  ecological fuel, for example, machines that worked on water. The air trips the fastest way of trawelling, therefor it is the most convenient in modern life. If the government introduce laws that reduce the amount of car travels, it will be more useful, because there are a lot of cars and partiqurary everyone have a car. Some people believe that many cities today become a one big trafic jam. Reducing the number of cars can help to decrease burning a lot of fuel and then to decline the harmful consequences. Today many people in big cities prefer using a bycycle.

Some people believe that there are should be equal amount of males and females in every classes, while others maintain that gender does not relate to study. From my point of view, it is very important to accept equal numbers of both genders.

To begin with, I strongly believe that we live in a modern world, where we should avoid any stereotypes, which are connected with human’s sex. There are not any subjects, which are suitable only for men or women. Everybody should have a chance to do whatever they want. Futhemore, studying in a community with different genders can help you to improve ypur communication skills, which is really important, because sometimes people have problems with socializing with opposite sex. What is more, during studying at university students often meet their future wifes or husbands. Thus, mixed community can help students to build a successful family.

On the other hand, some subjects traditioanally are more difficult for exact sex, for instance females are usually worse in maths and physics than males. Moreover, such kind of mixed community can distract students from their study, while getting knowledge is the most important part of student’s life.

To sum up, I would like to point out that hummanity should try to get rid of old stereotypes and to take a new lifestyle, where there are not any differences between male and female students and where everybody can live in a unite and friendly community together.

Some people think that using the Internet for such purposes is a crime, while others support anouther point of view. 
To begin with, music and films are financed with a lot of money and using them without buying would lead to financial problems for musicians and film producers. If producers do not get profit from making a movie, they will not have money for new projects. Moreover, film industry consists not only of producers and actors. Also, there are the owners of cinemas who will not be able to continue their business if everyone will use the Internet for downloading films.
Nevertheless, some critics believe that people should have free access to music and films. Firstly, there is an opinion, that art should be free for every person because it gives people an opportunity to learn more about the world. For example, some films could be used in schools for making edicational process more interesting for children. Secondly, there are people who do not have enough money for buying music discs or films. For instance, children or disabled people usually do not have enough money to buy new films and music.

Currently the highest number of crimes relates to the age group of young people while in the past this trend wasn't so catastrophical. In this essay I will discuss possible reasons why it happens and provide potential solutions to crack down on the existing problem.
One possible reason of its happening can be explained by the development of cutting-edge technology. A bunch of sources became accessible than they had been before. As a result young people have infinite variaty of information from entertaiments to cruel videos. For instance, they watch films where there are killings, rapings, maggings and other types of crime. It leads to the development of the feeling that a crime is such a common thing that is normal to commit because in the screen it is committed so often. They observe that some of people who committed a crime are not caught, sent to the prison and punished. They want to be similar to their favourite protagonists from the screen, to those ""bad boys"". One of the possible solutions can be done by making a prohibition for young people to visit sites where there are such films. But first of all people should create separated sites where there are these movies.
The second reason can be explained the the lack of bringing up amoung young people. The fact is that some parents work around the clock and they practically do not have enough time to talk to their children, to explain them to what possible consequences their crime actions can lead and how it is actually scared. As a result children raise by their own communicating and spending time somewhere in the street with children whose situation in the family is similar to theirs. One of probable solutions to this problem can be done by changing working hours among adults who have children under the age. They should be given flexible working hours with the possibility sometimes to work from home in order they do not spend time in transport but spend this time with their family.
In conclusion, this is actually one of the most terrible problem in our society that escalates day by day. All the measures to solve it should be done immidiately otherwise it will lead to disastrous consequences.",70,2,0

To begin with, the introduction of mobile phones, computers and other electronic devices brings generation to electronic addition. That is to say, people use this devices everywhere - in order to work, teach at school, plan their free time. It results badly on their eyes and leads to the increase of eye diseases throught the world. Moreover, modern technology ease life of people, so they don't have to work hard or do extra movements. This situation causes the passive style of life as the amount of movements that have to be done by people reduced greatly. It leads to overweighting and heart attacks.
However, there are some ways to minimaze the negative effect. First, it is better to control the number of time, spending in front of the devices, so that the eyes can get relaxed and renew. What is more, people should pay more attention to sport activities and be more active in every-day life. For example, they can go to the gym, walk in a park or cut down the amount of junk food.
To conclude, although modern technology provides lots of benefits, it also leads to health problems. So that in order to reduce the negative influence on health people should pay more attention to their well-being.

This ideas can take children more nervous and angree. For example, in 1990 in Russia was no cencure and at this time the level of crime rose, about 60 per cent of hole sosiate think that the crime is normaly. In 2000 the freedom of artists’ ideas was baned, when the level of crime was less than in 2000.

People who write music, make films must do the big job, this people find information and analist for people and peoples.

It is also considerable that if a government would spend more money to support local film industries then films produced would be more prefered.
Today, English-language culture became a world pop-cilture, so American and British films are also watched by people to improve their English. But if it was only about language, people would also watch Australian and South African films. There are some reasons for English and Americans films being more popular all over the world. For example, biggest film-producing corporations are situated in US, so it is obvious that in US are produced many more films espetially hero-movies, trillers, comedies and dramatical ones. All those films became a part of international pop-culture and if you watch, for example, superhero films you always have a topic to discuss with someone who has absolutely different local culture than you and who lives on the other side of our planet.
The quality of film does not correlate with money spent on it so much: there are a huge number of great and popular low-budget films. There is a popular opinion that locally produced films are more specific for the country where they were produced, for example, what is filmed in Balkan countries hardly would be understanded by West European people for language shifts and life style. And it is also conciderable that local films are more abstract and experimental, so the cultural background is really important.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the world popular culture has a very big influence on local films. Those folms which would be understood by people all over the world would be more popular.",70,2,1

Firstly, the number of male and female students does not matter for studing process. I don't have any thought about influence by it for study.
Secondly, accepting equal numbers of both is almost impossible. Usually there are more girls than boys entering in humanitariaty Universities and more boys than girls entering in technical.
Thirsty, the sex of student can't be significant point for decision to take him or her in University. The main categories are knowledges , skills and ability to study something new.
From the other hand, groups with equal numbers of male and female students may be more balanced. It can be usefull for socialisation of young people. Some problems, which don't conected with study, may be disappeared. An example from my own experience is 8 March, women's day. In our group there are 20 girls and only 5 boys. That's why our male students were not very happy in that day. However, despite that they were in minority they made a very good presents to girls.

The attitude to this issue is a serious bone of contention not only between politicians and critics but also between ordinary art-lovers. So let us have a closer look on this problem. 
According to the opinion which can be at some point called conservative, art exists to arouse the sense of beauty and harmony in human's heart, to amuse and please and by this improve them. So, to this point of view, art should not dwell upon the themes that are considered inappropriate. Though other people consider freedom of self-expression the inalienable quality of any art. So it meets the question of freedom to express one's opinion. Not only says artists what he aims to say but iften dwells upon some serious political or social problems in his works. That is what makes the problem so urgent. Still there are pieces of art that can easily hurt someone's feelings or are simply disgusting. But in this case another, complicated question arises - is this really art?
For me the freedom of art is essential for the democratic society. Although some pieces of it can be shoking or even somitimes repulsive to some extent, I believe that they have a sensible message to the audience and meet the common moral criteria they have all rights to exist.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I partly agree with the idea at social media being entertainment but I also believe that social media have the goal to share information and knowledge but in my opinion the purpose of entertainment is more important than sharing information.

There is a number of possible approaches that the government able to introduce. One of them is to increase the number of sport facilities. However, some people state that if this measure is simplied it would have little impact on public health. Advocates of increasing the number of facilities consider this measure to be efficient enough. Increased number of, for example, gyms will contribute to the easier accessability to such sport facilities. For instance, people who want to be fit will not waste their spare time on the road to sport facilities. Therefore, providing the population with sport attractions the government will achieve the goal of healthier generation. However, some individuals suppose that the increased number of facilities is not the sufficient decision enough to be taken. They admit that there is a shortage of such facilities but the government has to utilize a propaganda of healthy  lifestyle. Using modern informational technologies the advantages of doing sport can be wide-spreaded amid the whole population. For example, a simple article in newspaper regarding to the advantages of sport can attract more people to stay healthy. In conclusion, I would agree with those who consider the increased number of facilities to be not effective. To my mind, this approach cannot create strong incentives for people who opt for sedentary lifestyle. Hence, the government should take some more effective actions to improve the situation with population’s health.

Some people consider that the distraction for 2 full years is enough. At first, the athlete would understand the weight of responsibility over his shoulder. The second main point of these people's view is that all of the illegal drugs will move out from person's body after two-years period.
However a lot of people are sured that the whole situation isn't so simple. Firstly, some drugs are so effective that they could change the whole blood structure, for example. And it is something that couldn't just go away after some years. Another important point is that the agreement of a sportsman for using drugs illegally. means that this person has no respect for the whole industry, and it's important to ban such people from competition for the rest of their lives
In my opinion, sportsmen caught using illegal drugs shouldn't take part in any other professional competition at all, because it's highly important to protect other athletes from their possible cheating. Because if a person went against the rules one time, he could do it again.
To sum up, nowadays athletes caught using illegal drugs are banned from professional competitions for only 2 years, but it is possible that the ruler will changes and such people wouldn't take part in them at all.

However, it is not possible to define it in one strict way? Practically, most people believe that no. But, at the same time, they are convinced that happiness is extremely important and actual in our life. By the way, do we have any factors, according to which, we can judge wheter the person is happy or not? In my opinion, I strongly reckon, that happiness in our life is above all, moreover, the definition of it is different for each person beacuse of own priorities and factors. For several reasons which I will mention below I explain why do I think so.
First of all, all people are individual. It is rude and incorrect to give an exact meaning of happiness for all humankind. Moreover, we have to remember that our world is controversial. For example, there is a popular opinion that people can rule the world. To my mind, I totally disagree: world is able to rule us. It dictates us social roles, it can help us to an outstanding carreer and at the same time, it can punish is just for a little mistake and put down us right to the bottom of the society. As a result of this, most people understand the word ‘happiness’ in a different way. For someone just to wake up will be the greatest achievement. For another person to be happy is all about money, I mean just to be a millionaire or something like that.
In addition, I would like to prove my point of view with the fact from my everyday life as well. For instance, about 1 year ago I lost my grandmother as a result of her death. She was only 64 years old. Too young, to ambitious, too kind, generous person. An outstanding mother, sister and grand mother. The desease which gives no chance to stay alive. She had been trying to overcome it, try to be needed for people who are around her. Despite the desease she was absolutely happy. To be happy for her meant to be with her relatives, to help them, just to be with them as many hours as she can. Death. Happiness does not matter for it. Fair or not? For me, my grandmother was the true example of a real happiness. To sum all up, I would like to state that happiness is controversial and quite different for everyone. It is impossible to give a definition for it. But it is possible to provide this feeling if not for ourselves but for people who are around us. This is the main point. Our life is too short not to be happy.

While some of them say that the main aim of such media should be sharing information and knowledge, other argues, that they should just be a source of fun. In this essay I will describe both of views and give my own opinion. Without doubts, such media as Facebook and Vkontakte are great source to provide information as they have million of people as audience.  Some groups in Vkontakte have more than 5 million subscribes, for example, that is even more, than the audience of some Russian Federal TV channels. That ids why some people support the idea of using this media as mainly to share knowledge and information. However, many of such groups just entertain people with music and funny pictures and that is why become so popular. What is more , many people use social network only to chat or listen to music. If the main purpose of social media is showing information, they will become use less for such people. The second point of view is that social networks should be used mainly for entertainment. There are a lot of other ways to get information: TV, books, printed media and special websites, like Wikipedia so there are enough way to have information. Furthermore, such social, as Vkontakte or Facebook were established to let people communicate with each other and have fun and many believe that nothing should be changed. But that people don’t count the fact, that a lot have change a rule media were created. Such social networks didn’t have many users and tourget audience were young people. Today millions of people of all age spend their time in Vkontakte and Facebook and many newspapers and magazines have their online version in social networks. People today use their media not only to entertain, but also to share information and that process should be controlled. Personally I believe that both points of view are correct and social media both to entertain and to provide knowledge and information and they should not focus only on one aspect.

Some people decree that governments should reduce the amount of air travel by introducing some specific laws. In my opinion, air travel greatly involves on globalization and there are so many other more damaging processes with problems that really should be solved.
With a rise of machinery throught globalization, there is a rise of some types of transport which can help to connect many countries for some government and business needs. Also, such transports like air transport male people closer and the distance shorter.
Consequantly, trips are easier now, it let us to go wherenever we want and desire.
Where are a lot of another problems that take more damage that air travel. Firstly, factories produce a lot of gases polluting the environment. Ot course, government already takes taxes from such companies, but from my point of view, it is not enough. Secondly, other vehicles like cars, buses really pollute air. Althought, there are a lot other doing like deforestation. So, the government should pay attention on this sides, because without air transportation it is complicated to connect between develop and developing countries.
Probably, I think that government should not reduce the amount of air travel for business, because they gain much money from that by selling and buying sometimes air transport can fly almost empty, without passaegers. It can be because of unsuitable weather for travel. Many tourists prefer just summer to go abroad.
To sum up, I would like to say that air transport has much power to connect countries and it is self-crident tuar positive sides of this process is more important than drawbacks, because these negative sides have more important reasons to became.

I think life skills are very important and by doing voluntary work, students can learn how to communicate with others and work in a team, but also how to manage their time and improve their organizational skills. Nowadays, teenagers don’t have many after schools activities. After school clubs are no longer that popular and students mostly go home and sit in front of TV or play video games.
By giving them compulsory work activities with charitable or community activities, they will be encouraged to do something more creative. Students will also demanding more respect towards work and money as they realize that it is not only that easy to earn them and hopefully will learn to spend them in more practical way. Healthy life balance are strongly promoted and therefore any kind of spare time charity work will prevent from sitting and doing nothing.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that it is a very good idea, and I hope that this programm will be sucsessful.

However, it all needs money, so people found a way to economize via creating illegal pirale copies. Some people think that there is nothing wrong in downloading pirate files. Others are sure that using copies, instead of buying the original discs, inspire hackers to steal. That is why such actions are illegal as well, and people who download pirate copies should be punished.
From the one point of view, some measures should be taken to prevent pirate files from spreading. And the most profitable way to stop it is to influence potential clients, because there should be a demand for supply to exist. Consequanly, if nobody downloads stolen files, nobody will steal.
From the other point of view, people have the right to download everything which might be downloaded. There are a lot of special programmes which help to secure files on the Internet. So if musicians and film producers want their files not to be copied, they should protect them better.
I personally think that it is too difficult to speak about originality at the century of high technology and mass media. People use the Internet for their own aims and it is unfair to punish them for downloading something which is created for being downloaded.
To sum it up, even if the idea of punishing those, who use pirate copies, is reasonable enough, it is too hard to make it real. There are millions people in the world who are used to free pirate files. It would be too difficult to control them all.

Indeed, it is very popular now: there are a lot different organizations, social movements ect. Some people tend to think that universities can destroy problem of gender by accepting the same number of male and female. I absolutely disagree with this statement. The first point why I think so is an interest. It is a well-known fact that some girls can’t be good in Physics, and they are not interested in it. Also like some boys don’t like cooking. Now you will never find more than 2 or 3 female students in engeneering groups. Universities can do nothing to solve gender problem. The second point is this measure can have influence on our choice. For example, student want to be a doctor but there are enough male that’s why he goes to teacher’s faculty. It is limitation for our choice, I am convinced that it is not great. 
The third point is there is different proportion of population in the world. In different countries, in different cities there are not the same number of female and male. For example, in India proportion of male is higher than proportion of female. The same situation in universities and the measure which is suggested in the statement will never be a reality in different region.
I am unconvinced that equal number of boys and girls can led to good gender environment. I don’t tend to think that there is advantage in a result, the world will have equal number of doctors, economists, lawyers, but do we need all of them in the same number? We can see it on example of different region. I am not sure that some poor african countries need the same number of teachers and managers. Obviously, they need teachers, doctors.
In conclusion I would like to emphasize that universities will not solve gender problem by accepting the same number male or female because it should be a student’s choice and problem of government. Also universities will not solve problem of lack specialists in different areas because of problematic reality.

The main drawback of air travelling for society is the pollution caused by them. There is a widespread opinion that government should regulate air travels and reduce the pollution by decreasing the number of flights. I partly agree with the point of view because with air travel popularity many people forgot about other transport for moving outside like trains, ships and cars. In this way it is often possible to cause less pollution, travel with comfort on short distances and sometimes here a better connection with nature and different cultures by stopping in other towns and cities rather than spending several hours looking in illuminator. On the other hand, the main advantage of the plains is their mobility. Sometimes it seems impossible to substitute it with other types of transport when you need to move fast from one place to another to make an important business deal or visit your sick grandmother. Impossible to argue that moving to the opposite side of the earth without wasting more than 12 hours is a great achievement of scientists progress and it’s hart to return to slower ways of travelling. To sum up, air travel without doubts became a part of our society nowadays and it’s a problem to substitute it in most of the cases. But government may encourage people to use other types of transport when it’s possible to pollute air less. But problems of global warming and pollution are still very important so in my opinion we shold focus on finding the alternative ecological fuel rather than reducing amount of air travel.

Why did this happen? What are the ways to make lower the level of crime among teenagers?

First of all, we need to know why did the level of crime boost up. Personally I think, that currently there are lots of homeless children or children who's parents are not interested in their children's life. Furthermore, in the majority of suburbs, sush as so-called ""hood"", we can see people who are at the edge of poorness, they do not work at all. for them it is easier to go and rob the bank or some wealthy houses. This people do not go even to schools, I am not talking about colleges. Talking about one more reason, nowadays we have a high level of dealing drugs, in some places we can see kids selling, or what is worse, buying drugs. That can be a strong cause to.

Second of all, what the parents need to do is keep an eye open on their children. And I am not talking about spying, no, but every mother or father needs to know with whom their son or daughter is a friend, where do their friends live. Although, it would be great to ask our child some questions. For example, where are you meeting with your friends? Do you want me to drive ypu there? How was your day? What is new?

To conclude, parents need to maintain the connection between them and their children. The society, including the government, needs to help poor families, needs to provide teenagers in ghettos and hoods education and teach them some jurasical laws.

Most people think that government should pay more attention on social problems rather then on building new space ships, while I am not agree with them.
In my opinion, space exploration is not a waste of money. Firstly, scientists do a lot of research in the space. Thus, during such expeditions we can learn something new not only about different planets, but also about our own home. Secondly, it improves the way how we live. We would not have such common things today like television or the Internet without space exploration. In the near futur we might have something new that will be absolutely irreplaceble.
Nevertheless, some people are quick to point out that trying to be the best in such field governments forget about real problems in their countries, for example, the level of life, crime, homeless people and other social problems.
However, I believe that if the president, for example, decides that his country wants to be a part of space exploration teem, he understands how much it will cost and he will never spend money that are ment to be for social purposes. Otherwise, he can loose support of his people.

I am completely agree that people who download such files should be punished, but there are some advantages and disadvantages of this situation which I will discuss in this essay. 

For the one hand, pirate copies allow poor people who have no opportunity to buy original discs to download and to enjoy music or films. For some people it is the only chance to know cinema trends and popular musicians. They have no way in that situation and no possible solutions. 

For the other hand, it is a complete break of author’s rules. In this case such theft should be punished by tax. Futhermore, there is another problem of pirate copies. People who download copies are risking to catch a virus on their computer or tablet. It is definitely a big problem and a cause why pirate copies should be prohibited. One more disadvantage of sharing pirate copy is losing money by producers and creators of music or films. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of using pirate copies. Moreover, it is a theft, but it seems to me that it should be punished by tax instead of strong punishment. Also musicians and film producers can create mote copies of their discs, for example, and try to solve it with the lowest price. It can be one of the possible solution in that situation.

This essay agrees that the breakthrough in modern technology might influence on human beings. Firstly, the essay will discuss some possible health problems, followed by suggestion of some issues, which can help to reduce the harm influence. 

First of all, the development of different modes of transport has become a cause of the increased quantities of carbon dioxide emissions in the air. As a result, air pollution has become a reason of significant growth of ill citizens. For instance, the Guardian reported that the number of unhealthy people in Britain had gradually increased on 2016 in comparison with 2005, because of environmental problems. Moreover, the development of URV – technologies leads towards the increase of the number of people with cancer diseases. 

In order to reduce harmful influence of technologies the government should enforce the restrictions on some products development and control the contemporary projects. For instance, the further improvement if URV-technologies might become a cause of new types of illnesses, therefore the government should provide severe control on these projects. 

In conclusion, the advances in technology projects can provide the improvement of living conditions as well as lead towards threats for human beings.

They can claim that the reducing of a number of crimes can be achieved because of longer prison sentences. Others do not believe that it is the most effective way to reduce crime.
First of all, people can say that nobody desires to spend a half of their life in prison. This way of reducing crime works because we use it. Moreover, it works because we do not go from home with a gun or some other thing to protect ourselves: laws really stop crimes. A person do not go to steal something because he knows that it costs a couple of years in prison. He could work legally and buy the thing he stole instead sitting in prison for that action. A fear of being punished will stopped him. What is more, the longer prison sentence can improve this way of punishment. A murderer can spend the whole life in prison, so he will think twice before he is going to plan a killing of another person.
Nevertheless, others undreline that we still have crimes and people do not stop because of prison sentences. Thus, other people can suggest to return some old methods for punishments. For example, an execution for murderers because nobody has a right to steal someone's life, so it would be fair to steal murderer's life. However, we do not have only the murderers, we cannot execute for stealing. Somebody can suggest to cut the hand for that crime like in previous centuries. As for me, I do not agree that we need to add new methods of punishment. An execution is a medieval method, so I do not think that we need to make a step back in the development of our civilization. we must not treat violence with violence.
To conclude, all people are different, there cannot be an universal way to prevent all the crimes and understand everybody's motives for a crime. we do not need to become as cruel as murderers for their deeds, so the best way is to give longer prison sentences. It is possible that in the future technologies will help us in that dilemma with the judjement of other human beings.",65,2,1

This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of locating foreign business in poor countries. Placing business in developing countries has many positive sides for international companies. Firstly, it impose them cheap work force because local people, which are mostly have not any education, demand for less salary then the employees in Europe and other developed regions. For example, it is twice cheaper to employ Chinese worker that the workmen from German. Another benefit is that there are more possibilities to set up new business project in developing countries as there are no other huge companies. However, enterpreneurs and international companies may face difficulties in working business in a foreign country, for instance, there can be some extra taxex to pay and there might be problems with medical enchurance for local workers. Another disadvantage is that sometimes international companies do not worried about the country’s environment and  pollute the surroundings. To conclude, there are both pons and cons of moving business in developing countries. It seems to me that if international companies will overcome some problems, foreign business will be very useful for economical development of poor countries.

Some people say that it is nessecary part of our life others say that it demages our environment and we should try to decrease number of flights.
In my opinion air travel is important for modern society. There is a sertain reason for it. Firstly, every country has it’s cultural identity, it’s tradition. Travelling enables us to meet with it, to make our life brighter with the emotions from foreign countries.
Secondly, a lot of people have relatives in different part of world. Family is very important for everyone. Some ways take too much time and planes are the fastest source of transport. Using air travelling can help people to spend together more time, reducing time in the way.
Moreover, there rare a lot of business duties that can not be done in one country. Society should share experience with other men. Also world trade is a base of the all state’s economics. People should travel for the success of their duty.
To sum up, I would like to say that of course air pollution is a huge reason for the reducing amount of flights, but world business is impossible with out it and it makes a big impact on world economic. Also, family and travelling are need fast ways of transport.

It is very hard for young people to find their place in the modern world. And the thought that they can get money without work seems very appealing to them. So, instead of studying at the schools and universities, they start, for example, selling drugs.
This lack of motivation to live a decent life boils down to a not proper raising them as a children. And this is a mistake of their parents and children. Parents and teachers should explain why it is morally wrong to lead a life of crime. They should spend more time on bringing them up and teaching them the right values.
Adults should also help the young generation to build a career. There would be no incentives to commit crimes, if earning money by a decent work was as easy as earning money by doing illegal things. Of course, that cannot be reached, but we should strive to that. Parents and teachers should encourage young people in their endeavors and not to discourage them from reaching their dreams.

For example can be taken any city near the ocean. They produce a lot of dish and oceanic products. But people can’t eat only fish. So, the city sell the fish and other products and bought bread, meat. 

Secondly, some cities builded only as military objects. They has no facilitye to produce food, they can only import it. Finally, a lot of European countries has not enough space to produce as much food as they need, That’s why they specialized on machinery and refactoring. They sell machines and factories and buy food. 

Overall, I think nowadays every thing works fine and countries should continue trade between then.

Some people believe that the situation can be improved if the time spent in a prison would be longer. In my opinion there are different ways which seem to be more effective such as the social politics and medical therapy.
To begin with, I believe that the government may establish some laws connected with the alchogol. The wonderful example is Iceland which has such laws: in weekends the alchogol is not saled and the prise on it in pubs and restaurants is practically enormous for an average european. The consequences of such social politics is a very low persentage of crimes in this country. People work during the week and just have no opportunities to have drunk. The other pretty good tendency which is useful to cope from the Iceland is creating a big amount of stadiums and workouts all over the country. It also can reduce crimes because the energy would be spent on sport activities.
Moreover, I think that the special therapies can solve the problems connected with crimes. It would be effective if every person could visit a good psycologist for free or to go to the special recreation areas to calm. Also it is very important to have been annualy observed and to have a special cureness if it is requared. The people are to have care on their mind health too while in the modern world it is hardly ever seem to be urgent to ask for a help in these cases.
All things consideres, I suppose that there are more human-frendly ways to reduce the crime than to expand the sentence of a prisoner, because it is not a fear to become a prisoner decreases the amount of criminals but a clear and healthy mind.",55,2,1

The chart below shows the information about the population in Yemen and Italy.
As we can see, in the year of 2000 in Yemen there were more than a half of population, aged from 0 to 14. So, the population of young people was much more in Yemen, than in Italy. It was only 14.3% in Italy in 2000. But, the workable population (aged 15-59) was bigger in Italy, than in Yemen (61,6% contra 46,3%). And, finally, Yemen's population is more younger, than Italy's one. There were only 3,6% of people aged 60 years in Yemen, and 24,1% in Italy.
	It is predicted, that it is going to be a reduce of the population aged 0-14 both in Yemen and Italy (from 50,1% to 37% and from 14,3% to 15.5%). But, we can see a rapid growth in population aged 15-59 in Yemen, and the same increase in population aged 60 years in Italy. So, both countries will become ""older"".

There are some reasons for this, among them is lack of governmental financial support.

There is a proverb in Latin ""panem et circenses"" that says people need food and shows - that is still true nowadays. British and especially American films are far more spectacular than any other movies (there is only one probable exeption - Indian Bolywood). For people it is much more interesting to watch some action movie with guns, cars and explosions like Fast and Furious. Fortunately, today we can find more films with deep meaning and ones that can be very inspiring, but general tendency shows that simple action movies are the most popular. They are so exciting due to expensive special effects, consequently, it is difficult to do it without money.

Secondly, one can produce a good movie easier when there is a financial support from government. Genius directors and scenarists undoubtedly exist but they cannot do anything because of lack of money. Holywood is a stable financial system but, for instance, in Russia it is extremely hard to find a financial support for a non-standard movie even if you are famous like Renata Litvinova. Russian government give financial support but unfortunately this system doesn't work well yet. The key problem is the evaluation of quality of films to be supported. The government should probably give not more money, but to more valuable films instead of giving it to most famous directors with standard plots.

Taking everything into account, it could be said that the key problems are tastes of people preferring expensive simple movies with much action and the government that should support really valuable local films instead of popular meaningless movies.",75,2,2

It is noticable, that all regions have minimized the number of children, who could not go to a primary school. For example, there was a strong downward trend in Africa – from nearly a quarter in 2000 it became lower and reached a point of around two millions less than 20 in 2012 for girls, and approximately the same decrease was for boys – 20 and 14,5 millions. Moreover, a big fall was in South Asia – the number of uneducated girls in 2012 was roughly 5 times smaller than in 2000, which was 4,8 and 21,6 millions respectively.
As it is evident, the highest point of children without ability to get a primary education in both years was being hit in Africa – in sum there were 43,7 and 32,7 millions in 2000 and 2007 respectively. At the same time, the most stable figures had the ""Rest of the World"" region, which at the beginning of the era hit a low of nearly 10,5 millions of boys without education and roughly 3 millions more than ten of girls.

Otherwise, they will use to be in prison, and after prison will continue doing the crimes to return in prison. Nevertheless, some people think that nothing but prison can change the person. So they think as longer someone is punished as better it will be for him or she. On the one hand, I see what they mean, there is  no doubt, that prison has influence on people.

At first, the air transport is the one of the popular, safety and fast king of transport. Nowadays, humanity can not to find appropriate substitution for it. For instance, it is impossible to remove on anather materic without air, if between couple of places are ocean.

Some tend to believe that sportsmen should be banned from competing professionally for some limited time period. Others want such athletes to be banned permanently. There are surely some serous arguments to support each of the positions.
It's crucial to understand that some people come into sports only due to the love for the competition or the athletic practice itself. Banning them for some time may help them to realize what they can actually lose if they don't stop their illegal actions. Moreover there are usually coaches responsible for giving them a medicine, so banning athlete permanently may simply ruin his life for no reason, while the real guilty person walks free.
On the other hand it's silly to deny, that such drugs affect organism in the permanent manner. Some affections may be harmful and some may give drugtaking athletes some advance. So letting those people compete again may be dangerous for their lives causing some accidents during the competition or simply dishonest. There is also a meaning, that the main factor in taking drugs is actually cheating. The person, who cheated once, is not likely to be trusted again later.
To sum up, there is no certain way of dealing with such a controversial question, as both positions present rather convincing arguments, which have to be studied more closely. In my opinion, the choice, whether the athlete should compete again later or not is only up to him. The positive affection on their body may actually be present, but not in the way those sportsmen would become unbeatable, so it isn't actually cheating. We cannot take anyone's dream away just in order to punish him for misstepping once. That's not what our society is standing for.

The main argument of the second view is that the cruelty of this measure contributes to stop any drug actions in sport. However, other people claim that it will not help and drug market will developes any way and sportsmen will try to avoid the punishments. Personally I agree with the stronger punishment because it promotes a fall in drug's market and will finally disappear.
Moreover, people think that sportsmen must be banned for a limited period because all people make mistakes and they can change. Nevertheless, the second group says that it not professional. In my opinion, limited period is more humanly, and it is great, however, I am in favour that this problem must be soluted at once.
In addition, people for limited punishment think that only one mistake would be a reason to inability to develope of sport sphere because lots of talented sportsmen could not take part in competitions. Nevertheless, people for strong punishment think that sport sphere will develope more efficently and without any troubles. I strongly agree with it!
In conclusion, as much as the limited period as a punishment may sound in humanism tradition only the conjunction of strong measures could help to tackle this problem.

First of all, moving business to poorer countries allows companies to spend less money on the production, which could make the goods cheaper. Secondly, factories located in the developing countries offer people places to work. It is especially important for the countries where the numbers for unemployed people are high.  However, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, the quality of goods produced in the developing countries can be rather poor, because the workforce does not have appropriate qualification and education very often. Secondly, the companies may treat the employees badly, not paying them salaries ot forcing them to live in terrible conditions. This is the question of human rights which is often raised by various public communities. Moreover, the opportunities to improve the technology used on the factories in the developing countries are rather limited. Finally, there are higher costs for transporting goods from these countries to other places, because the developing countries are usually remote from the main company's market.

Firstly, it is correctly to say that all professionally athletes have such a great responsible for all of their actions, and all of these actions have a reactions.

Some people may argue that it is cause for the ban for the rest of life. however they don not think about all traumas, time or power, which are connected with this athlet.

Such companies as Hollywood, Worner Brothers or Pixar supply films which any locally produced films could hardly beat. It is supposed that spectators prefer American or British films because of the sufficient financial support given by their governments.
I strongly disagree with this poin of view and I suppose that only true craftsmanship in cinematography allowes companies given above to prosper wordwidely. First of all, it woths to mention that these companies started their work in 1930s when they consisted of approximately five or six workers but they were skilled and had a great passion in their work. Those were small initiatives which had given their results and only after their first successful films they had become to be sponsored. Secondly, I would like to say that cast and plot of these film produced by American and English companies moslty are unprecendent what makes them to be on the top of the cinema industry.
However, many people believe that many locally produced films deserve more feedback than they have indeed by the world audience. For instance, Italian cinema has not so many fans as it could because of small scales it is released in comparison to the American or British ones. Moreover, these locally produced films are considered to be masterpieces due to their ideas. Many produsers have a real talent for film creation but it may be hidden because people are mostly interested in popular thrillers or in movies with impressive special effects.
Against to the arguments given above I can give the examples of the films which were locally prodused but have recieved the worldwide appreciation. Among them are such films as 'Stealing beauty', 'Miracles in Milan', 'Life is beautiful' by Italian produsers. These film have captured the audience thanks to their deep thoughts and sence without any great financial expenditures.
Taking into consideration all I mentioned above I would like to say that a financial support is not a main reason why American and British cinema industry have a such popularity. There are many other reasons but the main one is a good quality of prodused film, its actors and developed plot with the idea wich makes spectators to think over this film again and again...",60,2,0

The selling of eBooks in 2014 in such countries like Germany and China are less comparing to USA. We can also see that selling of eBooks will probably increase in all countries presented in the chart. Print market will lose leading positions in all countries to eBook market in all presented countries. It is also important to mention that the most profitable market is print market and it will remain leading in a near future.
The markets of eBook and print book are to remain stable, while USA will have a rapid increase in selling in 2018. We can consider that Germany and China are more old-fashioned countries than USA. Meanwhile the markets in the UK will have steady decreasing in selling eBooks and steady increasing in selling print. The same with Germany and China.
So, it is clear from the chart that there will be changes in development of markets, but there is rather rough forecast.

So, they are particularly right but most of cases happen because of psychology and innormal nervous system. However, humn who killed somebody or make any other hard crime deal must be urgent isolated out of the population because he is dangerous for people. As for the second group of people, they are sure that if human made a mistake one in the past and moved out of the law, it is necessary to give him an opportunity to stay on the right way by living with normal humanable conditions out of freedom certainly. For instance, Norway’s and Sweden’s governments use that method, so prisons in these countries seems like a well – designed modern flats with TV and access to the internet with some restrictions.

Why is it so? Let us investigate this problem.
First of all, we all live in the age of globalization. All cultures become slightly closer to each other. Some scientists even claim that there are no longer any local cultures, as all of them have been replaced with one global culture. Though, parts which different countries take in this global culture are known not to be equal. British and American cultures have influenced other cultures a lot. That is why nowadays people watching films prodused in these countries or reading books written there are indeed connected with that global culture more than those who do not.
The second reason for people to watch British or American films rather than locally produced ones is that the first, as I personally believe, are more mass-oriented. What I mean by this is that films prodused there do not contain any hidden sense (though some films might pretend to do so, but, in my opinion, it is only a strategy to please someparticular kinds of spectators). The logic of British and American films is quite clear (in comparison to, let us say, Custuritsa's or Kislyovsky's films). It is also possible to say that people do not need to think a lot or to solve some puzzles to completely understand these films. And this strategy works perfectly, as people nowadays like watching films mostly in oder to relax and give their minds some rest.
To conclude, modern globalized culture cituation and general attitude to films are realy favorable for films prodused in Britain and America, as under these circumstances people tend to watch them instead of locally produced films.",70,2,1

There are a huge amount of developments in different spheres. The reason of it is globalization. That is why, modern technologies are developing every moment. One of the significant step for development is the space exploration.
Many people don't disagree with this statement, because they are sure that space exploration is not the urget problem in soceity. First of all, we face to poverty in different countries. Unfortuntaly, governments don't decide this problem . For example, the level of poverty is nearly 70 percent and the government don't take any actions. Secondly, another main problem is environment. The amount of rubbish increases every day. The level of deforestation and air and water pollution is awfully high. However, most governments spent money on deciding this problem. There are new alluminium boxes for separating rubbish in the streets. For example, in Norwegia appears the system of punishment. If you drop the bottle on the ground, soon you will get a paper with a sum, which you should pay. The environment issues in some countries are controlled. But turn to the main question of rational spending money.
However, nowadays governments try to control the situation in the countries. And now they want to explore the space. On the one side, it is a sensible act. Exploration the space can lead to the new technologies. Maybe soon there new facilities for living or even existing appear. A new brach of travelling will develop. Some people think that spending money on space exploration could be better decision. However, I can't agree with this statement, because it demands a huge sum of money, whereas spending money on medicine and poverty are more cheaper. Moreover, there is a risk that nothing helps to space exploration. For example, special equipment could break and governments will waste money. But if they spent it for other exsitional issues it will help people.
To sum up, I would like to say that government should spend money on main living issues.",60,2,2

Although I do not consider this situation to be right, I agree with the statement and I can suspend that there are many important reasons for this.

Firstly, many countries trying to produce films are not able to spent so much money on this process as the USA and Great Britain. They merely do not have so much money. Because of this financial situation, local films there cannot include really amazing special effects like the Hollywood's movies have. Fortunately or unfortunately, for majority of modern people the absence of special effects is a considerable film's disatvantage, so their preference of colourful British and American pictures is obvious.

Secondly, the local directors oftenly try to show something special about their countries and so do their target auditory much smaller, because not many people are able and ready to understand another culture.

However, I am sure that local film industry is one of the symbols of each country and, of course, needs for government's financial support. It is not a secret that the process of globalization reaches its peak now, but it is not normal that cultures smaller and poorer than Amrican or Briain have to go down. Local films can save it and show their own reality for the whole world.

To conclude, it is fact that local film industries are less popular even in countries they have been produced, but I am sure that government with their money can save their culture.",60,2,3

Female can see some detales, that are hidden from males' eye; but women ,as a rule, are too emotional, that does not allow them to analize particular situations. Men in this matter are more sutable.

Some people say that governments should decrease the number of air trips. Others claim that air travel is necessary business and leisure. To begin with, sometimes the air space is “overcrowded” by flying planes, what definitely leads to air pollution. On websites like flightradar24.com everyone can watch each plane on the Earth and can learn necessary information about its’ destination, height speed and so on. This site can show that regions like Europe and North America are “invisible” behind the plane sign on the radar. There are many positive planes, which are used for business travel or for transportation some VIP persons. To reduce the number of these planes governments have to introduce the special law that lets use private air travel only with a permission. Another problem of large amount of air travel is dispatch work. When there too many planes in one region it is very difficult to dispatch to control the situation. Sometimes the overpressure lead to wrong decision and, consequently, to plane crash. In summer of 2002, in Germany the dispatch, who had to watch after two regions, made a mistake, which lead to collision of two planes and 70 victims, including so children. That is why number of air travel should be reduced in terms of safety. However, in different regions planes are frequently used to protecting the nature from disasters like fires, apposite, have to been increased. In many possible way of travelling that is why it can nt be abandoned in there. To sum up, the development in technologies improves many industries including air travel. Making better qualities and characteristics of planes will probably makes them less harmful to the extremal area and will reduce their amount in the air.

To my mind, space exporation costs us way too much. Before exploring the outer space, we should deal with the issues on our planet firstly. For instance, the problem of world hunger remains unsolved to this day and money should be spent on the people who starve, because lives of millions of people are valuable. More than that, there are also many issues related to the state of the planet itself. Even if we could conquer another planet, we would not be able to live there. This is why we should be more focused of resolving enviromental problems. The Earth is our home and we should take care of it.

This essay has a purpose to deal with the question ""should athlets, who used drugs, be isolated from the competitons forever or for a limited period of time?"" Before provide my own opinion, I intend to discuss both views on this issue.
The first point of view is that atleth should not be punnished forever, and the punishement as limited period is enough. Some sportsmens realised their mistakes and stoped cheeting. For instance, there was a runner, who was caught in the international competiotion, but he underwent a course of reabilitation and now he don't use any drugs.
The other opinion is that the atleth should be banned from competing proffessionally for the rest of their lives. Some people never changes and can't understand their own mistakes. This kind of people don't wont be fair. For example, their was a case in local competion. A jumper was caught using illegal medicaments. Therefore, She was banned from competion for two years. However, when she returned to proffesion sport, she was caught again.
However, it is my opinion that people should not be very sever by judjing these athlets. I also suppose, that four years is enough for them to realise their mistakes.
To sum up, there is several views on this question. Some people believe that time limited bann is enough, others think that is not. Although, there are athlets who will be cheeting forever inspite of bann limited punishment. I personally suppose that four year isolation from proffesional competion is enough for them to realise their mistakes.

Some people suppose that the large number of sports facilities is a key to solve the problem . At the same time, others do not agree with it. The first thing that need to be said is the quality is more important than quantity. The quality of sport facilities depends on government’s decisions. Secondly, another measure to improve public health is popularization of sports facilities at whole. For example, if the government of south country provides a comfortable and convience residence for hockey, it does not mean that this kind of sports will be popular in this country. However, another side of the coin is increasing number of sports facilities. Some people do believe that the large number will provide the development of sport’s situation.

Air travel one of the causes of air pollution and global warming. And someone thinks that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, that is why governments should regulate tha amount of air travel for business and leisure by laws. We should discuss several points of view and try to find answer. On the one hand, air travel make a negative influence on the atmosphere such as air pollution and may be ozone holes. In long term it ill be dangerous for all people and that is why governments ought to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. For example, they can introduce quotes for air travel on the other hand, there are a lot of different things that provides air pollution and global warming more than air travel for example, cars and volcans. About the influence of cars, we know but not everyone knows that after the booming voulcan’s gas pollute the air more than cars and air travelling in comparison for several years, and its is one of  the main reason of global warming. Air travel is new way of transport and there are not so many air travelling. I think that there are different reasons of air also have to be regulated by government. In conclusion I think that both of view should be realized. I mean control of air travel in long term period and including different ways of reducing the rate of air pollution and global warming.

Nowadays such a process is possible due to globalization. To my mind, there are two ideas of the coin.  On the one hand, companies’ moving has some advantages. To start with the work force in developing countries is much cheaper than in developed ones. Therefore, companies’ owners have the opportunity to spend extra money on improving work conditions or on advertising. In addition to this, renting office or building it is more expensive in developed countries than in developing ones usually because of the lack of materials or space. In than case, international companies can use cheaper developing countries’ buildings and spend extra money on improving workers’ qualification, for example. On the other hand, that tendency also has some disadvantages. The first one is the fact that developed countries’ workers are out of the opportunity to be the part of international companies and to gain useful experience. The second drawback is the fact that local employees usually are worse educated than workers from Europe or the USA. That can cause a language barrier problem which can in result reduce the efficiency of company’s work. To sum up, I think disadvantages overweigh advantages. From my viewpoint decision to move a company or not depend on its sphere. For instance, if an international company specialized in medicine, it will be great to relocate it to India because this sphere is well developed in that country. But I am sure that when a company owner wants only to reduce the amount of money spent on salaries, the work of his company will not be effective.

Such difference is produces by controversial beliefe that longer cuprisonment sentences would lead to reduction of crime level. There are some arguments for and against, wich I try to explain. As my own opinion, I think both options are possible. To begin with, let’s take United States as an example, as recent studies shown, those, who commited a crime once, are more likely to do it once again, despite of punishment on threat of it. Based on this research some states entered the “tough” way of reducing crimes: for every next crime you get longer prison sentence, up to permanent for the third or fourth even insignificant crime. Indeed, this had reduced the crime levels, but possibly brought other drawbacks, such as making population more aggressive, wich may only exacerbate the problem. Another way of fighting crime is worth considering. Some people think that the key fighting violence is giving people proper education and bring up. Prisons should teach people do live in healthy society, rather than separate them from it. This caring, soft approach involves shorter prison sentences and comfortable living conditions in jail, along side with efforts do minimize any violence in society at all. In theory this should lead do less people become burglars, thiefs, murders, etc. in the first place and as a result, less budget spent on punishment facilities. To summarise, each method has its prospekts and consequences and may be applied in different situations. I think that different methods may be suitable for different countries. Though “soft approach” may be more desirable, it’s way more hard to bring into being and thus only suitable for highly organized society.

As far as I am concenred, there are two main causes of such a phenomenon. They are lack of attention towards young people and the increase in the amount of cruelty around them.
First, there are many parents working a lot, so that they cannot pay a lot of attention to their children. In this case kids do not get enough moral education, and a lack of that can result into a child becoming cruel, as he or she does not know what good and bad is.
Also, such kids can feel underloved by their parents, which can contribute to their future violence. In addition, there is an unbelievable amount of external cruelty around kids these days. They watch movies and play computer games that consist mostly of scenes of shooting, and other types of harrasment. Spending their leisure time this way causes problems with moral standards and extreme violence. All the aformentioned factors result into yound people growing up very violent, which is one of the key factors of the increase in the number of crimes committed by young people.
As this issue is extremely important for the society, parents and teachers definitely should do something to decrease the level of kids' cruelty to prevent them from becoming criminals. The most important thing they can do is to pay more attention towards children's development and their moral education. Kids should be taught about good and bad from the very young age, and they should feel that they are cared about. In this way, they will be much less likely to experience willingness to commit a crime. In order to reach such a goal, parents and teachers should control the media products that children consume to avoid the situation, in which they watch horrors only. They should suggest that children read more books and watch more movies that will establish right moral values an teach them how to behave.
To sum up, more crimes commited by young people are caused by the huge amount of violence affecting them, which comes from both media products they tend to consume and from the lack of their parents' attention. As a solution to this issue I suggest that parents and teachers should pay more attention towards kids and try to establish moral values and teach them about good and bad from the very young age.

There are hooligans who break the glass of windows in classes, who talk to teachers rudely, and using sometimes dirty, inappropriate words, who kick their classmates. Parents and teachers ask physchologists for help hoping that these specialists will give answer – why do some students behave not so great?

A variety of different researches had given some results, and now specialists explain the reasons of bad behaviour in next ways (which, I agree with): for example, they say, hooligans are victims of their personal problems – being heartbroken, experiencing the parents’ divorce. Physchologists note that young girls and boys (especially, teenagers) go through such problems with difficulties – they give full or anger, hatred, sorrow and etc. speaking about example for this, we can remember the frontman of rock-group “Nirvana” who became angry at the people around, cynic after his mother and father had broken up.

Another reason which is noted by specialists is a wish to seem better, stronger for somebody (boys fight, girls look at the winner). If you want an example, we can remember the film “Back to Future” – Marty Mcfly’s father was threeted by his classmate, Biff Tannen, who wanted to be the strangest boy for girls around him and his company.

How to solve this problem? In my opinion, mothers and fathers should speak with their children and try to help them instead of ignoring. They are ought to anticipate the risk of turning into hooligan and don't let kids solve any difficulties with fists, kicks, weapons, murders. And for kids… They must believe to their nearest and dearest.

According to theme, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, I believe that moving business in poor and developing countries has more cons. On the one hand, moving business in developing countries helps governments to understand how to make international shipping, and, moreover, helps to rise the level of economy. Furthermore, it can cause better developing in country than career. For example, is 80’s Vietnam was developing countries, but during that decade this country rise the level of economy’s sphere, becoming one of the biggest country of export in South-Asian region, because many international companies move business to this countries and employ vietnamies. On the other hand, it has bad effects on local citizens. When international companies open their business in developing countries, it decline native business and also can destroy the country’s economy. Moreover, I truly believe that, it also can influence on international policy, and can cause polician war. Nevertheless, many local workers who are employing for working often do not want to work for immigrant derictory. For instance, German company moved business to China. First years of working the company was misunderstanding why employees do not want to work. Only after three month later they understand than Chinese always need breakfast at 12 o’clock. In conclusion, I would like to say that moving business to poorer, developing countries has more advantages and disadvantages, however international companies should forget about difference between countries and its investment.

In modern world the problem of criminality among teenagers became sharp question and triggered a lot of discussions. In this essay I’d like to reflect different views on this problem from the point of its development and the solution of the problem.
First of all, many people say that the reason of teenage criminality is the development of internet and technology, which allows youngsters buy guns and cold-weapons without any control. Moreover, the growth of popularity of violent content in TV-stream, movies and computer games make children copy vicious behavior and demonstrate aggression. As addition, children became more vulnerable before the face of anxiety and loneliness, which trigger a lot of problems with communication and the desire to be cruel and violent to people as a result.
The question of how to prevent such behavior is raised on the governmental level nowadays, but teachers and parents should obviously take part in solving this problem. First of all, parents should spend more time with their children to know their interests and intentions. What is more, they should help children to move through their personal doubts, frustration and other psychological problems to low down the level of aggression. As for the teachers, they should solve the conflicts between students in peaceful way and conduct debates and team-building activities. Not only should adults teach children maths and grammar, they should also teach them how to be tolerant and keep calm.
All in all, the problem of teenage criminality have its roots in the indifference of adults, who let the internet to be the best and the only friend of their kids. Every adult, no matter whether has he children or not, is to contribute in peace and stability of this world.",70,2,1

As we live in liberal world, full of rights, that helps induviduals live freedom and happy, a chance to the artists to create anything in anyway should be protected.

Nowadays, illegal using of music content is a real problem, because of many difficulties, which sfufols us opposite producers as opposite usual people.

There are some opinions which I can agree with, but, of course, I can not state, that it is true. Firstly, the main result of producing and selling pirate copies is that musicians and producers lose money, and really huge summs. So, it means that it can be not enough money for next projects.

No one can deny that it looks like a robbery. The second point, which I can support, is the fact, that pirates can use musical and film copies for selling and make illegal money, which is criminal in many developed countries.

It is clearly seen, that everybody use illegal copies of music and films sometimes. And mostly such content is free, that is why so much people use and share it. You do not need to spend your money to watch a movie once. It is the main reason of such huge amount of pirate sources. Also, it is rather convenient to download a song, for instance, once and free and use it without any limits on any device.

So, two first facts shows that I agree with the fact of punishment, because producers and musician lose much money and can not invest it in their new projects. The next two facts of the charge and convenience shows that I am such a criminal, a pirate as other Internet users.

To sum up, I can state, that the punishment should be realized only for big criminals, for creating special pirate sites with stolen original content. But it should not be punished, when somebody downloaded an illegal content for his own using, only for home watching or listening. But the punishment should be for spreading and sharing illegal files.

Most of them are trying to that in order to attract their parents' attention. As a solution, I would like to suggest parents to be more attentive to their child, to speak more, to discuss their daily problems. It could really help teenager not to feel him/herself abandone and alone. Moreover, the access to internet and other sources in which child could see violence should not be free.Parents should limit it in soft way and to give their children explanation of their action.
Another important issue is that nowadays crime became popular and even encouraged by social media. Every day teenagers watch different TV-shows, movies, play games consisted of violence.They take it as an example to follow and begin to repeat actions the saw. As a solution I would like to offer social networks and social media at all to restrict their materials and their content, not to allow to public materials which include crime. Children should see only good examples on the screen to bring it to reality. For example they could introduce more programms about sport or healthy way life, stories of different succeful people and people whose lives were ruined because of their criminal past.
To sum up, I would like to say that crime can really ruin and spoil our society. However, more and more teenagers are becoming involved in it. Those young people are our future and that is why we should not let them become criminals.Howbeit, it should be done in a nice manner in order not to be too strict but understanding and supporting.",65,2,0

The other points of view are also taking place in our society.  From one point of view it might be helpful to prolong prison sentences. The statistics shows us that a large number of ex-prisoners returns to the criminal world after the sentence. It is also obvious that many killers have mental disorders which can not be cured. In this way we give freedom to the potential maniac.  From the other point of view there might be another ways to reduce crimes. It is not so obvious but prisons were created not for the punishment but fo helping people to change themselves. Such statement encourages society to invent more helpful ways to reduce crimes. For example it may be special courses at school. It is well-known fact that criminal addiction has been developing during the puberty. The other alternative way to reduce crimes is to stand high moral standards in the society. I want to say that only the criminal has an ability to stop the crime and the society only can help him.  To sum it up It is worth saying that alternative ways of reducing crimes could me more effective then prolonging prison sentences. First it is more effective to reduce criminal thoughts in the society then inflection on the real acts. If the only reason not to commit a crime is a long prison sentence it may be uneffective. Beeing in an unstable condition potential criminal could commit a crime and thoughts about the prison could not help him. The other disability of such way to reduce crimes is corruption. The criminal could prevent himself from the prison with the help of his money.  ,60,2,0

Let’s consider the advantage and disadvantage og this problem. The cous of it is that  we haven’t need to spend a lot of money for movies, music. You can download many albums of your favorite groups, watching huge qualities of movie and haven’t pay attention of your money. By the other hand, it’s not right for people, who made this, because they send huge money, their times to produce it and for them it’s job. I think is unfair for them.

A big period of time in Russia there are was a lot of pirate copies. Teenagers could download their loweliest music from difference sociealy like VK  or some web sites like torrent and musician and producers losed enormous money on it. 

Finally, I think that people have to pay for their downloads.

Gap year it is a year between finishing high school and starting university studies, usually young people are working or travelling in this time. So, there are different points of view about having this year.
On the one hand, some people consider that all youths should have a gap year. Their reasons are that in this time people can get a lot of experience for their future study and work. For example, if person is travelling, he might learn some foreign languages and culture. And if the person is working, he can get some skills, which will be necessary in their future job. 
On the other hand, there is a different point of view that young people should enter a university after finishing high school without having a gap year. People who support this opinion are sure that after such a long pause (having a gap year) it will be very complicated to start studying again. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that I support the second point of view and my reason is the same – such a long pause as a gap year can interfere young people from study in normal way.

In my opinion, I agree with this statement. High modern technologies lead to illnesses and health troubles, which sometimes are quite hard to solve.
One of the greatest problems of health, connected with modern lifestyle, is bad eye-seeing. Nowadays a lot of people use gadgets, read from them all the time. That is the reason, why so many children and adults have to use glasses to see. Another health problem, caused by modern technologies, is weak spine. Today people work a lot and at work they have to sit all the day long near the computer at the office. So, sitting work leads to weak back musclues.
All of theese problems can be redused in some ways. First of all, parents should not allow their children to use gadgets very often, time for computer games and texting ought to be limited. Moreover, adult people need to do some sports, at least some excercises. It will strenghen their bodies and health in general Finally, the government can launch the social advertisement and create some program about importance of healthcare and reducing of using of technologies. Sport and healthcare have to become fashionable and popular among all the population.
To sum up, today people have a lot of health troubles connected with their lifestyle, So, that is very important to reduce theese troubles and create an environment, where people can use technologies less and care about their health more.

Sport area is not the exeption. A problem of drug consumption is harsh and some people suppose that athlets that were suspected in taking pills should not be allowed to participate in sport competitions at all, while others want them to be banned for a limited period of time.
Temporary prohibition to sportsmen from participating in competitions demonstrated humanity and respect to people, who are under drastic pressure and want to be a winner no matter what, hence they want to increase their chances. Athlets could also been given pills by their coaches and even government officialls so they agreed to take them against their will. Temporary ban may improve this situation, because athlets don't want to lose precious time.
Ban for the rest of live is the strictest form of punishment and may be the only solution to solve drug problem since the sportsman will have no choice. Career is believed to be so much worth than undoubtably perfect result. Such a measure will definitely restore faith of the society in the honesty and transparency of sport competitions, especially the Olympics; which was widely disregarded after the series of scandals involving drug usage by whole teams at particular kind of sport. Although it may not be fair - humanism states that people should be given second chances.
In my opinion, the duration of such a ban should be connected with the motives of sportsmen. If the athlet took a drug only one out of the team, he or she should be given limited prohibition due to his or her right to be treated as a human, who is allowed to make one mistake. When the drug case is against several athlets of particular team of the one country - they have to be banned for life since that is nothing, that state - sponsored dopping compaign. Incidents with common dopping should be punished heavily due to make spot fair and transparent again.

I am not agree with this state, because in my opinion globalization is  a must for well-being of the whole world. 

Firstly, it is because of the fact that country may not have a territory that would allow to grow food for all population. For example, Monaco has a very small territory and a big number of people living there. So, the only way to have enough sources for all humans is to trade with other countries and to import products.

Secondly, the country’s climate is the main factor for good agricultural policy. If the weather is good all over the year then it is not the problem to provide the population with food, because you can seed all the year. However, if it is a cold winter, you are not able to grow food all the time. The situation in northern countries such as Canada, Russia, Sweden is very similar to this argument. 

Finally, the country need to have a very good and developed factories to make deliscious and high-quality food that people will enjoy, This needs a lot of money and it is more expensive than buying food from other countries.

First of all, such spheres like ingeneering or informatics are very complicated for women, and more less women than men want to study them. So, it will be hard to universities find and teach equal numbers of males and females in these spheres.

Secondly, most of teachers are women. Of course, it is clear that men must have an opportunity to get teacher’s education, but universities cannot provide equal numbers of men and women.

Many people suggest that this situation many lead to many harmful consequences while other consinsider it as absolutely normal and acceptable. In this essay I will try to analyse this case in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.
To begin with, local small businesses cannot disappear at all. First of all, they are really cosy and it is pleasant for many people to visit such cute places. Furthermore, the link between seller and the client is established and it is vital for many people because they can ask for a piece of advice or recommendation what to buy or whether the good is fresh or not. Aditionally, such local shops can offer us fresh goods which possess better quality.
However, these pluses of local buisnesses can be argued. So, the goods in local shops can be quite expensive and not everyone could afford some kinds of meat or natural dairy products presented there. Futhermore, it is believed that it is not so convenient to buy products in many different places rather than go to supermarket and buy everything that is required at one place. It is well known that nowadays it is possible to buy so many diverse products in supermarkets, from bread to pens and pencils, notebooks for school and even clothes. In such popular supermarket as IKEA people can buy furniture, food and everything that is needed. Additionally, you can have a lunch at the cafe nearby. I assume that for adults with children this option is preferable. Then, it is a special room in the building where the supermarket is located for kids to play and have fun while their parents do shopping. I guess that with our rapid pace of life this variats are convenient and can help save time and energy.
Overall, to sum up I would like to add that in our life we shold opt for comfort and time managment because we have a lack of free time that is why global international brands can benefit.",65,2,0

In this essay I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this situation.
The most obvious drawback of local businesses is the fact that they cannot provide enough working places for people in need. Because of such situation the level of economics in the particular region declines. For example, in small Russian villages it is far better to build a chain store of large international brand than local family shop, as citizens will get more working places with higher salaries.
On the other hand the development of small businesses has its bright sides and benefits. Nowadays, it is a widespread thing, that goods produced in local markets are often better than in popular chain stores, as small businesses are more customer-oriented. For instance, it is better to buy dairy products at the small farmer shop, than in a big supermarket, as food will be fresher and tastier .Moreover, these local businesses and small shops are just more pleasant places to visit, as they treat their customers differently. Each customer will receive enough help and attention, and, probably, will feel himself as a part of the family. In many local shops assistants know each customer personally and know their specific needs, so they can satisfy these needs easier.
To conclude, despite the fact that small businesses have some drawbacks, it is essential to help them to develop, as they often produce far better goods for consumers.",65,2,1

In addition, feminists opened this opportunity for women and many woman have job nowadays. That is why both parents work and do not sit with their children. It can be dangerous for kids, first of all, because kids spend time with internet, their environment, for example with othe kids on dangerous occasions. Secondly, the child can have psychological problems without parents’ communication, he can close the door to other people in his soul. However, many people see advantages of this. For example, children can be more serious with others or can find decisions in hard life situations. To sum up, children’ psychological state depends on their parents.

In 2008 food products were leading in an average amount of goods which were transported by road. Comparing two charts, it can be concluded that manufactured goods were transported both by rail and by road in the same amount.

Chart two shows that machinery goods takes the least percent of goods transported by road, while this kind of goods was successfully transported by rail – it took 12% of an all amount of goods transported this way. 

As it can be concluded  from the comparison of two charts, different goods need different ways of transportation. For example, it is more comfortable and less expensive to transport machinery goods by rail, then by road, so this is why two ways of transportation have different percent numbers of different transported goods during the same period.

Firstly, art is not goods. People make art because they want to share with others theirs ideas and knowledges. Artist, musicians or film directors do not think about money, if they have true talants. They earn money from other job, not from art.

Sport activities can help people to ease stress tension and to be full of beans. More than that, children are more likely to take up an active life-style while spending time with their main role models - parents in available sport facilities.

First of all, it is pain in eyes. Office workers, who are working with a computer during the whole day are usually feeling terrible pain in their eyes. Eyes become dry and red, people see worse and have to wear glasses. I have such a problem, myself. Making a lot of home assignments on computer, I started to see worse and now I have to wear glasses.

Secondly, another big health problem could be caused by radiation produced by computers. It is scientifically proved that if you always put computer on your stomach, you may have problems with degestive and genital systems. The radiation is very harmful and you need to be very careful and make a rest during long work.

Thirdly, mordern technology allow to listen to a very good music. But everybody forget about the volume. If you listen to music very loudly, it may lead to deafness. Many young people don’t understand that, what makes them hear worse. It is very importaint to choose right headphose, that perfectly suit you and don’t harm your ear.

To sum up, I should say, that health problems caused by mordern technologies are very importaint. Every person should carefully look after his health and the health of his friends and relatives. Because radiation can cause cancer, pregnancy problems and other deseases.

The information about the type of the  countries and the money they spent on the renewable energy is presented in the bar chart. It is obvious that developing countries spent more money every year and the amount of their investments rose from $ 25 Bn to $ 100 Bn in 2006 and 2012 respectively. Unfortunately, there was a slight fall in 2013 when the amount of investments was oly about $ 80 Bn.

An example to support the thesis is an increasing number of teenagers with problems of the sight. Moreover, the environment has tendency to deteriorate that will lead to diseases of people.

For example, through taxes number of cars would be decreased and issue of pollution will be resolved in some extent. Furthermore, people should controlled the behaviour of their children.

I think, that severe punishment for such minor offence is irrelevant.
Firstly, the price of seeking these deliquents would exceed the amount of reasonable fee for this crime. I think, that every government has more important things to spend money on. Secondly, the harm from pirates is not so high – if it was, Misicians, film producers and others would simply stop producing, as their lousses would exceed their incomes. I do not see this happening. Then, it is not pirates and other consumers who have to adjust. Supplier must make his product attractive and easy to use, instead of trying to fight on the battlefield with nobody but them left – let’s face the reality, no one used discs today. I do not have nor computer with disc driver, neigher TV. So how am I supposed to use these discs? Producers must meet me halfway on the internet, creating convenient and useful on-line resources with their production, and I will buy subscription with a great pleasure, as I am tired of spending hours in search for a video with a proper sound and quality to download from torrents before watching any film.
To sum up I would say that I do not think that sharing and copying intellectual properties on the Internet is a crime or any kind of offence, neigher I think it should be controlled by the governmental structures. As any relations concerning purchasing same product this case must be regulated by supply – demand law. I’m sure that seeing the problem in proper way will help consumers to get what they want, producers – to earn their money and goventment – to not waist time and resources on irrelevant things.

Overall the changes in shares of the given companies’ revenues, which are Apple, Samsung, Blackberry and HTC, are quite diverse, however in overall we can group them into halves by the following trends: the ever-decreasing share of profit (Blackberry and HTC) and differentiative trend of the revenue shares’ changes (Apple and Samsung). The most profitable smartphone producer of all is Apple with higest share of revenue reaching 70% in 2012 and 90% in 2015. We can assume that Apple is a leading company of the industry in terms of the revenue approach. Apple suffered from the slight decrease in it’s share only in 2013 when it dropped from 70 to 60% in 2013, whereas the share of Samsung increased from 40 to 45% in 2012 during the exact same period of time. Hence, Apple and Samsung might be considered to be the closest opponents on the given market. The other two companies – Blackberry and HTC – never had had a considerable revenue share from 2010 to 2015 while it was ranging from 0 to 5% for Blackberry and 15-5% for HTC. The main tendency for these companies is the plunge of the profit percentage from 2011 to 2015, in which the aforementioned producers followed the same pattern of their revenue shares’ change. Overall, the shares of all companies were growing from 2010 to 2012 (from 40 to 70% for Apple, from 15 to 45% for Samsung, from 10 to 15 for HTC, and the stable 20% give or take for Blackberry). However, from the point of 2011 until the recent times (2015) the pattern of changes for the profit shares of Samsung and Apple have become completely oppositional. If Apple reaches it’s peak at 90% share of profit in 2015, Samsung gets to it’s lowest point of 15% around the same time.

But different people have different meanings for happiness. I think that there is one min reason why it is so hard to define a word “happiness”. I suppose that there are few factors that helps people to be happy.
Firstly, I will try to suggest why happiness may have different meanings. Everyone wants to be happy but everyone understands it differently. To my mind, this problem occurs because there are so many countries and cultures in the world and every culture has its own understanding of happiness. For example I have a friend who thinks that the only way which leads to happiness is to be with God. He is very religious what is quite surprising for modern society.
Me and my parent consider happiness as something what helps you to feel free: an education. Me and my friend was brought up in different cultures that is why we have different understanding of the world happiness.
Secondly, I would mention some factors wich can help to achieve happiness. For instance, it is health, because if you  are unhealthy the only thing you think of is how to stop pain. 
The second place goes to having healthy friends and relatives, because you always love them and wish them the best. And the third thing is wealthyness. Money is important because they help you to get education, broaden your mind by travelling and buy expensive medicals in some cases.
In conclusion I would like to stress that happiness is something what is understood differently by people from different cultures. But there are some key factors that are always essential.

Some people think that illegal copying of music or films should be regarded as theft and be punished in the same way. But it does not seem unreasonable to believe that copying has nothing in common with the real theft.
The strongest arguement in favour of this position is that such art works as songs, films and books should be spread around the world as wide as it possible instead of being restricted to copy. It is supposed that the Internet should provide people an opportunity to see what they cannot see live or to hear what they cannot hear in the concerthall. Nevertheless, the copyright legislation does not conduce films or songs of any time be recongnised in the whole world without charging any fee.
Although the idea of free copying and sharing music and films seems to be very attractive, It cannot be ignored that to create art is someone’s job and he or she earns for living this way. Pirate copies make them loose their money regardless how much a producer or a musician earns.
Taking into account everything that was mentioned it can be concluded that despite the fact that copyright legislation is very important as it protects producers and musicians, it should not be so straightforward and regard copying as a crime. Measures should be taken to make laws concerning the copyright not so strict and harsh.

This theme is highly debated in the social media and news. Some people are of the opinion that this (illigal copying) is theft, and I am compleatly agree with this people. In this essay I am going to discuss why copying and sharing music and films is a fraud.
Firstly, I sould say that this activity is illigal and there is nothing to discuss why free sharing is a theft. Scientists say that 15 per cent of young people (people of age under 25 years) are in jail due to this kind of fraud. In this way, if you are tring to sublish any pirate copies on the internet you are risking to get to the prison.
Secondly, if you are a internet pirate you are stealing from a seledrity person. On the other hand, if you are downloading any content from the internet, your favorit music, for example, you are stealing from your favorit musician or if you are downloading a film, you are stealing from your favorit actor or actris.
Some people could say that the amout of people who are able to pay for the music and films is lower than 50 per cent. May be it is true but we should anderstand that there are a lot of programs which gives an opportunity to by something for free or with a big discount. This programs are avalible for poor people, umenployed and for students.
To sum up, I sould say that pirote copies of music and films are illigal and unmoral. I hope that pirote copies will stop exist in the nearest future.

Firstly, the percentage of population in all of the observed countries will increase significantly to the period of the 2040-s. For example, in Japan which will leave the highest proportion of people aged 65 and more 27%, this amount will rise on almost 22% in the comparison with 1940.

Some people say that athletes caught using illegal drugs should leave professional competing for the rest of their lives, others are sure that a limited period of banning of those athletes is enough. This essay will discuss both positions and state the one with wich the autor agrees.
The idea of banning athletes using drugs for the rest of their lives has its right to exist. First of all, because sport is about discipline - and following the rules. Furtermore, professional sports are just about hardworking and leaving the cheating athletes in professional sports, even after 2 years of banning, would be a disrespect of lifelong work of those, who never used illegal drugs and achieved high result by their own forces. Finally, sportsmen have to be an example for society, especially for youngmen and kids, inspiring them to work hard on their roads to success, so banning drug-using athletes forever could prevent a decrease of moral and motivation between future generations.
However, every person has a right to make a bad decision someday - we are all people, with our own vices and passions. So those, who are for banning cheating sportsmen for a limited period are also right. This sort of restriction is promoting the humanity, wich is a basic idea of any big competition. It also translates to society a very important idea, that we all have a chance to correct the faults of our past and have a prospering future.
To conclude, I would like to say that both these views are relevant, but I agree withe the second one. Professional sport competitions, like Olimpic games, are not about winning: they are about being people, wherever you come from and whoever you are. And I'am pretty sure that there is nothing as important for a human being, than giving each other a chance.

Some people hold a view that people doing it should be punished while others do not support them. From my point of view, the second position is right.
First of all, there is the fact, that some people, for example, children or teenagers cannot afford to buy music albums or films to themselves. Therefore, they do not have chance to listen or watch it. What is more, musicians and film producers can loose money not from illegal pirate copies but from the situation when people will not know about them. This is actually about musicians and producers that are at the begining of their career. They need to use all possible channels to become more popular and the lack of access will not let them to do it.
However, there are some problems with illegal copying. The first one is that popular film makers and musicians do not get all the income they can. Therefore, the cannot make new films or music because they are lack of money. The second one is that sometimes they do not understand how popular they really are as there is no evidance or statics about people downloading it.
These problems can be actually solved. As a solution producers and musicians can allow to download some of their products for free and ask money for some other. What is about the second problem, to my mind, it can be solved in connection with the first one. People will listen or watch films for free and want to buy some else.
To sum up, illegal copying and sharing music and films is not such a big crime for that people should be punished in some way.

I disagree with it and in this essay I will explain why buying the original discs is not a good alternative and why the music and film idustries need to concentrate on the free trade.

Firstly, the amount of money that musicians and producers receive depends most of all on the amount of people who will perceive their content. Most of people do not want to spend their money on such things and if the only way for them would be to buy the song or movie, they could refuse to do that. So, the producers will lose half of their audience and as a result receive less money. As an example of the dependence between audience and producer’s money, we can take the situation when the creators of the movie spend a lot of money to make it, and when the movie is released and becomes not so popular among people, the directors and producers receive less money then they have spent. The same situation can happen in the Internet. So paying for the original discs is not in the interest of the creators of them, first of all. 

Secondly, the technologies are becoming more and more advanced, the ways of sharing free files are becoming more broad. So, the strict rules and sanctions would lead just to another ways of looking for free materials, that could even harder to control. It is better to create a legal free system of downloading files and be aware of how it works. So it will be easier for the movies’ and musical industries to control it. Like in Russia we have a lot of free websites to watch the movies, and th companies make money from the advertisment that shows while you’re watching something for free.

All in all, in my opinion, there are many ways for film and music producers to gain money and people shouldn’t pay for the songs and movies, when they are doing at home and not going to the cinema or concert.

However, there are ongoing debates about whether or not exploring the space is a good way to spend money, if society has many problems of its own.
I do not agree with the opinion that spending money on space is useless. First of all, science in general and particularly the exploring of space can find the solutions for urgent problems on Earth by looking for an alternative places of living, for example. Secondly, money put in this type of research helps scientists understand the processes that are taking place on Earth, which leads to progress that we all want to achieve. It is very important if we want to continue develop and gather knowledge about what is happening around us and, most importantly, why this is happening. Finally, space exploration gives people jobs and careers, as well as any other types of jobs.
Nevertheless, many people have different take on this topic. They think that cutting off money spent on space exploration means that they will be put on solving urgent problems, such as poverty, even though it is not how economy works. Also, they do not see the benefits that space science gives us on solving these environmental issues. However, it is clear that many data about the structure and changes of Earth come directly from work that is being done while researching the space.
Overall, evolution of humankind and solving the problems on Earth can only come hand in hand with the development of science, especially the exploration of space.",70,2,1

Secondly, there is another reason why people should not travel by plane and it is safety of travel. There has been a lot of researches carried out to state that air travel is one of the most dangerous ways of travel, if not the retual least safe. Even though for cars, for example, situation is about the same, trains are considered safe and water transport too.
Hawever, facts stoled above do not undo the understanding of another one. Air travelling is proven to be the most convenient, as plains allow us to reach any country we want, regardless of the borders or territorial difficulties like mountains.
All in all, people should take care of nature and the environment more than they care about themselves as a person. In other words time saved on comfortable conditions undo the damage to ecology caused by aur travelling. And that is why the amount of air travel should be reduced.

Therefore, as many people suppose, the only way to solve this problem is the prolongation of the prison period. In contrast, other people state that it is insufficient and such a situation needs more effective actions. In this essay I will examine both these views and try to offer my own solution. On the one hand, as the first group of people believe, the level of crime (which raised dramatically in last decades, as different surveys demonstrate it) can be reduced only by keeping ""evil"" in the prison for as much time as possible. Firstly, it can truly protect the society from those criminals who had already showed its deviant behaviour. Furthermore, the amount of recidives is so sizeable that it must be taken into consideration. Secondly, during the whole period of its existence, humanity did not provide any more effective ways to stop criminals than puninshment - and if this punishment is strictrer, the criminals would afraid to get in prison. Lastly, such a way does not any modifications in the current state system since the prison net already exists - hence it is more affordable for the government.  On the other hand, the first position is often refuted by the second group of people. They state that prison system is not up-to-date and can not reduce crime even if the prison sentences would be longer. First of all, it should be taken into account that the influence of the prisons on reducing crime is not proved by the surveys, and the fact of recedives demonstrate that prisons can not ""correct"" people. Apart from that, the prison system itself is utterly expensive for the government and hence need more and more taxes from the simple citizens; undoubtedly, the prolongation of the prison period would impact on the cost of its maintenance. Therefore, several alternative ways of reducing crime are offered. For instance, some people suppose that the development of the policy system can help to stop the crime events instead of stricter punishments after this event. Moreover, the society can influence on criminals ""softer"" than by strict prisons and try to prevent the situation when an ordinary man becomes a criminal. Namely, the government should help poor families and their children since they are mostly predisposed to crime (as the example of African, some Asian and other poor countries demonstrate it). Finally, the education and moral systems should be improved in order to enhance the moral self-control of each member of the society. All in all, I partly agree with both these views and, furthermore, I suppose that they are not so contrast as they seem. From my point of view (despite the fact that my opinion may seem too superficial), all these ways may be combined in order to prevent the human from crime and to reduce the amount of such situations. The government is obliged to strict the prison conditions and simultaneously develop systems which can influence people's minds more effectively - education or moral system (including schools and universities), supporting those who can not provide themselves without a crime. If all these methods are gathered, it will truly contribute to reducing crime in modern society.  ",70,2,1

It may be a business trip or a journey to have a rest and relax from the daily routine.
On the other hand, there are many people who are agree that this kind of transport is very convenient. A lot of factors may prove it. First of all, travelling by plane let people minimize time spending on the road, because plane is the fastest variant among all transport. Especially it is appropriate for people who has a limit in time because their work. Secondly, businessmans can not imagine their life without air transport, because in this case time is equal to their money. Travelling be plane gives such persons an opportunity to do business on the international level (to deal with parthners from different countries personally). At last air travelling is accepted to be the safest type of transport and that is why the majority of people choose it if they can afford.
On the other hand, there are people who really afford governments' point of view and want to reduce the number of flights for work and leisure. Inspite of all advantages of this kind of transport, they are sure that it badly influences the environment by polluting air that can lead to the global warming.
To some extant these people are right. Becides polluting air the plane is made of alluminium, that is not ecological metal. So, this kind of transport not only pollutes the enivironment but it is made of unusegul material. If all people imagine, what will be with our Earth, may be some persons will change their opinion and start using land transport such as trains. Or, for example, sea transport.
To sum up, there are two points of view concerning air travel. To take in attention everything mentiones above, we can notice that pluses of this type of transport are outweight minuses. Of course, everybody shoud decide what will be better for himself. Personally, I, am sure that governments should not take laws with aim to reduce the number of air flights, because it is a normal natural development, that people try to make their life better.

On the one hand it seems to be quite bad and even unfair that local films are not so popular than British and American ones. May be there is a problem in advertising, may be we should start watching local films just for their improving. But on the other hand everything has its reasons. If people prefer British and American films, they must be better than the ones produced in the local industries. Goverments of our cities do not spent so much money on producing films. As a result there are less special effects, less decorations and other thing than in American and British films. But the most important thing is people who make these films, who write and think about story line, who produse all the action and who act. If local goverments want to make film industries better and more popular, they should pay attention to people, who work there, to their education and, of coure, on their salaries. What about other ways to help local industries, we must not forget about advertising, which is important for popularity of films, but it can not help if films and the process of their producing needs improvement.

It is actually in cities, because city is uncial place for living, it is antonym for ‘wild routine’. Cities has their own weather and climat, it is first cause of problems, like cold feats, but it is not general. There is more massive problems, like transport or factories.

Firstly, I talk about transport. It call 2 types of problems: contemporary problems with health from transport is, for example, if you are hit by car and now your arm is broken. Long-lasting problem from transport is gases in air, gases from engines, can’t name a problem but I know then breathing by period wastes is not so helpful for your body. We can solve that problems, if we use electro-engines or something like that. Secondly, big problem is factories, of course. One factory can do a lot of things, legal or nor, that causes problems with our health. For example, factory put wastes to nearly lake, fish in lake eat wastes and became not so good for eating, but we don’t know it, and that fish was killed and served to our kitchen table, and after that we had stomach problems.

Well, modern technology society causes a lot of troubles to routine, and sometimes we forget that we are nature, and we make problems for ourselves. Mankind makes troubles to mankind, and we must control this situation.

One of the most significant reasons of this trend is that the level of violence among young people has risen; they don't respect the law, and it's high time to explain them that crime is not good. So, parents, teachers and the government should help them.
For beggining, it is important to understand the reasons of their behaviour. First of all, there is a lot of crime on TV and the Internet. If we turn on a TV, we will see how people kill each other and other schenes of violence. Thus, young people can think that crime isn't something unusual if they see it everyday. Secondly, today young people have a feeling of freedom, and they think that a person can do whatever he wants even if it is a crime. Thirdly, maybe it is the main cause of their behaviour, today it is the high rate of unemployment in the world. So, young people don't have a job; however, they have a lot of free time and need money. As the result, a crime is a possible solution for them.
Nevertheless, the issue isn't extremly complicated. If parents explain their children the harm from the violence, they will not make crimes. In addition, speial lecturers can be created in schools to show the possible punishments for criminality. Moreover, the government should create job places for young people; it will help them to find money.
To sum up, the problem can be solved if we pay more attention for it. The support from family, school and the government will help young people to find their place in life.

While some people argue that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. I think, that prisoning itself is not a good way of punishment for the majority of criminlas. There are a lot can be said in favour of my point of view. First of all, in prisons people study to do the worse crime because of the environment of punishment and criminal. As a small, a lot of ex-prisoners commit a crime again. However, many prisoners did not do some dangerous crime like murdering, so they are not a heard for society nd should not be kept behind the bars. Also, some of them are just ill people and rehabilitation courses will help them more than imprisonment. On the other hand, for dangerous criminals it would be nice to give them longer sentence, but in this way government should pay attention to the problem of finding work for ex-prisoners. It is very widespread problem that should be solved in order to prevent some new crime from this people. Actually, I think that some fees and social works will be better for the vast majority of people that now are in prisons. It will save lots of money for government and make judgment system more loyal to people. To conclude I want to say that society  will be better if imprisonment would not be the most common and the main way of punishment. In addition, I think that loyal atmosphere to people in prison like it is in Norway will reduce some repeat of crime and people would try to improve themselves instead of being the worst criminals. Maybe in the future fees and social works will replace prisoning and, personally, I think it will be better for criminals and society.

  Overall, it is clear that the oldest underground railway system is in London, so kilometres of route compose the highest point, 394 kilometres. Talking about Tokyo about 1927 million passengers use this mode of transport per year. Also, it can be seen that in Los Angeles the underground railway system was opened therteen year ago, so it has only 28 kilometres of route. Moreover in Kyoto and Los Angeles this type of transport is not so popular, because it is used only by 45 and 60 million passengers per year respectively. By contrast, in Paris 1191 million passengers per year prefer using underground and kilometres of route compose 199 points.

They can see the world, meet a lot of interest people and make a right decision, Secondly, they can earn enough money for studing at university which they want to study.

This thend seems to have its own advantages, but at the same time it has its drawbacks. In the following essay they both will be considered compared with. On the one hand, the such a development appeares to bring significant benefits both to the countries where buisnesses are moved and to the companies that act in this way. For companies it is good, firstly, because in developing countries there are no as many rivals as in developed ones; therefore, these international companies can almost totaly occupy corresponding spheres, market sectors, etc. Secondly, local employees in developed countries require significantly bigger salaries; consequently, the companies moving their businesses to developing countries can spent less money on workers. As for local habitants, they have more opportunities to find job and can be sure of the quality of production they get from these companies.  However, in such a development there are several disadvantages. Maybe the main of them, for instanse, is that occuping spheres of their buisnesses they hardly leave a chance for local developers to run their own buisnesses. As a consequence of that predominance of international companies, it can be argued that because of monopolies which are established in this way it becomes difficult to control quality, prices, etc. All in all, it can be said that the disadvantages noted in the essay although being unpleasant in some ways do not outweigh the advantages, for a developing country receiving an international company gains experience and approaches to the level of devepoled countries. Therefore, if sometime in the future it decides to develop its own businesses, it will have enough money, educated people and other resources to do that.",70,2,2
